Methamphetamine contains an additional methyl substitution at RN, a substitution which is shared with MDMA, methcathinone, and mephedrone.\n\nStereoisomers\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers the medical approval, prescription uses, and chemical structure of methamphetamine, including its classification as N-methylamphetamine within the amphetamine family, its molecular core, and shared substitutions with other psychoactive substances like MDMA.
