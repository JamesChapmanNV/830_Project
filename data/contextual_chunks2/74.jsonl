It is a first-generation H1 antihistamine that is widely used as a generic, over-the-counter medication to treat allergies. When exceeding approved doses, diphenhydramine produces powerful deliriant effects.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of diphenhydramine, highlighting its classification as a deliriant and common over-the-counter antihistamine known as DPH or Benadryl. It emphasizes the risks of high-dose use, including dangerous and unpleasant experiences, and advises harm reduction practices. This information is essential for understanding the substance’s effects, risks, and safety considerations within the broader drug profile.\n                "}

In comparison to other hallucinogens, DPH has been reported to have significantly less abuse potential than other hallucinogens. This is simply because the vast majority of people who try it do not wish to repeat the experience.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of DPH develops with repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 1 - 2 weeks for tolerance to return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption).
