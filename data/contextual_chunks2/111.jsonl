The most common are various over-the-counter antihistamines, cold remedies and sleeping aids (including Benadryl, Sominex, Sleep-Eze D and several generic brands).

Diphenhydramine causes drowsiness, lethargy, and sleep even at doses recommended for anti-histamine use. The dosages below are reflective of recreational use where users take doses 4-20 times the recommended dose, stay awake, and try to enjoy the \"drunken\", delusional state.
