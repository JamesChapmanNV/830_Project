It is a moderately potent opioid analgesic, generally used for relief of moderate to severe pain. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and an antitussive. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a semisynthetic derivative. It is functionally related to a thebaine. It is a conjugate base of an oxycodone(1+). It derives from a hydride of a morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a detailed chemical overview of oxycodone, including its PubChem CID, structural images, safety classifications, molecular formula, synonyms, molecular weight, creation and modification dates, and a comprehensive description of its chemical properties, pharmacological role, origin, and uses. It complements the full document’s extensive chemical, pharmacological, safety, and regulatory data, serving as a key reference for identification and basic chemical properties within the broader context of opioid analysis and drug information.\n                "}

It is currently indicated as an immediate release product for moderate to severe pain and as an extended release product for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period. The first oxycodone containing product, Percodan, was approved by the FDA on April 12, 1950.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nOxycodone Hydrochloride (has salt form);\n\n\n\nOxycodone Terephthalate (has salt form);\n\n\n\nOxycodone hydrochloride trihydrate (is active moiety of) ...

These tissues include the respiratory centre in the brain stem, the cough centre in the medulla, muscles of the pupils, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and immune system. Oxycodone's effect on the respiratory centre is dose dependant respiratory depression. The action on the cough centre is suppression of the cough reflex. Pupils become miopic or decrease in size, peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract slows, and muscle tone in the colon may increase causing constipation. In the cardiovascular system histamine may be released leading to pruritis, red eyes, flushing, sweating, and decreased blood pressure. Endocrine effects may include increased prolactin, decreased cortisol, and decreased testosterone.

CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with less contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone with an AUC ratio of 0.6 relative to that of oxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information on oxycodone's metabolic pathways, highlighting CYP3A4 as the primary enzyme converting oxycodone to noroxycodone, and CYP2D6's role in forming oxymorphone.

Oxycodone and its active metabolites, noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone are opioid agonists. These compounds passively diffuse across the blood brain barrier or may be actively transported across by an unknown mechanism. Oxycodone and its active metabolites can selectively bind to the mu opioid receptor, but also the kappa and delta opioid receptors in the central nervous system and periphery, and induce a G protein coupled receptor signalling pathway. Activation of mu opioid receptors inhibits N-type voltage operated calcium channels, inhibiting responses to pain.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on the mechanism of action of oxycodone, highlighting that its full mechanism is not fully understood but involves binding to multiple opioid receptors and inhibiting calcium channels to produce analgesia.

The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.\n\nUS Natl Inst Health; DailyMed.

Acute overdose can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death.

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase.

In 2014, the FDA warned against the use of opioid combinations in which the dose of acetaminophen is greater than 325 mg per tablet or unit dose.

Sedation in breastfed infants has occurred after maternal use of oxycodone. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Daily doses of less than 60 mg of the immediate-release formulation are unlikely to result in clinically relevant exposures in breastfed infants. Extended-release oxycodone products (such as OxyContin) are not recommended in nursing mothers. If oxycodone is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral oxycodone (and combinations) to a 2 to 3 days, especially in the outpatient setting.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt falls within the detailed section on oxycodone's pharmacology and usage, specifically addressing effects during pregnancy and lactation. It provides guidance on maternal opioid use while breastfeeding, highlighting the risk of infant drowsiness and CNS depression, and recommending cautious use of extended-release formulations. This information is relevant for understanding oxycodone's safety profile in maternal and neonatal contexts.\n                "}

A 30 mg daily limit appears to offer the same benefits to the mother as higher dosages for mothers after cesarean section.

Monitor the infant closely for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants.
