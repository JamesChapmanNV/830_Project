It was originally developed as a novel anti-epileptic for the treatment of certain types of seizures - today it is also widely used to treat neuropathic pain. Gabapentin has some stark advantages as compared with other anti-epileptics, such as a relatively benign adverse effect profile, wide therapeutic index, and lack of appreciable metabolism making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic drug interactions.. It is structurally and functionally related to another GABA derivative, [pregabalin].\n\nThe physiologic effect of gabapentin is by means of Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nGabapentin Enacarbil (active moiety of).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\nGabapentin.png\n\n1.2 3D Conformer\n\n1.3 Crystal Structures\n\n1 of 7\n\nView All\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This extract provides an overview of gabapentin's chemical structure, approval history, pharmacological advantages, and mechanism of action, situating it within the comprehensive PubChem compound profile.

It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats. Gabapentin is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used in caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. Gabapentin has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity. This reaction can prove fatal and early symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash should be promptly investigated.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAntimanic Agents\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This segment summarizes gabapentin's pharmacological mechanisms, including its anti-convulsant action of inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release, its therapeutic index, and seizure-specific efficacy.

Unlike gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil is absorbed via high-capacity transporters throughout the GI tract and is not affected by saturable absorption; this improves bioavailability of the drug and allows for dose-proportional exposure. Food has only a minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of conventional (immediate-release) formulations of gabapentin, but increases the bioavailability of gabapentin gastroretentive tablets. Administration of gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets with food also increases systemic exposure of the drug compared with exposure under fasted conditions.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the pharmacokinetic differences between conventional gabapentin and gabapentin enacarbil, emphasizing absorption, bioavailability, and food effects. It is relevant within the broader document's detailed drug profile, highlighting formulation-specific properties and factors influencing systemic exposure, key for understanding gabapentin's clinical and research considerations.\n                "}

While preliminary animal studies have suggested the effectiveness of gabapentin in successfully treating visceral pain, the mechanism underlying its analgesic effect remains unclear. Evidence from other studies has demonstrated the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) in the pathogenesis of visceral inflammatory pain. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that gabapentin produces analgesia for visceral inflammatory pain through its inhibitory effect on the PKC-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Intracolonic injections of formalin were performed in rats to produce colitis pain. Our results showed that visceral pain behaviors in these rats decreased after intraperitoneal injection of gabapentin. These behaviors were also reduced by intrathecal injections of the PKC inhibitor, H-7, and the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes research on gabapentin's potential mechanism of analgesia for visceral inflammatory pain, highlighting its inhibition of PKC-ERK1/2 signaling pathways in rat models.

In animal models of neuropathic pain, gabapentinoids exert an anti-allodynic action within 30 minutes but most of their in vitro effects are 30-fold slower, taking at least 17 hours to develop.

This anhydride is treated with methanol to yield the half ester 2-[1-(methoxycarbonyl)cyclohexyl]acetic acid, which is subjected to a Curtius type rearrangement to give the isocyanate 2-[1-(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexyl]acetic acid.

Gabapentin increases the synaptic concentration of GABA, enhances GABA responses at non-synaptic sites in neuronal tissues, and reduces the release of mono-amine neurotransmitters. One of the mechanisms implicated in this effect of gabapentin is the reduction of the axon excitability measured as an amplitude change of the presynaptic fibre volley (FV) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. This is mediated through its binding to presynaptic NMDA receptors. Other studies have shown that the antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects of gabapentin are mediated by the descending noradrenergic system, resulting in the activation of spinal alpha2-adrenergic receptors. Gabapentin has also been shown to bind and activate the adenosine A1 receptor.\n\n12.1.2 USGS Health-Based Screening Levels for Evaluating Water-Quality\n\nChemical\n\nGabapentin\n\nChemical Classes\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nReference\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details gabapentin's neuropharmacological mechanisms, including its interactions with calcium channels, GABA modulation, and neuronal excitability, relevant for understanding its therapeutic effects.

The latency to onset in these reports was 1 to 8 weeks and associated with cholestatic pattern of enzyme elevations. Fever and rash have been described but not autoantibody formation.
