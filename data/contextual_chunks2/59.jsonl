It is a Depressants substance.\n\nA hallucinogen formerly used as a veterinary anesthetic, and briefly as a general anesthetic for humans. Phencyclidine is similar to ketamine in structure and in many of its effects. Like ketamine, it can produce a dissociative state. It exerts its pharmacological action through inhibition of NMDA receptors (receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate). As a drug of abuse, it is known as PCP and Angel Dust.\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\nPhencyclidine.png\n\n1.2 3D Conformer\n\n2 Names and Identifiers\n\n2.1 Computed Descriptors\n\n2.1.1 IUPAC Name\n\n1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine\n\nComputed by Lexichem TK 2.7.0 (PubChem release 2025.04.14)\n\n2.1.2 InChI\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed chemical identifiers, pharmacological classification, and structural information for phencyclidine, including its DEA Schedule II status, chemical structure representations, and key descriptors like IUPAC name and InChI, crucial for chemical identification and regulatory context within the full comprehensive dataset.\n                "}

The “out-of-body” intense psychological and behavioral effects of low doses of phencyclidine led to its abuse. In the late 1960s and 1970s, phencyclidine (“angel dust”) became a widely used hallucinogenic drug. The effects were often extreme, marked by acute psychosis and aggressive and violent behaviors, and overdoses led to many emergency room visits and deaths from status epilepticus, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis and subsequent renal, respiratory and hepatic failure.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides key pharmacological and toxicological data on phencyclidine, including PubMed citations, associated chemicals, and a detailed LiverTox summary emphasizing its history as an abused hallucinogen with severe psychosis, behavioral effects, and overdose risks. It enhances the comprehensiveness of the full webpage by highlighting both research references and clinical safety information relevant for medical, toxicological, and pharmacological research on PCP.\n                "}

This bizarre behavior, characterized by confusion, vivid dreaming, and hallucinations, is termed an \"emergence reaction\". These reactions occur most frequently in middle-aged men, with a reported incidence of 17% to 30%. The most violent emergence reactions follow an intravenous dose of approximately 0.25 mg/kg (total: 20 mg) of phencyclidine. The mildest degrees of agitation produced by phencyclidine resemble the effects of ethanol intoxication.\n\nGoldfrank, L.R., Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies 9th Ed. 2011., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y., p. 1196\n\nBreast feeding should be avoided after phencyclidine use, but a sufficient duration of abstinence is undefined.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt references a 1964 review by Domine EF on the therapeutic uses of phencyclidine (PCP) and highlights drug warnings related to its clinical use, particularly the risk of acute psychosis and emergence reactions, including incidence rates and effects at specific doses.

It is a major excitatory receptor in the brain. Normal physiological function requires that the activated receptor fluxes positive ions through the channel part of the receptor. PCP enters the ion channel from the outside of the neuron and binds, reversibly, to a site in the channel pore, blocking the flux of positive ions into the cell. PCP therefore inhibits depolarization of neurons and interferes with cognitive and other functions of the nervous system.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the mechanism of action of phencyclidine (PCP) as an NMDA receptor antagonist, explaining how PCP blocks ion flux in neurons and disrupts neural function.

Administration of PCP to rodents is used as a preclinical model for schizophrenia; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the symptoms remain largely unknown. Acute PCP treatment rapidly induces behavioral and cognitive deficits; therefore, post-translational regulation of protein activity is expected to play a role at early time points. We performed mass-spectrometry-driven quantitative analysis of rat frontal cortex 15, 30, or 240 min after the administration of PCP (10 mg/kg).

PCP also induces behavioral and cognitive abnormalities in non-human animals, and PCP-treated animals are considered a reliable pharmacological model of schizophrenia. However, the exact neural mechanisms by which PCP modulates behavior are not known. During the last decade several studies have indicated that disturbed activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be closely related to PCP-induced psychosis. Systemic administration of PCP produces long-lasting activation of medial PFC (mPFC) neurons in rats, almost in parallel with augmentation of locomotor activity and behavioral stereotypies. Later studies have showed that such PCP-induced behavioral abnormalities are ameliorated by prior administration of drugs that normalize or inhibit excess excitability of PFC neurons.

The recovery of PCP after solid-phase extraction was greater than 90% with the lower limit of detection (LLOD) for PCP in 500 uL of human serum after solid-phase extraction at 0.06 ng ml-1. This method was used to determine the levels of PCP in postmortem human blood samples. The LLOD in blood was 1 ng ml-1. Blood PCP concentrations were also determined separately using GC and flame ionization detection (FID). Blood calibration standards and serum calibration standards yielded similar concentrations when used to quantitate authentic human blood samples that tested positive for PCP under the GC-FID method. Extraction of PCP from serum required fewer steps and therefore could be used as a calibration matrix in place of blood. The LC-MS/MS methodology shown here was higher throughput compared with GC-based methods because of very short chromatographic run times. This was accomplished without sacrificing analytical sensitivity.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details advanced analytical methods for detecting PCP in biological samples, including solid-phase extraction, LC-MS/MS validation with high accuracy (R² > 0.997), and detection limits (0.06 ng/mL in serum, 1 ng/mL in blood).

In 2010, there was an estimated 53,542 emergency department visits associated with PCP use, according to Drug Abuse Warning Network (New DAWN ED). This is a significant increase from an estimated 37,266 PCP-associated visits in 2008. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) National Poison Data System reports 747 PCP exposure case mentions and 350 single exposures in 2010. According to the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 6.1 million (2.4%) individuals in the U.S., aged 12 and older, reported using PCP in their lifetime. The Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey indicates that PCP use among 12th graders in the past year increased from 1.0% in 2010 to 1.3% in 2011 and then decreased to 0.9% in 2012.[US DEA; Drugs and Chemicals of Concern.

It is a Schedule II Controlled Substance. PCP was formerly used as a preinduction anesthetic and as an animal tranquilizer. It has no current medical indications, although it is still used illegally as a hallucinogen. HUMAN STUDIES: PCP causes distortion of perception and produces a feeling of detachment of dissociation from the user's surroundings and self. It is not a classic hallucinogen but better described as a dissociative agent or anesthetic. The hallmark of PCP toxicity is the recurring delusion of superhuman strength and invulnerability resulting from both its anesthetic and dissociative properties. There are case reports of patients presenting with trauma either from jumping from high altitudes, fighting large crowds or the police, or self-mutilation. Children have become intoxicated by ingesting the butts of used PCP-impregnated cigarettes or from passive inhalation of sidestream smoke.

Recent research on the contributing factors toward chronic use of nicotine-containing products has implicated the role of reinforcement-enhancing effects of nicotine. The present study investigates whether phencyclidine (PCP) may also possess a reinforcement-enhancement effect and how this may interact with the reinforcement-enhancement effect of nicotine.

PCP and nicotine separately increased active lever pressing for a visual stimulus in a dose-dependent manner and across the different FR schedules. The addition of PCP to nicotine did not increase lever-pressing for the visual stimulus, possibly due to a ceiling effect.

PCP abuse by pregnant women has been reported to result in the birth of infants exhibiting irritability, jitteriness and hyperactivity with high pitched cries. The present study was designed to evaluate the distribution of PCP in the maternal and fetal brain and the neurochemical effects produced by gestational exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated sc with 5 mg/kg PCP on 3 consecutive days (GD 9-11, 12-14, 15-16, or 18-20). On gestational day 21 all rats were killed by decapitation and maternal and fetal blood was collected for PCP analysis. Brains were dissected from dams and fetuses for PCP and neurochemical analyses.

However, occupational exposure to phencyclidine should be low or non-existent since phencyclidine is not legally produced in the US. The general public is not likely to be exposed to phencyclidine. Use data indicates exposure to phencyclidine among the general population is likely limited to individuals involved in its illegal manufacture and individuals who engage in illicit use of products containing phencyclidine, via inhalation of powder, inhalation of smoke and ingestion. (SRC)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the primary routes of human exposure to phencyclidine, emphasizing occupational risks for law enforcement during illicit drug handling and highlighting that general population exposure is limited mainly to those involved in illegal manufacture or use, through inhalation or ingestion. It situates within a comprehensive analysis of phencyclidine's toxicity, safety, and environmental impact in the full document.\n                "}
