Mitragynine (1 nM-3 uM) inhibited the ileum contraction elicited by electrical stimulation, and its pD2 value was 6.91 +/- 0.04 (n = 5). Morphine (1 nM-1 uM) also inhibited the electrically stimulated contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (pD2 7.68 +/- 0.11; n = 5). Mitragynine was 10 fold less potent than morphine. Mitragynine (3-10 uM) did not show any effect on the smooth muscle contraction induced by acetylcholine or histamine. Naloxone (10-300 nM) reversed the inhibitory effect of mitragynine on electrically stimulated contraction. Furthermore, naloxone showed a shift of concentration-response curve of mitragynine to the right.
