Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. It is a Opiates substance.\n\nFentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia. Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia. Fentanyl is related to other opioids like [morphine] and [oxycodone]. Fentanyl's high potency has also made it a common adulterant in illicit drugs, especially heroin. In 2017, 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths). Opioid overdoses kill an average of 11 Canadians daily. Fentanyl was FDA approved in 1968.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nFentanyl Citrate (has salt form);\n\n\n\nFentanyl Hydrochloride (has salt form).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\nFentanyl.png\n\n1.2 3D Conformer\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a summary of fentanyl's classification as a DEA Schedule II controlled substance, its development in the 1950s, and its medical and illicit use, including high overdose involvement in 2017 and FDA approval in 1968.

Fatal respiratory depression has occurred in patients treated with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, including following use in opioid non-tolerant patients and improper dosing. The substitution of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose. Due to the risk of respiratory depression, oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and in opioid non-tolerant patients. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must be kept out of reach of children. The concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. /Fentanyl citrate lozenge/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from section 7.15 provides critical drug warnings and boxed safety precautions associated with fentanyl, emphasizing the risk of fatal respiratory depression, contraindications, and safety measures for opioid-tolerant and non-tolerant patients.

Activation of opioid receptors causes GTP to be exchanged for GDP on the G-proteins which in turn down regulates adenylate cyclase, reducing concentrations of cAMP.

It is not a single drug, but typically contains several potent opioids, including whatever a drug dealer has on hand in varying proportions. It has a potency much higher than heroin and is reportedly administered via injection, ingestion, insufflation, and smoking.

Competitive ionization studies highlight that detection of these compounds in the presence of heroin is readily achievable, down to 0.1% fentanyl by mass with TD-DART-MS.

The terrorists threatened to kill everyone inside unless Russia ended the war in Chechnya. Although the Chechen militants agreed to release some of the hostages during the first couple of days, negotiations with the Russian authorities eventually stalled. Just before dawn on October 26, Russian special police units resorted to using an incapacitating gas based on the drug fentanyl to end the crisis. All of the Chechen militants were killed, and most of the civilian captives survived. But while the operation was largely a success, at least 117 of the hostages died from the effects of the gas. /Incapacitating gas based on the drug fentanyl/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a historical incident involving the use of fentanyl-based incapacitating gas during the 2002 Moscow theater crisis, highlighting fentanyl's role in mass casualty events and its serious toxicological effects.

Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Fentanyl's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine.

Several studies have demonstrated that 5-HT1A receptor agonists alleviate opioid-induced respiratory depression in rodent models. However, there are conflicting reports regarding their effects on analgesia due in part to varied agonist receptor selectivity and presence of anesthesia. Therefore the authors performed a study in rats with befiradol (F13640 and NLX-112), a highly selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist without anesthesia. Respiratory neural discharge was measured using in vitro preparations. Plethysmographic recording, nociception testing, and righting reflex were used to examine respiratory ventilation, analgesia, and sedation, respectively.
