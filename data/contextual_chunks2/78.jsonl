However, others produce CYP2D6 enzymes in higher quantities which can result in hypersensitivity to the drug. Some methods of potentiating opioids, such as using grapefruit juice throughout the day before consumption, inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme.[6] This results in less codeine being converted into norcodeine which leaves more to be metabolized into morphine[citation needed].
