It comes in a variety of forms, but is virtually always taken orally. Today, LSD is most commonly found in the form of small squares of paper called 'blotter' (full sheets of paper are decorated with artwork or designs, perforated, then soaked in liquid LSD solution and dried). Other forms include pills, gelatin sheets or shapes (pyramids, cubes, etc), liquid, liquid sugar cubes, and powder. Blotter is most common because it is easily produced, easily concealable and the format allows for few adulterant chemicals.\n\n[ Main LSD Vault ]\n\nDose #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of LSD, including its common forms, appearance, and methods of ingestion, as part of Erowid's detailed drug information resource. It is relevant for users seeking foundational knowledge about LSD's presentation and usage, aiding in identification and understanding of the substance within the broader context of psychoactive drugs.\n                "}

A single hit of most blotter paper contains somewhere in this range, though this varies depending on the source and there is no way for the average user to determine the strength of a piece of blotter other than by word of mouth. In the 1960s and 1970s, when LSD came primarily in pill form, the average single dosage unit was somewhat higher than it is with today's blotter, more often in the 200-400 ug range. A drop of liquid can contain a huge amount of LSD but is generally made so that one drop is a single medium dose.\n\nPrice #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed dosage and pricing information for LSD within the broader psychedelic substance overview.

Captive markets such as raves generally produce high prices while friend to friend it is often sold at cheaper prices. Less common forms of LSD sell for somewhat higher prices ($8-10 for a single hit), and as with most substances, the price goes down if you buy in bulk. Sheets of 100 hits (blotter) generally range from $1-$2 per hit.

As the effects become stronger, a wide variety of perceptual changes may occur; non-specific mental and physical stimulation, pupil dilation, closed and open eye patterning and visuals, changed thought patterns, feelings of insight, confusion, or paranoia, and quickly changing emotions (happiness, fear, giddiness, anxiety, anger, joy, irritation).\n\nOnset #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides key terminology, slang, and effects descriptions for LSD, including common references and initial perceptual and emotional effects during onset.

The strong peak/plateu effects last around 6-10 hours.
