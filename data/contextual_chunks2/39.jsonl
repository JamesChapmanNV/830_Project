It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an opioid analgesic and an antitussive. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a morphinane-like compound. It derives from a hydride of a morphinan.\n\nHydrocodone is a DEA Schedule II controlled substance. Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This extract provides a detailed overview of hydrocodone's chemical identity, safety information, and pharmacological description, aligning with the full webpage's comprehensive data on the compound's structure, properties, regulatory status, and biological effects. It summarizes key identifiers such as PubChem CID, molecular formula, weight, synonyms, and classification as a semi-synthetic opioid and Schedule II controlled substance, crucial for chemical and pharmacological searches. The content supports efficient retrieval of fundamental data points and safety profile details within the broader scientific and regulatory context.\n                "}

Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.\n\nHydrocodone is a synthetic opioid derivative of codeine. It is commonly used in combination with [acetaminophen] to control moderate to severe pain. Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by [dextromethorphan] in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite, [hydromorphone] has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain. The FDA first approved Hydrocodone for use as part of the cough suppressant syrup Hycodan in March of 1943.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nHydrocodone Bitartrate (has salt form);\n\n\n\nBenzhydrocodone Hydrochloride (is active moiety of);\n\n\n\nHydrocodone hydrochloride (is active moiety of).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides a legal classification overview of hydrocodone as a DEA Schedule II controlled substance, its origin as a synthetic opioid derived from codeine, and its common uses including pain management and cough suppression.

Though hydromorphone is active it is not present in sufficient quantities to contribute significantly to hydrocodone's therapeutic effects. Both hydrocodone and hydromorphone form 6-α- and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites through 6-ketoreduction. The hydroxy metabolites and hydromorphone can form glucuronide conjugates. Hydrocodone also undergoes oxidative N-demthylation to norhydrocodone. O-demethylation is primarily catalyzed by CYP2D6 while N-demethylation is primarily CYP3A4.\n\nLike other phenanthrene derivatives, hydrocodone is probably metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly in urine. Metabolism of hydrocodone includes O-demethylation, N-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction.\n\nAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2015; Drug Information 2015.

Maternal use of oral opioids during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, which may progress to rare but severe central nervous system depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. If hydrocodone is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral hydrocodone to 2 to 3 days at a maximum dosage of 30 mg daily with close infant monitoring.
