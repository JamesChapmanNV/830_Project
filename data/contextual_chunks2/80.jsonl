Further, the benzodiazepine ring is bonded at R5 to a 2-chlorinated phenyl ring. R7 of the benzyl ring is also substituted with a chlorine group. Additionally, Lorazepam contains a hydroxy (OH-) group substituted at R3. It also contains an oxygen group double bonded to R2 of its diazepine ring to form a ketone. This oxygen substitution at R2 is shared with other benzodiazepine drugs with the suffix -azepam.\n\nPharmacology\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This segment provides detailed information on lorazepam's chemical structure and pharmacological properties, forming the basis for understanding its effects, risks, and legal classification discussed throughout the document.

This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as barbiturates and alcohol since they work in a similar fashion, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABAA receptor, thus their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABAA receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer[19]. Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and properly.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the cross-tolerance of lorazepam with other benzodiazepines and provides critical information on overdose risks, especially when combined with other GABAergic depressants like alcohol and barbiturates, emphasizing the potential for life-threatening medical emergencies.\n                "}
