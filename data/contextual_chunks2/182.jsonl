Because of this, the detection periods for MDMA are very similar to those for amphetamines. Also, many tablets of street ecstasy are not pure MDMA and frequently includes amphetamines (and may also contain DXM, caffeine, MDA, MDE, ephedrine etc) which may trigger drug tests. The U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT) added MDMA, MDA, and MDE to their amphetamine portion of their \"5 panel\" test. See DOT Drug Testing: On and After Oct 1, 2010 - Still a 5 Panel. Amphetamines are standardly detectable in urine for 24-96 hours after use (72 average). Methamphetamines stay in the system slightly longer, 24-120 hours.\n\nHair Testing\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed information on drug testing methods for MDMA, including urinalysis and hair tests, detection periods, and substances that may cause false positives, relevant for understanding MDMA detection in toxicology reports within the broader context of drug information.\n                "}
