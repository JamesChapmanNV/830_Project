A centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant, it is used as its hydrochloride salt in the symptomatic treatment of painful muscle spasm. It has a role as a muscle relaxant, a tranquilizing drug and an antidepressant. It derives from a hydride of a dibenzo[a,d][7]annulene.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed chemical identifiers, structural information, safety data, and pharmacological descriptions for cyclobenzaprine, a central muscle relaxant with uses in pain relief and potential antidepressant effects. It includes molecular formula, weight, synonyms, and key dates, situating these critical chemical and safety details within the comprehensive PubChem webpage content for research and drug reference purposes.\n                "}

Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.\n\nCyclobenzaprine is a Muscle Relaxant.

Improvement is manifested by relief of muscle spasm and its associated signs and symptoms, namely, pain, tenderness, limitation of motion, and restriction in activities of daily living. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be used only for short periods (up to two or three weeks) because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use is not available and because muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions is generally of short duration and specific therapy for longer periods is seldom warranted.

Currently there are no standardized drug therapies for the treatment of tinnitus.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a tricyclic pharmacological agent, namely cyclobenzaprine for the relief of tinnitus complaints. 65 patients, who received the drug treatment, were compared to 30 patients on a waiting list, who received no treatment.

Despite its long half-life, it is relatively short-acting with a typical duration of action of 4-6 hours. Cyclobenzaprine has been reported to contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when used in combination with other serotonergic medications. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include autonomic instability, changes to mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities, or gastrointestinal symptoms - treatment with cyclobenzaprine should be discontinued immediately if any of these reactions occur during therapy.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nMuscle Relaxants, Central\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed pharmacological data on cyclobenzaprine, including its pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, and classification as a central muscle relaxant.

There is some evidence that cyclobenzaprine exerts its effects at the supraspinal level, specifically within the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, with little-to-no action at neuromuscular junctions or directly on skeletal musculature. Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity. More recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine’s observed effects.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the pharmacological mechanism of cyclobenzaprine, highlighting its uncertain human action and insights gained from animal studies.

One mother was taking 5 mg once daily for temporomandibular joint pain and the other mother was taking 10 mg twice daily for fibromyalgia pain. The latter mother was also taking unspecified antidepressants, levothyroxine, zolpidem, alprazolam and famotidine. Both mothers were breastfeeding their infants (extent not stated). Neither infant had any noticeable adverse reaction such as sedation.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on the effects of cyclobenzaprine during pregnancy and lactation, including its minimal transfer into breast milk and safety in breastfed infants.

Additionally, cyclobenzaprine antagonizes the alpha1 adrenergic receptor, causing a vasodilatory effect, and may contribute further to reflex tachycardia.
