Amphetamines are standardly detectable in urine for 1-3 days after use. Methamphetamines stay in the system slightly longer, 3-5 days. The Amphetamine test is a one step competitive immunoassay that is used to screen for the presence of amphetamine in urine. It is a chromatographic absorbent device in which drug or drug metabolites in a sample compete with drug conjugate immobilized on a porous membrane for a limited number of binding sites. This test is a rapid, qualitative immunoassay for the detection of amphetamine in urine. The cutoff concentration for this test is 1000 ng/ml, as recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The cutoff for GC-MS, which detects d-amphetamine and methamphetamine, is 500 ng/ml.\n\nHair Testing\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details drug testing methods for amphetamines, including urine and hair tests, their detection windows, testing procedures, cutoff levels, and factors causing false positives, providing essential information for understanding amphetamine detection in the broader context of drug analysis.\n                "}

Hair tests generally take the most recent 1.5 inches of growth and use those for testing. That provides a detection period of approximately 90 days. If an individual's hair is shorter than 1.5 inches, this detection period will be shorter.\n\nSaliva Testing\n\nIn the past few years, new technologies have been developed which allow for saliva testing for the presence of Methamphetamine and its derivatives.
