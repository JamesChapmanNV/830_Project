These compounds exert their effects by binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptor. This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the \"Pharmacology\" section explains how oxycodone binds to μ-opioid receptors to produce effects like euphoria, pain relief, and anxiolysis, highlighting its similarity to other opioids such as morphine and codeine.

Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice[10]. This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected[10]. Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.\n\nLegal issues\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This snippet discusses how grapefruit juice can affect the metabolism of opioids like oxycodone, tramadol, and fentanyl through CYP3A4 inhibition, potentially prolonging drug clearance and increasing toxicity. It also notes the metabolic pathway for codeine and hydrocodone via CYP2D6 and how genetic or medication-induced enzyme inhibition can impact their efficacy, highlighting important considerations for safe and effective opioid use within the broader context of drug effects, interactions, and harm reduction.\n                "}
