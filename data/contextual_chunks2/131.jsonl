NO Tested for in Extended Drug Tests ? NO Possible to Test for? YES Detection Period in Urine 3-4 days\n\nTEST TYPES #\n\nUrine Testing\n\nHydromorphone does not show up in the basic opiate test which is part of the standard pre-employment drug test. The opiate test tests primarily for morphine (which both codeine and heroin break down into). Hydromorphone does not break down into morphine, therefore it is not detected. As with most substances, hydromorphone is possible to test for, but this is extremely uncommon.\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details Erowid's drug testing information for hydromorphone, including detection periods, test types, and detection likelihood in standard and extended drug tests. It is part of the larger pharmaceutical and drug testing database, providing users with specific insights on hydromorphone's detectability in urinalysis, relevant to drug policy and health research.\n                "}
