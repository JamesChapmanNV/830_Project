Binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. It has a role as an anticonvulsant and a calcium channel blocker. It is functionally related to a gamma-aminobutyric acid.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides key chemical identifiers, structural images, safety classifications, and pharmacological descriptions of pregabalin (CID 5486971), highlighting its molecular formula, weight, synthesis dates, and mechanism of action as a gamma-amino acid targeting voltage-gated calcium channels. It is essential for retrieval of detailed drug information, including structure, safety, and pharmacology, within the comprehensive PubChem compound database.\n                "}

Substances in the DEA Schedule V have a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule IV and consist primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. It is a Depressants substance.\n\nPregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions. Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively characterized, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release). It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes pregabalin's legal classification as a DEA Schedule V controlled substance, its structural similarity to GABA, and its primary uses for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.

Pregabalin oral bioavailability is reported to be ≥90% regardless of the dose. Cmax is attained within 1.5 hours after single or multiple doses, and steady state is attained within 24-48 hours with repeated administration. Both Cmax and AUC appear to be dose proportional. Food decreases the rate of pregabalin absorption and as a result, lowers the Cmax by an estimated 25-30% and increases the Tmax to approximately 3 hours. However, the effect of food does not appear to impact the total absorption of pregabalin in a way that is clinically relevant. As a result, pregabalin can be administered with or without food.\n\nRoute of Elimination\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides details on pregabalin's pharmacokinetics, including absorption, bioavailability, effect of food intake, and route of elimination, within the broader chemical and pharmacological profile of pregabalin found on its PubChem webpage. It is essential for understanding the drug’s absorption efficiency, bioavailability over 90%, and renal excretion, which are key for researchers and clinicians evaluating pharmacological properties and dosing considerations.\n                "}

Further, based on preclinical studies, pregabalin does not appear to undergo racemization to the R enantiomer in the body.\n\nVolume of Distribution\n\nAfter oral administration of pregabalin, the reported apparent volume of distribution is roughly 0.5 L/kg. Although pregabalin is not very lipophilic, it is able to cross the blood brain barrier(BBB). System L transporters facilitate the transport of large amino acids across the BBB and it has been confirmed that pregabalin is a substrate. This information suggests that system L transporters are responsible for pregabalin uptake into the BBB. In rat models, pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta.\n\nClearance\n\nIn young healthy subjects the mean renal clearance is estimated to be 67.0 to 80.9 mL mL/min. Given pregabalin's lack of plasma protein binding, this clearance rate suggests that renal tubular reabsorption is involved.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details pregabalin's pharmacokinetics related to its elimination, distribution, and clearance.

In prelicensure clinical trials in diabetic neuropathy and epilepsy, therapy with pregabalin was not associated with an increased frequency of serum aminotransferase elevations or liver toxicity. Since its approval and more wide scale use, however, pregabalin has been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury. Most cases were mild and frequently without jaundice. The latency to onset of injury was short, symptoms of liver injury arising within 3 to 14 days. Both cholestatic and hepatocellular patterns of injury have been reported. Signs of hypersensitivity (fever, rash, eosinophilia) and autoimmunity were not present. Some cases have been severe and associated with marked jaundice and prolongation of the prothrombin time, but all cases ultimately resolved after the medication was stopped without evidence of residual injury.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses pregabalin's potential hepatotoxicity, summarizing limited evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing reports. It highlights that while early studies showed no liver toxicity, rare cases of mild to severe liver injury with short latency have been documented, with all cases resolving after discontinuation. This information is relevant for understanding the safety profile of pregabalin within the comprehensive toxicity and safety data provided in the larger document.\n                "}

Pharmacokinetic model predicted that a maternal dosage of 150 mg daily would not result in a therapeutic level in an exclusively breastfed infant of any age. If pregabalin is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but until more data become available, use caution while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. The manufacturer recommends that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity based on high-dose animal studies over a prolonged period. Pregabalin has been used to treat persistent nipple pain in a few women at an average starting dosage of 100 mg daily.\n\n◉ Effects in Breastfed Infants\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on pregnancy and lactation safety for pregabalin, summarizing current knowledge on its use during breastfeeding, its effects on infants, and clinical considerations. It is relevant for healthcare providers and researchers assessing pregabalin’s reproductive safety profile and guiding clinical recommendations during lactation. Key points include low drug levels in breastmilk, minimal adverse effects in infants, and precautionary guidance on breastfeeding during treatment.\n                "}
