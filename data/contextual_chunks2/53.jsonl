Morphine acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain but has a high potential for addiction, with tolerance and both physical and psychological dependence developing rapidly. Morphine is the most abundant opiate found in Papaver somniferum (the opium poppy). It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a vasodilator agent, an anaesthetic, a drug allergen and a geroprotector. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a tertiary amino compound and a morphinane alkaloid. It is a conjugate base of a morphine(1+). It derives from a hydride of a morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed chemical identifiers, molecular weight, key dates, and a comprehensive overview of morphine's pharmacological properties, roles, chemical classification, and biochemical characteristics, aligning with the full webpage's focus on detailed chemical and pharmacological data of morphine for research and medical reference.\n                "}

Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.\n\nMorphine, the main alkaloid of opium, was first obtained from poppy seeds in 1805. It is a potent analgesic, though its use is limited due to tolerance, withdrawal, and the risk of abuse. Morphine is still routinely used today, though there are a number of semi-synthetic opioids of varying strength such as [codeine], [fentanyl], [methadone], [hydrocodone], [hydromorphone], [meperidine], and [oxycodone]. Morphine was granted FDA approval in 1941.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nMorphine Sulfate (has salt form);\n\n\n\nMorphine Hydrochloride (has salt form);\n\n\n\nNicomorphine (is active moiety of) ...

These safety risks are potentially harmful interactions with numerous other medications, problems with the adrenal glands, and decreased sex hormone levels. We are requiring changes to the labels of all opioid drugs to warn about these risks. Opioids can interact with antidepressants and migraine medicines to cause a serious central nervous system reaction called serotonin syndrome, in which high levels of the chemical serotonin build up in the brain and cause toxicity. Taking opioids may lead to a rare, but serious condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol helps the body respond to stress. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as reduced interest in sex, impotence, or infertility.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from section 7.14 of the webpage provides important drug safety warnings issued by the FDA regarding opioids, highlighting risks such as serotonin syndrome, adrenal gland problems, and hormonal disturbances.

The bioavailability of morphine is 80-100%. There is significant first-pass metabolism, therefore oral doses are 6 times larger than parenteral doses to achieve the same effect. Morphine reaches steady-state concentrations after 24-48 hours. Parenteral morphine has a Tmax of 15 minutes and oral morphine has a Tmax of 90 minutes, with a Cmax of 283nmol/L. The AUC of morphine is 225-290nmol\\*h/L.\n\nRoute of Elimination\n\n70-80% of an administered dose is excreted within 48 hours. Morphine is predominantly eliminated in the urine with 2-10% of a dose recovered as the unchanged parent drug. 7-10% of a dose of morphine is eliminated in the feces.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed pharmacokinetic data on morphine, including absorption, bioavailability, time to steady state, and routes of elimination, supporting the comprehensive overview of morphine’s chemical, physical, and biological properties found throughout the document.

Morphine and its metabolites act as agonists of the mu and kappa opioid receptors. The mu-opioid receptor is integral to morphine's effects on the ventral tegmental area of the brain. Morphine's activation of the reward pathway is mediated by agonism of the delta-opioid receptor in the nucleus accumbens, while modification of the respiratory system and addiction disorder are mediated by agonism of the mu-opioid receptor.\n\nVisual analysis of the direct electroencephalograph has revealed that morphine /slowed/ the predominant frequency and /increased/ high-voltage delta activity.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the mechanisms of morphine's action, emphasizing that Morphine-6-glucuronide mediates about 85% of morphine's effects by acting on mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors in the brain's reward and respiratory centers.

The drug is also used parenterally as a supplement for analgesia during labor. Morphine is the drug of choice in relieving pain of myocardial infarction. It may be used in veterinary care as an analgesic (narcotic), preanesthetic, antitussive, and antiperstaltic. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Morphine sulfate misuse is essentially observed among regular heroin injectors. The most serious adverse effect of morphine is respiratory depression. Constipation is a common side effect.

However, specific CNS opiate receptors have been identified and likely play a role in the expression of analgesic effects. Morphine first acts on the mu-opioid receptors. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.

Alcohol induced significant LORR in wild-type mice; this was halved by MyD88 and TLR4 deficiency, and surprisingly nearly completely eliminated by TLR2 deficiency. In contrast, the interaction between morphine and alcohol was found to be MOR-, NF-kappaB-, TLR2- and MyD88-dependent, but did not involve TLR4 or Interleukin-1beta. Morphine-alcohol interactions caused acute elevations in microglial cell counts and NF-kappaB-p65 positive cells in the motor cortex in concordance with wild-type and TLR2 deficient mouse behavioral data, implicating neuroimmunopharmacological signaling as a pivotal mechanism in this clinically problematic drug-drug interaction.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of morphine and alcohol with immune signaling pathways, specifically highlighting the roles of TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, and MOR. It details how genetic deficiencies in these targets affect alcohol-induced sedation and neuroinflammatory responses in mice, emphasizing neuroimmunopharmacological signaling's importance in drug-drug interactions.

This Henry's Law constant indicates that morphine is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water and moist soil surfaces(2). A pKa of 8.21(3) indicates morphine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Morphine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.7X10-9 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2).\n\n(1) Meylan WM, Howard PH; Environ Toxicol Chem 10: 1283-93 (1991)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the environmental fate of morphine, specifically its volatility from water and soil surfaces.

To establish the plausibility of the 'the poppy seed defence' the concentrations of codeine, norcodeine, morphine, normorphine and thebaine (a potential marker for seed ingestion) in several varieties of poppy seeds from different countries were quantified by GC-MS. The country of origin of the seed specimen analyzed and the preparation of the seeds prior to their culinary use was found to influence the alkaloid concentration determined. The maximum morphine and codeine concentrations determined in the seeds were found to be 33.2 and 13.7 micrograms/g seed respectively.
