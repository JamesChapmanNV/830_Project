The major hallucinogenic alkaloid isolated from Psilocybe mushrooms (also known as Teonanacatl or \"magic mushrooms\"). It has a role as a hallucinogen, a fungal metabolite, a prodrug and a serotonergic agonist. It is a tryptamine alkaloid, a tertiary amino compound and an organic phosphate. It is functionally related to a psilocin. It is a conjugate acid of a psilocybin(1-).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed chemical data on psilocybin, including identifiers, structure images, safety information, molecular formula and weight, and a comprehensive description of its chemical nature, biological roles, and pharmacological relevance. It is a focused summary within the full PubChem profile, essential for precise search retrieval of psilocybin's chemical and safety characteristics.\n                "}
