It is somewhat frequently found in pills sold as MDMA. Likewise, material sold as MDA is somewhat frequently actually MDMA. Following are approximate dosages in mg. Some people are more sensitive to MDA than others. Be careful if you are using MDA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength. There is some disagreement about whether MDA is more potent than MDMA (requiring lower doses), or if they are similarly potent. This is complicated by the fact that most people are not using lab verified materials. Erowid's current view is that the required dose of MDA vs MDMA are very similar, but result in slightly different effects (MDA is more physically stimulating while MDMA is more empathogenic at the same dose).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed dosage information for MDA, including typical dose ranges, onset, duration, and effects, sourced from Erowid.
