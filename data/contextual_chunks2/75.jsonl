The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\n\nFentanyl's strong potency compared to that of morphine is mainly due to its high lipophilicity (the ability of a chemical compound to dissolve in fats, oils, and lipids). Because of this, it can more easily penetrate the central nervous system in comparison to other opioids.\n\nSubjective effects\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the pharmacology section explains how fentanyl's structure and high lipophilicity contribute to its potent recreational effects, including euphoria, pain relief, and anxiolysis, providing foundational understanding of its mechanism of action and subjective experiences detailed later in the document.\n                "}
