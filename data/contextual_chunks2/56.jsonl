It is a potent analgesic. Opioid analgesics exert their principal pharmacologic effects on the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Opioids produce respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAdjuvants, Anesthesia\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information on oxymorphone's pharmacology, including its pharmacodynamics and classification as an opioid analgesic and anesthetic adjuvant, supplementing the comprehensive chemical and safety data in the full webpage.

These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Also, it has been shown that oxymorphone binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons via mu-receptors. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on oxymorphone's pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action, including its biological half-life of approximately 1.3 hours and its interaction primarily with opioid mu-receptors in the central nervous system. It explains how oxymorphone's binding sites are distributed in the brain and spinal cord, and how it inhibits GABA interneurons to modulate pain pathways, highlighting its role as a potent opioid analgesic. These data are essential for understanding the drug's duration of effect and pharmacological impact.\n                "}

These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Also, it has been shown that oxymorphone binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons via mu-receptors. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream.\n\n12.1.2 Drug Induced Liver Injury\n\nCompound\n\noxymorphone\n\nDILI Annotation\n\nNo-DILI-Concern\n\nLabel Section\n\nNo match\n\nReferences\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed toxicological information on oxymorphone, including its primary mechanism of action on opioid mu-receptors in the brain and spinal cord, and notes that it is not associated with drug-induced liver injury.

Maternal use of oral opioids during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, which may progress to rare but severe central nervous system depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics.[1] If oxymorphone is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral oxymorphone for 2 to 3 days at low dosages, with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately. Other agents are preferred over oxymorphone during breastfeeding.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on oxymorphone's effects during pregnancy and lactation, highlighting the lack of specific data on breastfeeding use and advising caution due to infant sensitivity.
