NO Tested for in Extended Drug Tests ? YES Possible to Test for? YES Detection Period in Urine 1-10 days\n\nTEST TYPES #\n\nUrine Testing\n\nMethadone does not show up in a basic opiate test that is part of the standard pre-employment drug test and which can detect heroin, codeine and morphine (and perhaps oxycodone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone). A methadone specific test must be performed to detect methadone. This test is not uncommon and is part of the second tier \"extended\" test done by many companies. Though the published information we've found suggests that methadone is not detectable after a few days, we have received reports from methadone maintenance users that they have been found methadone-positive on urine screens for 10-30 days after their last dose.\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides a summary of drug testing detection for methadone, highlighting whether it appears in standard and extended drug tests, detection windows in urine, and related testing methods. It is relevant within the broader drugs and chemicals index, offering key information for understanding methadone's test detectability and practical considerations for drug screening.\n                "}
