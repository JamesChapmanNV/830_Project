The slang name \"molly\" is traditionally used to refer to pure MDMA. However, other chemicals such as ethylone, methylone, and MDPV are often sold as \"molly\".\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of MDMA, including its common and brand names, classification effects, chemical name, description, and cautions about impurity.
