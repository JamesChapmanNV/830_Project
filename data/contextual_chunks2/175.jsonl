Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). MDMA and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination.\n\nDangerous Interaction: Protease Inhibitors.

MDMA use can lead to hyperthermia (overheating) especially in those who are exerting themselves for long periods of time. It is important for users to pay attention to their bodies and make sure they aren't overheating. Take breaks from dancing. Step outside for a moment if the temperature in the room is high. Make sure to drink enough, but not too much, water.\n\nIndividual sensitivity varies widely. A small percentage of users seem to react with extreme sensitivity to MDMA and experience overly strong effects at normal doses, including hyponatremia, unconsciousness, seizures, and other serious medical problems.\n\nStimulant combinations can be dangerous.

Avoid other strong stimulants in combination with MDMA, which can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature risks.\n\nWater Poisoning. Some ecstasy users overreact to the overheating and dehydration issue by obsessively over-drinking. When drinking large amounts of water it's important to mix in sports drinks or salty snacks to avoid the very real dangers of water poisoning and hyponatremia (low salt), which can cause serious health problems including death. MDMA can cause changes in the body's antidiuretic hormone, leading to much higher susceptibility to hyponatremia. Drink water, but don't drink too much.\n\nSeizures. A small number of MDMA users have reportedly had seizures after taking moderate amount of pure MDMA, more common in smaller women and with higher doses.

Individuals with a history of heart ailments, high blood pressure, aneurism or stroke, glaucoma, hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) disorders, or hypoglycemia may be at higher risk.\n\nHyponatremia. Some users seem particularly sensitive to MDMA's effects on the antidiuretic hormone (ADH, aka Vasopressin) which can lead to serious or even fatal hyponatremia, even without ingesting too much water. See References Search: MDMA & hyponatremia.\n\nNeurotoxicity Risk of long term changes to serotonin increases with dose and frequency of use.

Tablets of street \"ecstasy\" frequently contain an assortment of psychoactive substances, either mixed with MDMA, or in place of it, or may contain no active ingredients at all. Other substances found in street ecstasy include MDA, MDE, PMA, caffeine, ephedrine, amphetamines, DXM, and occasionally DOB. Caffeine, ephedrine, and amphetamines will produce less empathic effects than MDMA with more stimulation and feelings of restlessness. MDA and MDE are both similar in effects to MDMA and it may be difficult for even experienced users to distinguish between them. MDE is slightly shorter in duration than MDMA and generally has a lower peak and less euphoria than MDMA. MDA lasts longer and generally produces more visuals and psychedelic effects than MDMA.
