Other CYP enzymes contributing to MDMA metabolism are CYP3A4 and COMT. MDMA is metabolized via two primary metabolic pathways. It may undergo O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation. In contrast, it may also undergo N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. Due to autoinhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2D8, MDMA displays a complex, nonlinear pharmacokinetics profile, with the zeroth order kinetics occurring at higher doses. It is thought that this can result in sustained and higher concentrations of MDMA if the user takes consecutive doses of the drug.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on the metabolism and metabolic pathways of MDMA, highlighting key enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and COMT, and describing the primary metabolic processes such as O-demethylenation, methylation, N-dealkylation, and oxidation.

Once inside, MDMA inhibits the vesicular monoamine transporter, which results in increased concentrations of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine into the cytoplasm, and induces their release by reversing their respective transporters through a process known as phosphorylation. It also acts as a weak 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor agonist. MDMA's unusual entactogenic effects have been hypothesized to be, at least partly, the result of indirect oxytocin secretion via activation of the serotonin system. Oxytocin is a hormone released following events like hugging, orgasm, and childbirth, and is thought to facilitate bonding and the establishment of trust. Based on studies in rats, MDMA is believed to cause the release of oxytocin, at least in part, by both directly and indirectly agonizing the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from PMID:2083146 provides detailed information on MDMA's mechanism of action, highlighting how it enters neurons via monoamine transporters, increases neurotransmitter concentrations, and acts as a weak serotonin receptor agonist.

Safrole is the key starting material in so far as the other three can be synthesised from it. In the original Merck patent of 1914, safrole was reacted with hydrobromic acid to form bromosafrole, which was converted to MDMA using methylamine. Many illicit syntheses start with PMK and use either the Leuckart route or various reductive aminations including the aluminium foil method. All of these methods produce racemic MDMA.\n\nEuropean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA); Drug Profiles: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy').

Ecstasy is the popular name for the illicit drug MDMA and is widely used at dance parties. It is usually consumed orally in tablet or capsule form. MDMA acts as both a stimulant and psychedelic, producing an energizing effect, as well as distortions in time and perception and enhanced enjoyment from tactile experiences. HUMAN STUDIES: Acute toxic effects of MDMA include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, metabolic acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and rhabdomyolysis. These effects can lead to multiorgan failure and death. The level of hyperthermia predicts the potential for survival. MDMA produces cardiovascular effects similar to those seen with methamphetamine, including an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Serious sequelae can occur from electrolyte abnormalities seen in MDMA abuse and overdose.
