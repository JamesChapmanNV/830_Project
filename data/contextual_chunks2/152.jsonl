In the last couple years ketamine has become more widely known in the popular media and some testing companies have added it to their \"Club Drug\" testing battery. Unless there is a particular reason to be looking for it, as in the case of an autopsy, specific ketamine tests are not normally conducted. It is not one of the SAMHSA-5 standardly tested for in the basic drug test, nor is it included in the extended drug tests. If testing for ketamine is specifically requested, according to Ketamine: Dreams and Realities, norketamine, the breakdown product of ketamine, is detectable in both blood and urine for 7-14 days and possibly longer in heavy users. As of 2013, extended panel lab tests are now including ketamine in some areas.\n\nFALSE POSITIVES #\n\nSubstances or Conditions which can cause false positives\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the urine testing methods for ketamine, including detectability in different biological samples, commonality of tests, and potential for false positives.

Detection periods depend on amount and frequency of use, metabolic rate, body mass, age, overall health, drug tolerance, and urine pH of each individual.
