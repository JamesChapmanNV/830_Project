The literature gives conflicting reports, due to the fact that many criteria are subjective, and probably also due to confusion over terminology. The pharmacological effects of methamphetamine are very similar to those of similarly structured molecules.\n\nAdministration\n\nMethamphetamine can be taken orally, snorted, smoked or injected, in approximately increasing order of immediacy of onset.\n\nOnset\n\nOnset can be immediate (in the case of injection), or can take as long as 30-40 minutes if ingested orally.\n\nDuration\n\nDuration is subjective, but is probably on the order of 4 - 8 hours. Delayed absorption (for example, due to oral ingestion) can prolong the effects relative to time of administration. Of course, larger doses last longer due to the fact that it is removed from the blood at a finite rate.\n\nPlasma Life\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides an overview of methamphetamine's pharmacology, including its subjective effects, routes of administration, onset, duration, and plasma lifespan.

Hydroiodic acid works as a reducing agent because its dissociates at higher temperatures to iodine and hydrogen, which does the reducing. The dissociation is reversible. The equilibrium is shifted in favor of dissociation by adding red phosphorus to the mixture. The red phosphorus reacts with the iodine to produce PI3, which then further reacts with water to form phosphorus acid and more hydroiodic acid.

I would think that so long as one is over 3 molar acid, the reaction will work.

Of course, this assumes you have amphetamine in the first place, but let's just pretend you have some and you want to spice it up a bit. The difference between amphetamine and methamphetamine is the addition of a single methyl group (CH3) to the amino group sticking off the middle carbon atom in the chain. Fortunately, substituting amines is really simple. Vaporize your amine (your amphetamine) with a bunch of vaporized chloromethane (CH3Cl, a solvent) and some gaseous pyridine... voila, the amino group takes the methyl from the chloromethane and lets a hydrogen go. The hydrogen joins the liberated chlorine, and the resulting HCl is soaked up by the pyridine. The pyridine is optional. Adding it drives the reaction a bit by pulling the excess HCl out of the equation, but it's not necessary.\n\nMethylamine\n\nFrom: dnaugler@sfu.ca (David Naugler)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains a chemical synthesis method for converting amphetamine to methamphetamine by methylation using vaporized chloromethane and pyridine, highlighting a straightforward amine substitution process.
