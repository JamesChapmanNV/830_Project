It is a chromatographic absorbent device in which drug or drug metabolites in a sample compete with drug conjugate immobilized on a porous membrane for a limited number of binding sites. This test is a rapid, qualitative immunoassay for the detection of amphetamine in urine. The cutoff concentration for this test is 1000 ng/ml, as recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and NIDA.\" The cutoff for GC-MS, which detects d-amphetamine and methamphetamine, is 500 ng/ml.\n\nHair Testing\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information about drug testing methods for amphetamines, including urine and hair tests, detection periods, and cutoff levels, crucial for understanding how methamphetamine can be identified in various testing scenarios within the broader context of drug testing and psychoactive substance regulation.\n                "}
