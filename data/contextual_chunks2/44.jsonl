It started being used for veterinary purposes in Belgium and in 1964 was proven that compared to PCP, it produced minor hallucinogenic effects and shorter psychotomimetic effects. It was FDA approved in 1970, and from there, it has been used as an anesthetic for children or patients undergoing minor surgeries but mainly for veterinary purposes.\n\nKetamine is a General Anesthetic.

If skeletal muscle relaxation is needed, it should be combined with a muscle relaxant. If the surgical procedure involves visceral pain, it should be supplemented with an agent that obtunds visceral pain. Ketamine can be used for induction of anesthesia prior other general anesthetic agents and as a supplement of low potency agents.

Ketamine also has major abuse potential and is used illicitly as a recreational drug. Long term ketamine use can cause inflammation and irritation to the urinary bladder and urethra, and similar changes have recently been described in the biliary tract, resulting in an acute or chronic cholestatic liver injury that can resemble sclerosing cholangitis.\n\n7.3 Drug Classes\n\nBreast Feeding; Lactation; Milk, Human; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Anesthetics, Dissociative; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists\n\n7.4 WHO Essential Medicines\n\nDrug\n\nDrug Classes\n\nFormulation\n\nIndication\n\nDrug\n\nKetamine\n\nDrug Classes\n\nGeneral anaesthetics and oxygen > Injectable medicines\n\nFormulation\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides an overview of ketamine's liver-related safety profile from the FDA LiverTox summary, highlighting its use as a short-term general anesthetic, potential for psychological side effects, abuse potential, and risks of liver and biliary injury.

However, significant side effects limit its routine use. Ketamine rapidly produces a hypnotic state quite distinct from that of other anesthetics. Patients have profound analgesia, unresponsiveness to commands, and amnesia, but may have their eyes open, move their limbs involuntarily, and breathe spontaneously. This cataleptic state has been termed dissociative anesthesia. The administration of ketamine has been shown to reduce the development of tolerance to long-term opioid use.

Ketamine hydrochloride injection, USP is indicated as the sole anesthetic agent for diagnostic and surgical procedures that do not require skeletal muscle relaxation. HUMAN STUDIES: Ketamine is a unique anesthetic because it has both hypnotic and analgesic effects and also potential hallucinogenic side effects. Lack of cardiopulmonary depression makes the drug a popular choice for anesthesia in the prehospital setting. In recent years ketamine has been found to have anti-hyperalgesic and opioid saving effects, opening to new ways of managing post-operative and chronic pain states. Ketamine has been used as a drug of abuse. Ketamine produces a variety of symptoms including, but not limited to, anxiety, dysphoria, disorientation, insomnia, flashbacks, hallucinations, and psychotic episodes.

Available data indicate that ketamine use in nursing mothers may not affect the breastfed infant or lactation. Until more data are available, ketamine should be used with careful infant monitoring of the infant for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.\n\n◉ Effects in Breastfed Infants\n\nFour mothers who received epidural analgesia with lidocaine and bupivacaine for cesarean section also received general anesthesia with ketamine and midazolam (dosages not specified). Their infants were either breastfed or received their mother's breastmilk by bottle. No adverse effects were reported in the infants.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from section 12.1.6 provides detailed information on ketamine's effects during pregnancy and lactation, including safety data for breastfeeding and infants.

The results confirm that the administration of ketamine produces oculomotor performance deficits similar in part to those seen in schizophrenia. The atypical antipsychotic risperidone did not reverse ketamine-induced deteriorations. These findings do not support the cognitive enhancing potential of risperidone on oculomotor biomarkers in this model system of schizophrenia and point towards the importance of developing alternative performance-enhancing compounds to optimize pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the full webpage discusses research on ketamine's effects on oculomotor performance related to schizophrenia models, highlighting that ketamine impairs eye movement metrics (PS and AS) without significant interactions with risperidone, an antipsychotic. It emphasizes that risperidone does not reverse ketamine-induced deficits, informing understanding of ketamine's cognitive effects and treatment implications for schizophrenia.\n                "}

Blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in monkeys can abolish neural signals related to figure-ground segregation and feature integration. However, it is unknown whether this also affects perceptual integration itself. Therefore, we tested whether ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, reduces feature integration in humans. We administered a subanesthetic dose of ketamine to healthy subjects who performed a texture discrimination task in a placebo-controlled double blind within-subject design. We found that ketamine significantly impaired performance on the texture discrimination task compared to the placebo condition, while performance on a control fixation task was much less impaired.
