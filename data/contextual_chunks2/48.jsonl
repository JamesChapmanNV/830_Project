As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action. Due to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.

Like many basic drugs, methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non-immunological mechanism leading to flushing, pruritus, and urticaria, which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction. Compared to other opioids, methadone has fewer active metabolites and therefore a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity. This means that higher doses needed to manage severe pain or addiction are less likely to result in delirium, hyperalgesia, or seizures.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Methadone is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Methadone absorb at a maximum wavelength 295 nm(3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). In wastewater treatment systems, the abiotic transformation rate of methadone under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was 0.25 and 0.15/day, respectively(4).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the environmental fate of methadone, specifically its abiotic degradation pathways.
