It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers. The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976. During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a historical overview of amphetamine's discovery, medical use, and regulatory history, highlighting its chemical structure, early synthesis, and wartime application, which are key for understanding its pharmacology, legal status, and potential for abuse detailed throughout the full webpage.

ADHD is a complex disorder associated with the substantial heterogeneity in etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment outcome. ADHD comes from a complex interplay between interdependent genetic and non-genetic factors which cause complex mental disorders in children and teenagers. On the other hand, narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder typically resenting during adolescence and characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.

Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found. Once inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces other monoamines to be stored by VMAT2 which produces the pumping of the neurotransmitters into the synapse by a process called retro-transport.

Analysis of street samples suggests that amphetamines may be present in as little as 60% of purported samples. These illicit drugs contain varying amt of phencyclidine, LSD, STP, cocaine, atropine, mescaline, strychnine, and adulterants (eg, cornstarch, maltose, lactose, magnesium silicate, quinine, fibrous material).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the impurities and by-products generated during the illicit synthesis of dl-amphetamine, highlighting common contaminants and adulterants found in street samples.

Amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, & mescaline were acetylated with trifluoracetic anhydride in the presence of mercuric trifluoracetate as a catalyst.

Slightly varying procedures were used, depending on whether the drugs were in solid form or were obtained in organic fluids such as urine. Samples were analyzed on a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with an electron impact source.
