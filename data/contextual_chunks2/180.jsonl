Although this was a small controversy in the early 2000's, you can read our more recent understanding of this issue in Ask Erowid . 1912 MDMA first synthesized by Anton Köllisch and patented by Merck Pharmaceuticals in Germany.

However at the time of the original MDMA patent, Merck was a single company. 1927 Merck chemist Max Oberlin conducts the first animal testing with MDMA while investigating 'adrenaline- or ephetonine-like' substances. 3 1953 The Army Chemical Center studied MDMA toxicity by giving MDMA to guinea pigs, rats, mice, monkeys, and dogs.  It is determined to be less toxic than MDA. 4 1965 Alexander Shulgin synthesizes MDMA but does not yet try it. 5 1967-1970 The first small underground batches of MDMA are synthesized. Some, but relatively few individuals have tried it at this point. 6 [Details] Erowid does not currently have clear documentation about when the first recreational use of MDMA occurred.

As with MDA, MDMA (chemically properly N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyphenylisopropylamine or 1-(3 ,4- methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)-propane) has the aromatic substitution pattern of the essential oil safrole (6) from which it was first synthesized in 1960 (Ref. 8).
