It was the best selling minor tranquilizer for a time but has largely been replaced by benzodiazepines. Meprobamate has most of the pharmacological effects and dangers of the barbiturates (though it was marketed as being safer) but it is less sedating at effective doses. Meprobamate exhibits some anticonvulsant effects in absence seizures; however, it is reported to potentially exacerbate generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It has also been used as a hypnotic (sleeping pill).

Meprobamate can induce liver microsomal enzymes and thus may at least theoretically alter the metabolism of other drugs such as warfarin. There is some evidence that meprobamate may accelerate its own metabolism. Meprobamate metabolites are inactive and include 2B-hydroxymeprobamate, and glucosyluronide and glucuronide conjugates of meprobamate. These metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. About 10-12% of a dose of meprobamate is excreted in urine as unchanged drug within 24 hr. The remainder is excreted in urine as metabolites.\n\nAmerican Society of Health System Pharmacists; AHFS Drug Information 2009. Bethesda, MD.

While instances of clinically apparent liver injury due to meprobamate have been mentioned in review articles, no cases with specific information on clinical features have appeared in the published literature. Thus, meprobamate may be capable of causing clinically apparent liver injury, but it must be rare. Meprobamate is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system and has major potential for drug-drug interactions. Meprobamate can exacerbate symptoms of porphyria. Serious allergic reactions to meprobamate have been reported including Stevens Johnson syndrome. In cases of meprobamate overdose, the cause of death has been respiratory suppression and not liver failure, although liver histology was not well defined.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed information on the hepatotoxicity and liver-related safety profile of meprobamate, including the rarity of clinical liver injury, its metabolism via cytochrome P450, and potential for drug interactions and allergic reactions.
