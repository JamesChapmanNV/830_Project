General\n\nMDMA (also commonly known as Ecstacy, X, E, XTC, Adam, etc.) is a semi-synthetic chemical compound. In its pure form, it is a white crystalline powder. It usually seen in capsule form, in pressed pills, or as loose powder. Average cost ranges from $10-$30 (U.S.) a dose. Common routes of administration are swallowing or snorting, although it can be smoked or injected as well. Currently, MDMA is on the U.S. Schedule I of controlled substances, and is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell in the United States. Most other countries have similar laws. According to Nicholas Saunders (1993), \"MDMA was patented as long ago as 1913 by the German company Merck. [...] The patent doesn't mention uses.\" See PIHKAL (Shulgin & Shulgin 1991) or Shulgin 1986 for more history, including how Alexander Shulgin brought the drug to the attention of psychotherapists in the 1970s.\n\nDosing:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides an overview of MDMA in the \"General\" vault, including its chemical nature, common forms, typical dosages, routes of administration, legal status, and brief historical background.

Response to the drug is not strictly proportional to body weight. When MDMA is taken by mouth, the effects manifest about 30-45 minutes later; snorting, smoking or injecting produces much quicker onset. The primary effects usually reach a plateau at T+1:00 (one hour after taking the dose) to T+1:30, stay there for some two hours, then start tapering gradually. The primary effects are pretty much over by T+4:00 to T+6:00. Secondary effects (afterglow) may be felt for days, and tertiary psychological effects (e.g. improved outlook) may last indefinitely.

The same warning applies to people who are hypersensitive to drugs. Liver or kidney problems may also contraindicate MDMA use. It is, of course, desirable to hear from your physician that you're in good overall health before ingesting any powerful substance. Deaths have been reported of some MDMA users who were also taking Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs are often prescribed as antidepressants). MDMA is *not* recommended to anyone taking any MAOI.

The euphoria that it induces can make it easy to ignore bodily distress signals, so be watchful for things like dehydration (drink lots of water or fruit juices!), muscle cramping, dizziness, exhaustion or overexertion.

Thus a conservative, prudent assumption is that the risk of some kind of subtle neurological \"damage\" in humans from MDMA use is not zero. Yet there is no behavioral evidence of neurological harm in humans (and there is considerable evidence of psychological benefits) - this in many years of legal use (before 1985 in the US), and quite widespread illegal use since then. Given any non-zero risk, it makes sense to examine the benefit side of the equation, and take the drug only when you expect to get some tangible positive outcome from it that you feel makes taking the risk worthwhile.\n\nIV.

MDMA (\"Ecstasy\") is a semi-synthetic compound which can be made relatively easily from available precursors. Synthesis instructions exist which can be followed by an amateur with very little knowledge of chemistry. However, people with less than 2 years of college chemistry experience would probably not be capable of sucessfully synthesizing MDMA, and would either botch it in the best case or kill themselves in the worst case.

To get MDP-2-P first a natural source of safrole is acquired. Safrole can be extracted from sassafras oil, nutmeg oil, or several other sources which have been abundantly documented in _Chemical Abstracts_ over the years. The safrole is then easily isomerized into isosafrole when heated with NaOH or KOH. The isosafrole is then oxidized into MDP-2-P. This latter procedure has been most clearly presented in _Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved_ by Alexander Shulgin under synthesis #109 (MDMA). The synthesis of MDP-2-P from isosafrole will require the use of a vacuum pump to evaporate the solvent from the final product in vacuo. An aspirator will not, unfortunately, be sufficient.

The Raney Ni synthesis is more dangerous and requires special equipment to be done right (although this scheme is used in a significant number of clandestine labs). The sodium borohydride requires harsher conditions for the chemicals (ie. reflux) than sodium cyanoborohydride or aluminum amalgam and produces lower yields. The Leukart reaction is 2-step with lower yields and requires chemical apparatus. There are also two synthetic methods which proceed directly from safrole rather than through isosafrole. The first is the Ritter reaction which goes through the intermediate N-acetyl-MDA. The Ritter reaction is time-consuming, requires a degree of laboratory skill and produces poor yields. The other method uses HBr to produce 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-bromopropane which is then converted into MDA or MDMA.
