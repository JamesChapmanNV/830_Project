Oral methamphetamine ingestion tends to lack rushing, has less euphoric effects, and tends to cause far less of a feeling of wanting to do it again than the other methods. Smoking and injecting methamphetamine are associated with stronger, more euphoric effects and these are more associated with compulsive / addictive user patterns.\n\nAddiction and Withdrawal\n\nUsers of large amount of amphetamines over a long period of time can develop an amphetamine psychosis, which is a mental disorder similar to paranoid schizophrenia. The psychosis is manifested by hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Bizarre, sometime violent, behavior is exhibited by those with amphetamine psychosis. Symptoms usually disappear within a few weeks after drug use stops.\n\nWithdrawal Symptoms\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the different routes of administration for methamphetamine and their effects, highlighting how usage methods influence euphoria and addiction potential.

These affect serotonin, the neurotransmitter in the brain that deals with both depression and drug craving. Sedatives such as Dalmane, chloral hydrate, Librium, phenobarbital, or even Valium are used, very carefully, on a short-term basis to treat anxiety or sleep disturbance problems. Antipsychotic medications such as Haldol, Thorazine, and others are also used to buffer the effects of unbalanced dopamine, the neurotransmitter that moderates paranoia and pleasurable sensation. In addition to treating the physical and psychological aspects of craving, treatment providers should stress group counseling and peer pressure for compulsive amphetamine users, as these forms of therapy work well for this population.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details common withdrawal symptoms from methamphetamine use, including sleep disturbances, increased hunger, and psychotic reactions, and describes medical treatment options such as antidepressants, sedatives, and antipsychotics.
