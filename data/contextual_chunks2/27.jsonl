Used to control a variety of fungal diseases on rice including blast, ear blight and stem rot. Edifenphos is moderately toxic to mammals and fish but poses more of a risk to aquatic invertebrates. It has a role as a neurotoxin, an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, a phospholipid biosynthesis inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical.\n\nSee also: Polyethylene Glycol (annotation moved to).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides a detailed snapshot of the chemical Edifenphos, including identifiers, molecular data, safety information, and a description of its chemical nature, uses, and toxicity.
