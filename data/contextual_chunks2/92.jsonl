NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually an almost identical equivalent of the notorious “k-hole.”\n\nUnlike ketamine, PCP also shows appreciable affinity for antagonizing the PCP2 glutamate receptor.[14] PCP also acts as a sigma-2 agonist and mild serotonin reuptake inhibitor.[15] It has also been characterized as a potent D2 dopamine agonist but not a dopamine reuptake inhibitor in humans.[16] This D2 dopamine agonism contributes to the infamous stimulation, euphoria, and mania of PCP.\n\nSubjective effects\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides an overview of PCP's pharmacological mechanisms, detailing its role as an NMDA receptor antagonist, its interactions with glutamate, sigma-2 receptors, serotonin, and dopamine receptors.
