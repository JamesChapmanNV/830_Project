Pregabalin is a common prescription drug, which is typically used to treat neuropathic pain, anxiety, restless leg syndrome, and as an adjunct drug in the treatment of seizures.[3][4]\n\n                    Text: \n                    Interactions\n\nOne report of a patient entering serotonin syndrome following perioperative Oxycodone and pregabalin exists.[42] However, several studies have failed to find any serotonergic effect whatsoever from pregabalin. One paper states, \"Although pregabalin is a structural analog of GABA, it has no clinically significant effects at GABA-A or GABA-B receptors, and it is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist. Pregabalin is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and does not act as a glutamate receptor antagonist.\"[43] A more recent study writes that \"Pregabalin has no involvement with serotonin and dopamine receptors and does not inhibit dopamine, serotonin, or noradrenaline reuptake.\"[44] Pregabalin's main mechanism of action is binding and blocking sub receptor on Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels, leading to a downstream reduction of overactive neurons.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section clarifies pregabalin's pharmacological interactions by emphasizing its lack of serotonergic activity and minimal involvement with serotonin or dopamine receptors. It addresses concerns about serotonin syndrome reports and highlights that pregabalin primarily acts on voltage-gated calcium channels, making it relevant for understanding its safety profile and drug interactions within the broader discussion of toxicity, harm potential, and mechanisms of action.\n                "}
