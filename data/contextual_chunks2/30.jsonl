A semi-synthetic drug, it is a centrally acting pain medication of the opioid class. It has a role as an opioid analgesic and a mu-opioid receptor agonist. It is a morphinane alkaloid and an organic heteropentacyclic compound. It derives from a hydride of a morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides a concise overview of hydromorphone, including its PubChem CID, structural images, safety classifications, chemical formulas, synonyms, molecular weight, key dates, and a brief chemical description.

Structurally, hydromorphone derived from [morphine] in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound. Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential). The first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nHydromorphone Hydrochloride (has salt form).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\nHydromorphone.png\n\n1.2 3D Conformer\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed chemical and structural information about hydromorphone, including its derivation from morphine, key modifications, potency, classification as a Schedule II opioid, and historical clinical availability since 1920.

Due to its addictive potential and overdose risk, hydromorphone is only prescribed when other first-line treatments have failed. The WHO has proposed a three-step ladder for the management of pain in which it is suggested to start with a non-opioid medication followed by addition of weak opioids to the non-opioid treatment for moderate pain and finishing in the use of strong opioids such as hydromorphone along with the existing regimen for cases of severe pain. Off-label, hydromorphone can be administered for the suppression of refractory cough.\n\nFDA Label\n\n7.2 Drug Classes\n\nBreast Feeding; Lactation; Milk, Human; Analgesics, Opioid; Narcotics; Antitussive Agents; Opiates\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed information on hydromorphone’s drug indications, classification, and related data, including its use for moderate to severe pain, off-label cough suppression, and relevant drug classes like opioids and narcotics.

These safety risks are potentially harmful interactions with numerous other medications, problems with the adrenal glands, and decreased sex hormone levels. We are requiring changes to the labels of all opioid drugs to warn about these risks. Opioids can interact with antidepressants and migraine medicines to cause a serious central nervous system reaction called serotonin syndrome, in which high levels of the chemical serotonin build up in the brain and cause toxicity. Taking opioids may lead to a rare, but serious condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol helps the body respond to stress. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as reduced interest in sex, impotence, or infertility.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from section 7.8 provides FDA-mandated warning information regarding safety risks associated with opioid medications, including interactions, hormonal effects, and adverse reactions.

Its analgesic effect is suggested to be related to the effect on the mu-opioid receptors. It has been reported to also have a minor affinity for the delta and kappa receptor. On the other hand, it is known to act at the level of the medulla which allows it to depress the respiratory drive and suppress cough. The onset of action of the immediate release form of hydromorphone is achieved in 15-20 minutes and having a lasting effect for 3-4 hours while the extended-release form onset of action is of 6 hours lasting for about 13 hours.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed pharmacological information on hydromorphone's mechanism of action, including its opioid receptor binding profile, effects on respiratory drive and cough suppression, and onset and duration of both immediate and extended-release formulations. It is relevant for understanding hydromorphone’s analgesic properties and pharmacokinetics within the comprehensive resource of the full document.

In general, Maternal use of oral opioids during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, which may progress to rare but severe central nervous system depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. If hydromorphone is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of hydromorphone to 2 to 3 days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring.[1] If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes hydromorphone’s use during lactation, highlighting its excretion into breast milk, potential neonatal risks such as CNS depression, and recommendations for maternal use and infant monitoring.
