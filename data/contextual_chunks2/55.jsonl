Some infants exposed at this time exhibit either the floppy infant syndrome or marked neonatal withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms vary from mild sedation, hypotonia, and reluctance to suck, to apneic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. These symptoms have been reported to persist for periods from hours to months after birth. This correlates well with the pharmacokinetic and placental transfer of the benzodiazepines and their disposition in the neonate. /Benzodiazepines/\n\nDart, R.C. (ed). Medical Toxicology.

GABA receptors are ionotropic chloride-linked channel receptors that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. When activated by GABA, the GABA receptor/chloride ionophore complex undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. Benzodiazepines are believed to exert their effect by increasing the effect of GABA at its receptor. Benzodiazepine binding increases chloride conductance in the presence of GABA by increasing the frequency at which the channel opens. In contrast, barbiturates increase chloride conductance in the presence of GABA by prolonging the time in which the channel remains open. There are 18 subtypes of the GABA receptor subunits.

Death may occur before hospital arrival due to sedation (particularly if combined with other CNS depressants), but the course of patients reaching hospital is generally uncomplicated. The clinical effects of benzodiazepine poisoning are due entirely to CNS depression. Severe poisoning may occasionally develop hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Respiratory and CNS depression may lead to aspiration pneumonia. However, deep coma (GCS less than 8) is unusual. Most patients are stuporous or still responsive to painful stimuli unless they have coingested other sedating drugs. Ataxia and nystagmus are common in nontolerant patients, but if pronounced, the possibility of concomitant drug over dose should be raised (i.e., anticonvulsant). /Benzodiazepines/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information on the clinical presentation and neurological effects of benzodiazepine overdose, specifically emphasizing symptoms like CNS depression, responsiveness, and signs such as ataxia and nystagmus.
