It has a role as a neurotoxin, a psychotropic drug, a central nervous system stimulant, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of amphetamines and a secondary amine. It is functionally related to a (S)-amphetamine. It is a conjugate base of a methamphetamine(1+).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides essential chemical identifiers and properties of methamphetamine, including its CID, molecular formula, weight, synonyms, structural images, and descriptive role as a stimulant and neurotoxin.

The acute effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an epinephrine-provoked fight-or-flight response, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, vasoconstriction (constriction of the arterial walls), bronchodilation, and hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar). Users experience an increase in focus, increased mental alertness, and the elimination of fatigue, as well as a decrease in appetite.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAdrenergic Uptake Inhibitors\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed information on the pharmacological mechanisms of methamphetamine, specifically its pharmacodynamics and classification within adrenergic uptake inhibitors, as outlined in the full pharmacology and biochemistry sections of the document.

Following an intravenous dose, 45% is excreted as unchanged parent drug and 7% amphetamine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers pharmacokinetic aspects of methamphetamine, detailing its rapid absorption via gastrointestinal, intranasal, and inhalation routes, with peak concentrations within 3.13 to 6.3 hours.

Route of Elimination: Excretion occurs primarily in the urine, the rate of which is dependent on urine pH. Between 30-54% of an oral dose is excreted in urine as unchanged methamphetamine and 10-23% as unchanged amphetamine.

It may also slow down catecholamine metabolism by inhibiting monoamine oxidase. The toxic effects of methamphetamine on dopamine and serotonergic neurons have recently been linked to the endogenous formation of c-hydroxy dopamine and 5, 7 dihydrotryptamine, respectively. The ability of methamphetamine to both release dopamine and serotonin as well as to inhibit monoamine oxidase activity leads to the non-enzymatic oxidation of dopamine and serotonin. Methamphetamine induced neuronal damage is mediated by the production of free radicals. This drug causes a long lasting depletion of dopamine and serotonin in the striatum and that pre-treatment alteration of this effect by four different antioxidants, as well as an inhibitor of superoxidase dismutase, indicate that oxygen free radicals have a role in methamphetamine\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the pharmacological mechanism of methamphetamine in the central nervous system, highlighting its effect on releasing norepinephrine and dopamine, inhibiting monoamine oxidase, and causing neuronal damage via free radical production.

Rhabdomyolysis is an important consequence of severe amphetamine poisoning. Agitation, confusion, mood elevation, increased wakefulness, talkativeness, irritability and panic attacks are typical. Chronic abuse can cause delusions and paranoia. A withdrawal syndrome occurs after abrupt cessation following chronic use. The ability of methamphetamine to both release dopamine and serotonin as well as to inhibit monoamine oxidase activity leads to the non-enzymatic oxidation of dopamine and serotonin. Methamphetamine induced neuronal damage is mediated by the production of free radicals. This drug causes a long lasting depletion of dopamine and serotonin in the striatum and that pre-treatment alteration of this effect by four different antioxidants, as well as an inhibitor of superoxidase dismutase, indicate that oxygen free radicals have a role in methamphetamine- induced neurotoxicity.
