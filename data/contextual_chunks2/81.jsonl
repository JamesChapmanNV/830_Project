Normal cognition and working memory are impaired in a dose-dependent manner. However, the trade-off is that creative or non-linear thinking faculties may become enhanced (see conceptual thinking).\n\nAnxiety suppression - Anxiety suppression is notable at all doses but not as selective as the effect of benzodiazepines or other GABAergics.\n\nCognitive euphoria - Users report moderate to strong states of cognitive euphoria which tend to occur during the come-up phase; however, appears to be less pronounced compared to stimulants, entactogens, and opioids.\n\nCompulsive redosing - Due to its euphoric effects, rapid onset, and short duration, ketamine can cause compulsive re-dosing in some individuals.

Studies have shown[32][33] that the effect of the drug is immediate or within 2 hours and consistent in relieving a patient’s depressive and/or suicidal symptoms, lasting up to 3 days after a single dose. In comparison, common antidepressants such as fluoxetine (Prozac) can take weeks to show therapeutic effects.\n\nKetamine is a racemate composed of the R-(−)-ketamine enantiomer (arketamine) and the S-(+)-ketamine enantiomer (esketamine). Esketamine inhibits the reuptake of the dopamine transporter about 8-fold more potently than does arketamine, and so is about 8 times more potent as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.[34] Arketamine appears to be more effective as a rapid-acting antidepressant than esketamine.[35]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses ketamine's emerging role as a rapid-acting antidepressant, highlighting its effectiveness in treating chronic depression and bipolar disorder within hours of administration.
