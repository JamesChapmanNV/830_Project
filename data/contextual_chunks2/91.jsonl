Likewise, adverse effects become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include addiction, severe injury, or death ☠.\n\nPhysical effects\n\nSedation - Gabapentin is typically mildly sedating and can produce a lethargic state. At higher doses, it may lead to a moderately sedated state.\n\nAppetite enhancement - Appetite enhancement is not particularly prominent, but is sometimes reported. It can have a synergistic effect when combined with cannabis.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears within the \"Subjective effects\" section of the gabapentin page, providing a warning about the anecdotal nature of reported effects and potential risks.
