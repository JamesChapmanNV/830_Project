There's no finer intoxicant, but you need careful and considerable support or the body load can turn you into a vegetable for the latter half of the experience and the day after. With X you feel all the emotional and spiritual connectivy possible (much the 'empathogen'), with MDA you see (hallucinate, visually experience) all the emotional and spiritual connectivity possible.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is a detailed comparison of MDA and MDMA from the Erowid chemicals section, highlighting differences in duration, effects, and subjective experience, and emphasizing MDA's longer, more intense body load and hallucinogenic qualities relative to MDMA.\n                "}

Tactile sensation is more powerful, erotic and noticeable on MDA. Physical effects are more up-front: gastric upset, pupil dilation, water retention, limbic arousal. On the whole, we find MDA a more enjoyable and interesting trip; longer lasting and more sexual/sensual. Our favorite characteristic is that one retains an interesting psychedelic ideation on MDA, rather then the feeling-oriented, but rather idealess thinking of MDM(A).\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a comparative analysis of MDA and MDMA, highlighting their differences in effects, including hallucinations, aesthetics, emotional impact, and physical sensations.
