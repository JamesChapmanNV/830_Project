Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. The administration of narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. Be careful when combining hydrocodone with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, narcotics, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety agents.
