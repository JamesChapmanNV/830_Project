Other formulations are available.\n\nOral Oxycodone Dosages w/ no tolerance w/ some tolerance w/ heavy tolerance Light 2.5 - 5 mg 5 - 10 mg 20 - 40mg Common 5 - 10 mg 10 - 40 mg 50 - 150mg Strong 10 - 30 mg 30 - 60 mg 150 - 600mg Onset : 10 - 30 minutes Coming Up: 30 - 60 minutes Peak : 30 - 60 minutes Plateau : 2 - 4 hours Duration : 3 - 6 hours\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information on oxycodone dosage forms, including types like Percocet, Percodan, and Oxycontin, as well as specific oral dosage ranges for different tolerance levels, onsets, peak times, and durations.
