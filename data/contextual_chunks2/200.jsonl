This means they are illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription.

As most prosecutions happen at the state level it is important to be familiar with your state and local laws.\n\nINTERNATIONAL LAW #\n\nCanada #\n\nMorphine is schedule I in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules)\n\nPortugal #\n\nEffective July 2001, personal use of morphine without a prescription was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see text of law). Possession of less than 2 g is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment.
