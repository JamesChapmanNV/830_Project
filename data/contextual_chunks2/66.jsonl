While Zopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zopiclone binds selectively to the brain alpha subunit of the GABA A omega-1 receptor.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides the DEA Schedule IV classification for zopiclone, highlighting its low potential for abuse, and details its pharmacological profile, including its classification as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class. It explains zopiclone's mechanism of action involving interaction with the GABABZ receptor complex and its sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects, situating it within the broader pharmacology and safety information detailed throughout the document.\n                "}
