Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the formulation and pharmacological rationale of buprenorphine combined with naloxone in the product Suboxone, emphasizing its abuse-deterrent mechanism through poor oral absorption of naloxone and its role in opioid dependence treatment within the broader discussion of buprenorphine's pharmacology, clinical use, and safety profile.\n                "}

The binding to the mu and kappa receptors results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. Furthermore, buprenorphine slowly dissociates from its receptor.

Additional adverse effects of buprenorphine include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, memory loss, sweating, dry mouth, miosis, orthostatic hypotension, sexual adverse effects, and urinary retention.\n\nFollowing buprenorphine treatment, a patient's tolerance to opioids may diminish, posing a potential risk if they resume their previous opioid dosage. Therefore, patients must recognize their heightened sensitivity to low opioid doses and promptly inform their healthcare provider of any unusual symptoms. Moreover, patients should be strongly advised against using opioids without prior consultation with their healthcare provider.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from section 11.1.7-8 details the clinical symptoms and adverse effects associated with buprenorphine overdose and treatment, highlighting overdose manifestations such as pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression, as well as side effects like hypotension, QT prolongation, nausea, and drowsiness.
