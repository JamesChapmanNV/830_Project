A well-known effect of ketamine at higher-range doses is the \"K-hole\", where the user is removed from reality and set adrift in an introspective dream-like world, often involving complete dissociation, immersive visuals and out-of-body experiences. At higher doses, the user can be incapacitated and unresponsive, or uncoordinated and erratic, appearing unwell to the uninitiated eye. Nausea and vomiting may also be present. While ketamine is not known to be physically addictive, prolonged use could be tolerance-building as well as leading to psychological dependency.\n\nEXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the health risks associated with ketamine, specifically highlighting its depressant effects on heart rate and respiration, dosage considerations, and potential adverse experiences such as the \"K-hole\" and dependency issues.
