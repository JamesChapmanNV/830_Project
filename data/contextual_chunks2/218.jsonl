Forty-five percent of the entire inmate group clearly underwent a mystical, transcendent, death-rebirth experience. This figure should be modified, however. The results for running sessions improved so that 100% of our recent groups were undergoing transcendent experiences.\" The term 'moderate' must be read in the context where 100% of those moderate doses precipitated \"transcendent\" experiences.
