Flubromazepam is named for the fluorine and bromine substitutions on its core benzodiazepine skeleton (FLUorine-BROMine-azepam). Flubromazepam is a member of the benzodiazepine class as it contains a 1,4 diazepine ring fused to a substituted benzene ring. Bromine is bound to this bicyclic structure at R7. Additionally, a fluorine-substituted phenyl ring is bound to this structure at R5. Flubromazepam also contains an oxygen group double bonded to R2 of its diazepine ring to form a ketone.

This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as barbiturates and alcohol since they work similarly, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABAA receptor. Thus their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABAA receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer[13].
