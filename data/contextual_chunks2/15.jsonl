Groups dosed with DMA or MA showed adducts in both single- and multiple-dose groups, except for the single-dose DMA liver and urinary bladder samples, which were below the level of detection. No DNA adducts were detected in any of the white blood cell samples under either dosing regimen. The lido- and prilo-DNA adducts detected were chromatographically indistinguishable from those formed either in DMA- or MA-dosed rats, respectively, or by chemical reaction of the corresponding N-hydroxy derivatives with DNA. Thus, lido and prilo can generate DNA adducts in rats via their aromatic amine metabolites, although at lower levels than equal molar quantities of their amine metabolites.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the formation of DNA adducts from the metabolism of local anesthetics lidocaine (lido) and prilocaine (prilo), highlighting their potential genotoxicity via aromatic amine pathways. It reports detection of DNA adducts in rat tissues after repeated dosing, comparing levels to those from known metabolites DMA and MA, and emphasizes the chromatic similarity of adducts, which is relevant for understanding the carcinogenic risks associated with these drugs.\n                "}

DNA strand breaks were observed in a dose-dependent manner in AS52 cells when treated with each of the N-OH-2,6-DMA and 2,6-DMAP. Comparative evaluation of the results indicates that the principal mechanism of mutagenic action is likely to be through redox cycling of intracellularly bound aminophenol/quinone imine structures to generate ROS rather than through formation of covalent DNA adducts. These considerations do not rule out DNA adduct formation by monocyclic nitrenium ions because it has been established that the free nitrenium ion derived from 2,6-DMA can form under aqueous conditions.
