This occurs due to the way in which opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's euphoric, analgesic (pain relief), and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects.\n\nOxymorphone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic related to hydromorphone. It affects the central nervous system and smooth muscles by activation of specific opiate receptors. Hydromorphone and oxymorphone are semisynthetic derivatives of morphine and potent opiate agonists which are used predominantly to treat moderate-to-severe pain.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt explains the pharmacological mechanism of oxymorphone, detailing how it activates μ-opioid receptors to produce analgesic and euphoria effects.

When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of oxymorphone develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. Oxymorphone presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of oxymorphone all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the harm reduction advice, specifically emphasizing the addictive potential, dependence risks, and tolerance development associated with oxymorphone use, within the broader context of its pharmacology, dangers, and safety considerations outlined in the full drug profile.\n                "}

In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[7]\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nOxymorphone is dangerous to use in combination with other depressants as many fatalities reported as overdoses are caused by interactions with other depressant drugs like alcohol or benzodiazepines, resulting in dangerously high levels of respiratory depression.[8]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the increased overdose risk associated with opioid cessation and relapse due to reduced tolerance, highlighting environmental influences on overdose danger.
