Amphetamines generally cause strong physical and mental stimulation, keeping users awake and alert for many hours, and some amphetamines cause mood lift / euphoria. Because they increase wakefulness, various amphetamines have been used by the military, by pilots, truck drivers, and other workers to keep functioning past their normal limits. Amphetamines are also used to treat Attention Deficit Disorder and can have the seemingly paradoxical effect of quieting and calming users. Common amphetamines include Dexedrine (d-amphetamine), methamphetamine, and adderall (dl-amphetamine). Substantial amounts of pharmaceutical amphetamines are diverted from medical use to recreational and work-related uses and methamphetamine is produced in huge quantities in underground labs around the world.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of amphetamine, including its general effects, common forms, and primary uses, serving as an introductory summary within the broader Erowid drugs database. It highlights key information about amphetamine's stimulatory effects, medical applications, and prevalence in both medical and illicit markets, making it essential for understanding the substance's profile in the context of drug information.\n                "}

Amphetamine use grew rapidly when amphetamines were distributed to soldiers during World War II.
