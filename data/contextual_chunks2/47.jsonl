It is an analgesic which is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including postoperative pain and labour pain. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and an antispasmodic drug. It is an ethyl ester, a piperidinecarboxylate ester and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a pethidine(1+).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides key chemical identifiers, safety information, and detailed chemical descriptions of meperidine, including molecular formula, weight, structure, and pharmacological role as an opioid analgesic.

Meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than equivalent doses of morphine. The onset of action is lightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. The chemical structure of meperidine is similar to local anesthetics. Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from Martindale's Pharmacopoeia details the pharmacological properties, including pharmacodynamics, of meperidine, emphasizing its rapid onset, shorter duration compared to morphine, and its uses for moderate to severe pain, anesthesia, and postoperative chills. It is relevant within the full document as it provides critical scientific context on meperidine's mechanism of action and therapeutic applications, aiding comprehensive understanding of the drug's biochemical and pharmacological profile.\n                "}

The inhibitory effect of meperidine on Ca(2+) current could not be prevented by pretreatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. These data suggest that meperidine exerts a negative inotropic effect by inhibiting L-type Ca(2+) current. The lack of effect of naloxone implies that the action is independent of the opioid receptor.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the cardiac electrophysiology effects of meperidine, showing its ability to inhibit L-type calcium channels and reduce calcium transients independently of opioid receptor activity. It is relevant within the document's pharmacology section, illustrating meperidine's negative inotropic mechanism and its potential impact on cardiac function unrelated to its opioid activity.\n                "}

This study investigated the blocking effects of meperidine on different ionic currents of spinal dorsal horn neurons and, in particular, its impact on the generation of action potentials. Using a combination of the patch clamp technique and the entire soma isolation method, the action of meperidine on voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents in spinal dorsal horn neurons of rats was described.

Externally applied meperidine reversibly blocked voltage-gated Na+ currents with a half-maximum inhibiting concentration (IC50) of 112 uM. During repetitive stimulation, a slight phasic block occurred.

Meperidine is extracted with ether from plasma that has been made basic with sodium hydroxide. The ether extract is evaporated to dryness, and the residue is dissolved in carbon disulfide for GLC analysis. An internal standard, N',N'-diethylaminoacetyl-2,6-xylidine, is used to quantitate meperidine. The extraction efficiency from plasma is 85%, and as little as 0.05 microng of meperidine can be quantitatively determined in 1 mL of plasma.\n\nPMID:853375\n\nEvans MA, Harbison RD; J Pharm Sci 66: 599-600 (1977)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details analytical methods for measuring meperidine in biological fluids, including a gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GLC) procedure with an extraction efficiency of 85% and sensitivity to detect as little as 0.05 micrograms in plasma, as described by Evans and Harbison (1977).

Meperidine is a strong analgesic used in the relief of moderate to severe pain. The drug has been used to relieve the pain of myocardial infarction. Meperidine also is used parenterally for preoperative sedation, as a supplement to anesthesia, and to provide analgesia during labor. HUMAN STUDIES: Meperidine is a mu- and kappa-opiate receptor agonist with approximately 20-25% the potency of morphine. Receptors for opiate analgesics are found in high concentrations in the limbic system, spinal cord, thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum, and midbrain. They are also found in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, urinary track, and in other smooth muscle. Meperidine is different from other opioids because its active metabolite, normeperidine, is neurotoxic. The lethal meperidine blood concentration is 1-3 mg/dL. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting and hypotension. Meperidine can produce further hypotension in patients who have blood\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a comprehensive summary of meperidine's physical properties, medical uses, mechanism of action, and side effects, serving as a detailed core section within the full chemical and pharmacological profile documented in the full webpage.

Meperidine is reported to inhibit the release of gonadotropins in animals.

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex.

Maternal use of oral opioids during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, which may progress to rare but severe central nervous system depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. If meperidine is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of meperidine to 2 to 3 days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.4X10-7 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates meperidine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase meperidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. Particulate-phase meperidine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Meperidine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, meperidine is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1560.

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that meperidine is expected to have low mobility in soil. The pKa of meperidine is 8.68(3), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4).\n\n(1) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.
