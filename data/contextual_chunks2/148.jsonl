Many opiate tests test only for morphine (which both codeine and heroin break down into). This is true for both home/business kits and laboratory testing. Hydrocodone does not break down into morphine, and is therefore not detected by these tests. But home and laboratory testing is available that will detect hydrocodone (and hydromorphone, which it breaks down into). So test results will depend on the particular type of test that is used and whether or not laboratory verification is required. If a home drug test is given and the opiate test shows a positive result (due to hydromorphone use), a laboratory verification might NOT result in a positive test because the lab may only test for morphine. In this case, the lab would NOT be able to verify the original positive result.\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on urine drug testing for hydrocodone, explaining how standard tests may not detect it due to its breakdown pathway, the variability of detection depending on test type, and the importance of laboratory verification.
