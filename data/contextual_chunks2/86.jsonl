This phenyl ring is substituted at R3 with a hydroxy group (OH-). An additional hydroxy group is found at the same location the cyclohexane ring is bonded to at the phenyl ring, R1.

The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). O-DSMT presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of O-DSMT all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nWarning: Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances.
