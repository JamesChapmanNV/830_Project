It is legally prescribed as a treatment for ADD under the brand name Desoxyn, for both children and adults. On the street, it is generally found as an odorless, white or off-white, bitter-tasting powder, though it is also found in pills, capsules and larger crystals. It is frequently snorted, but is also used orally, smoked, and injected. Methamphetamine production is a relatively simple process, especially when compared to many other recreational drugs. It is frequently reported on in the media when home meth-producing labs are busted.\n\n[ Main Meth Vault ]\n\nDose #\n\nDose Summary Needed.\n\nPrice #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information about methamphetamine, including its physical description, legal status, methods of use, production, and effects, serving as a comprehensive overview within the larger drugs and chemicals database on the webpage.\n                "}

The HCl salt is smokable as is. Crystal meth \"Crystal Meth\" or \"Ice\" refer to methamphetamine grown into crystals. Though many people believe that Crystal Meth is the freebase form of methamphetamie HCl, this is not true. Methamphetamine is smokable in its normal HCL form, but taking the time to grow it into crystals makes it easier to smoke. Meth in visible crystals (rather than powder) is likely to be relatively pure as it is difficult to grow crystals from impure material.

This can be magnified by lack of sleep which often accompanies heavy use of meth. Methamphetamine is an anorexant, meaning it causes most people to lose interest in food.

Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). MAOIs and Methamphetamine are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI.\n\nIndividuals with heart disease (i.e. arteriosclerosis, hypertension) should be extremely careful as Methamphetamine use can cause increased demands on the heart.
