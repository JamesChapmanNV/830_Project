However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for \"night time\" use.

The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone. Such receptor sites may be found in the gut, uterus, large blood vessels, bronchial muscles, and elsewhere. Anti-emetic action is by inhibition at the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAntiemetics\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the pharmacological properties and classifications of diphenhydramine, including its anti-histaminic, anti-emetic, and anti-vertigo effects, as well as its mechanism of competing at H1 receptor sites and central actions.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 0.13 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Diphenhydramine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Diphenhydramine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).\n\n(1) Meylan WM, Howard PH; Chemosphere 26: 2293-99 (1993)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the environmental abiotic degradation pathways of diphenhydramine, including estimated vapor-phase reaction rates with hydroxyl radicals and its resistance to hydrolysis and direct photolysis under environmental conditions.
