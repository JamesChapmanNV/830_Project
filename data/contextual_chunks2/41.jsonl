A mu-opioid receptor antagonist, it is used to treat alcohol dependence. It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, a central nervous system depressant, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antidote to opioid poisoning. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a morphinane-like compound and a member of cyclopropanes. It is a conjugate base of a naltrexone(1+).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides key identifiers, molecular weight, and a detailed chemical description of naltrexone, including its structure as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist used for alcohol dependence treatment.

Naltrexone is indicated in the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the blockade of the effects of exogenously administered opioids. It markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of intravenously administered opioids. When co-administered with morphine, on a chronic basis, naltrexone blocks the physical dependence to morphine, heroin and other opioids. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, naltrexone will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAlcohol Deterrents\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes the pharmacological mechanisms and classification of naltrexone, highlighted in section 8 of the full document.

The mechanism of action of naltrexone in alcoholism is not understood; however, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone is thought to act as a competitive antagonist at mc, κ, and δ receptors in the CNS, with the highest affintiy for the μ receptor. Naltrexone competitively binds to such receptors and may block the effects of endogenous opioids. This leads to the antagonization of most of the subjective and objective effects of opiates, including respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, and drug craving. The major metabolite of naltrexone, 6-β-naltrexol, is also an opiate antagonist and may contribute to the antagonistic activity of the drug.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information on the mechanism of action of naltrexone as a pure opioid antagonist with minimal agonist activity, highlighting its competitive binding at µ, κ, and δ receptors in the CNS, and the role of its major metabolite, 6-β-naltrexol. It is relevant to the overall document by explaining the pharmacological basis of naltrexone's therapeutic effects, particularly in alcoholism treatment, and supports comprehensive drug mechanism data for search and retrieval purposes.\n                "}

In this article we introduce a reliable and simple method developed for the simultaneous determination of naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol in human serum by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Liquid-liquid extraction with butyl acetate from basic solutions (pH 9) was chosen for extraction with nalorphine as an internal standard (IS). Analytes were back-extracted from organic solvent into perchloric acid. The acid extract was chromatographed by HPLC with a reverse-phase ODS-column and electrochemical detector. The mobile phase was a NaH(2)PO(4)-solution with acetonitrile as an organic modifier and octanesulfonic acid and tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulfate as ion-pair reagents. The recovery of the extraction method was 48% for naltrexone and 75% for 6-beta-naltrexol. The limit of quantification was 5.0 ng/mL for naltrexone and 1.0 ng/mL for 6-beta-naltrexol.

However, lower dosages reportedly have been hepatotoxic in some patients.

The mechanism of action of naltrexone in alcoholism is not understood; however, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone is thought to act as a competitive antagonist at mc, kappa, and delta receptors in the CNS, with the highest affintiy for the mu receptor. Naltrexone competitively binds to such receptors and may block the effects of endogenous opioids. This leads to the antagonization of most of the subjective and objective effects of opiates, including respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, and drug craving.
