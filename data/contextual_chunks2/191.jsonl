Street meth dosages vary by how pure the material is, by individual tolerance based on past usage, how frequently it is used, and by differences in individual reaction. Dosages given below are based on pure meth for an infrequent user. Pharmaceutical methamphetamine, prescribed rarely for obesity and ADD/ADHD, is sold in the US in 5 mg tablets (10 mg tablets have been discontinued in the United States) that are intended to be taken orally (some are sustained release outside the US).

Dosages of 10-25 mg per day are common for prescription pharmaceutical methamphetamine taken orally, usually spread out into two doses. A common (although unhealthy) use pattern for methamphetamine is to redose repeatedly for several days in a row. Depending on whether the intention is to stay awake, remain euphoric, or attempt to continue getting 'rushing' effects, doses are repeated every 3-8 hours (to stay awake) or every .5 to 4 hours (to remain \"high\"). Redosing often involves taking the same dose as the initial dose. As redosing continues beyond 48 hours, the dosages tend to go up. Tolerance to meth's effects -- where larger doses are required to achieve similar effects -- increases with frequency of use and with experience.
