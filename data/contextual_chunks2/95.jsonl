It is most often self-regulating.\n\nTolerance to the effects of psilocin is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Psilocin presents cross-tolerance with all psychedelics, meaning that after the consumption of psilocin all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.\n\nLegal status\n\nPsilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, meaning the possession and sale of it (including psilocin and psilocybin-containing mushrooms) is prohibited in most countries.[18]\n\nBelgium: Possession and sale of mushrooms have been illegal since 1988.[citation needed]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides an overview of psilocin's low addiction potential and rapid tolerance development, highlighting its self-regulating use. It also details the legal status of psilocin internationally, noting its classification as a Schedule I drug and specific country regulations such as Belgium's prohibition on mushroom sales since 1988.\n                "}
