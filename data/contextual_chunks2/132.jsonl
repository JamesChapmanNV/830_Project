Ketamine was used for anaesthesia because it suppresses breathing much less than most other available anaesthetics, but in the 1970's patients began to report unwanted visions while under its influence. In 1978, John Lilly published his book \"The Scientist\" and Ketamine popularity grew through the 1980s until in 1995 the DEA added Ketamine to its \"emerging drugs list\". In 1998 & 1999, Ketamine was lumped by media and legislators with GHB as a 'date rape drug' and a 'club drug' and was emergency scheduled by the DEA on August 12, 1999.\n\nTerminology / Slang #\n\nBrand Names:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides a summary of ketamine's pharmacology, production history, and key historical milestones, including its synthesis in 1962, medical use developments, and classification as a drug of concern in the 1990s.
