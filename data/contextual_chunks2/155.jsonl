A single tab usually contains between 30 - 100 ug of LSD. Paper blotters are created by taking a sheet of absorbant paper (usually decorated and perforated) and soaking it in a dilution of lysergic acid diethylamide. The dilution can vary greatly from one batch to another, or one chemist to another. Because of the method used to make blotter tabs, there is no practical way to know the exact dosage of a particular tab without either trying it or knowing the chemist. Adjacent tabs on a sheet will usually contain very similar levels of LSD. Because a blotter tab is so small, only extremely potent chemicals such as LSD can fit at active levels. See the Strychnine myth.\n\n[Caution: As of 2013, the potent NBOMe compounds appear to be supplanting LSD on a significant portion of acid-style blotter, sometimes misrepresented as LSD by dealers.\n\nLiquid\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the common forms and measurement of LSD, including blotter, liquid, and gelatin, with emphasis on dosage ranges, preparation methods, and associated cautionary notes, providing essential information for understanding LSD administration and potency within the broader drug reference document.\n                "}

Liquid LSD is used in the creation of blotter tabs. A single drop of potent liquid LSD could be 50 times a normal dose, although it is generally diluted to the point where a single drop is equal to approximately one dose. This varies greatly from batch to batch, and is sometimes a weak dose while othertimes a very strong dose. Liquid LSD is somewhat uncommon. Be extremely careful when dealing with it as there is no way for the average person to gauge its potency. It is frequently stored in small dropper bottles. Caution: when one reaches the end of the bottle, one should not rinse it out and assume that what remains is a small dose. There can still be many doses left along the inside surfaces and taking them all at once can lead to some unexpectedly strong and possibly very uncomfortable experiences.\n\nGelatin\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on LSD in liquid form, highlighting its solubility, common dilution methods, dosage variability, and associated safety precautions.
