It is an alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist and frequently used in veterinary medicine as an emetic and sedative with analgesic and muscle relaxant properties. It has a role as an emetic, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a sedative, a muscle relaxant and an analgesic. It is a methylbenzene, a 1,3-thiazine and a secondary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a xylazine(1+).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed chemical identifiers, structural, safety, and pharmacological information on xylazine, including its molecular formula, weight, synonyms, and description of its chemical properties and medical uses. It functions as an essential summarized reference within the larger PubChem compound database, facilitating quick retrieval of key data for research and safety assessments. Its inclusion supports comprehensive chemical and pharmacological profiling of xylazine in the overall document.\n                "}

It acts as an agonist at α2 adrenoceptors; however, its affinity is lower than the one reported for other α2 adrenergic receptor agonists such as [detomidine] and [medetomidine]. Xylazine is not approved for human use and requires a veterinary licence for its purchase and use. The intentional and unintentional use of xylazine is a cause for concern due to its side effects. The use of xylazine can lead to hypotension and bradycardia, and when combined with central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, it can significantly depress vital functions and increase the risk of overdose and death. Xylazine is sometimes used as an adulterant and combined with opioids and recreational drugs; however, it has no antidote, and the use of [naloxone] has no effect on xylazine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides a pharmacological overview of xylazine, highlighting its use as a veterinary tranquilizer, mechanism of action at α2 adrenoceptors, and safety concerns such as side effects, contraindications with other depressants, and issues related to misuse and lack of an antidote, contextualizing its medical and toxicological profile within the comprehensive chemical data on PubChem.\n                "}
