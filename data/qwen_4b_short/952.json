Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "My friend doesn't crack his back neck fingers he only cracks his Feet. Disgusting."

First, I need to check if this post relates to drug use. The label rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about their friend cracking their neck fingers and feet. Wait, "crack his back neck fingers" might be a typo or a misstatement. Maybe they meant "back of the neck fingers"? But even so, the main point is about cracking fingers and feet. The word "crack" here is used in a physical sense, like making a popping sound when joints are moved. The user says it's disgusting. 

Now, is there any mention of drugs here? The post doesn't mention any drugs, drug use, slang, or related terms. The mention of cracking fingers or feet is a physical action, possibly a metaphor, but not related to drug use. The word "disgusting" is an opinion, not related to drugs. There's no indication of seeking, buying, selling, or using drugs. 

So, according to the rules, since there's no mention of drug-related terms or actions, this should be labeled F. The user is just describing a physical action and expressing a personal opinion about it, which doesn't fall under the T category. Therefore, the correct label is F.
