Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "You smoking crack my guy. There was no coup. There was fraud. To deny it is being at best intellectually dishonest and at worst straight up fucking lying..the history books will support it."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for any mention of drugs, their use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. 

Looking at the first part: "You smoking crack my guy." The word "crack" is a slang term for a type of illicit drug, specifically crack cocaine. The phrase "smoking crack" directly refers to using the drug. So that's a clear T.

The rest of the post talks about a coup and fraud, which are political issues. The part about history books supporting it is probably referring to historical events, but the main point here is the mention of "crack" which is a drug. The other parts don't mention drug use, so they don't affect the label. 

Since the post includes the term "crack" in the context of use, it's a T. The other parts are about politics and denial of events, but the presence of the drug reference makes it T. The answer should be T.
