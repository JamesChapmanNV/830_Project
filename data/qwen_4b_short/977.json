Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "for a start, i sold a whole case of codeine and promethazine, I'm bout to make this green". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the person mentions selling codeine and promethazine. Both of these are controlled substances, typically used medically but also abused. Selling them would fall under trafficking or selling, which are part of the T category. 

The phrase "I'm bout to make this green" is a bit unclear. "Make this green" could be a slang term, but I'm not sure. However, the main part of the post is about selling codeine and promethazine, which clearly relates to drug trafficking. 

Since the post explicitly mentions selling these drugs, it definitely fits the T category. Even if the second part is ambiguous, the first part is enough to label it as T. So the answer should be T.
