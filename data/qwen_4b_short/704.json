Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Lowered cannabis prices to help who? Illegal drug issue is a police matter. Properly funding RNC and RCMP is where the need is. Helping friends sell more 'legal' weed is not the answer. #nlpoli"

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main points are about lowered cannabis prices, the illegal drug issue being a police matter, funding RNC and RCMP, and criticizing helping friends sell more 'legal' weed. 

Now, checking for any drug use terms. The mention of "cannabis" is a drug, but the context here is about pricing and policy. The phrase "helping friends sell more 'legal' weed" uses the term "weed," which is slang for cannabis. However, the key is whether this is indicating actual drug use or just discussing it in a policy context. 

The user is talking about selling cannabis, which is a form of drug trafficking or selling. The term "legal" here might be a bit tricky. If cannabis is legal in the area (like in some provinces in Canada), then "legal weed" is a term used for cannabis. However, the post is about helping friends sell it, which could be seen as promoting or facilitating the sale, which might be considered trafficking. But the user is not explicitly stating they are using or seeking drugs. They are discussing policy and funding.

The hashtag #nlpoli might refer to a political topic, possibly related to cannabis policy. The main argument is about funding law enforcement and not supporting the sale of cannabis. The mention of "selling more 'legal' weed" is a bit ambiguous. If the cannabis is legal, selling it might be a legal activity, but the context here is that the user is against helping friends sell it, implying that even if it's legal, they don't support that. However, the label rules are about showing drug use, not about the legality. 

But the key is whether the text shows drug use. The post is discussing the sale of cannabis, which is a drug. The term "selling" is part of the drug trafficking or selling category. However, the user is not using the drug themselves, but rather discussing the sale. The phrase "helping friends sell more" could be seen as promoting the sale, which is part of the drug trafficking or selling category. 

But the label T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. If the cannabis is legal, then selling it isn't illicit. However, the user is in a context where cannabis might be illegal (like in some regions). The post is a bit ambiguous. However, the term "legal weed" is used, which might indicate that in the context of the post, it's legal, but the user is against helping friends sell it. 

Alternatively, the user might be in a place where cannabis is legal, and the post is about policy. The mention of "illegal drug issue" is a bit conflicting. The user says that the issue is a police matter, implying that cannabis is still considered illegal. But the term "legal weed" is used, which is a contradiction. 

Given the ambiguity, but according to the label rules, if the text is discussing selling drugs (even if they are legal), does that count as T? The rules specify "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." Selling is part of T. So even if the drug is legal, the act of selling is part of the category. However, if the drug is legal, then the user is not engaging in illicit activity. But the label is about whether the text shows drug use. The post is about selling cannabis, which is a drug. So the act of selling is part of T. 

But the user is not using the drug, but discussing the sale. However, the label is about whether the text shows drug use. So if the text is about selling, that's part of T. Therefore, the label would be T. However, the user is against helping friends sell it, which is a policy discussion. But the mention of selling is part of the T category. 

Alternatively, if the cannabis is legal, then selling it is not illicit, so maybe it's F. But the user is in a context where cannabis is illegal, so selling it is part of T. But the post is a bit confusing. 

Given the ambiguity, but according to the rules, any mention of selling drugs (even if they are legal) is part of T. However, the user is not using the drug, but discussing the sale. The label is about whether the text shows drug use. The act of selling is part of drug use. Therefore, the answer is T. But I need to check the exact rules again. The rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So selling is part of T. Therefore, the label is T.
