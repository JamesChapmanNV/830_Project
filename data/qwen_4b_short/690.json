Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Pour codeine on her 😋💦, It taste like Tahitian 🤘🏾😈".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "codeine" and "taste like Tahitian". Codeine is a controlled substance, an opioid, which is classified as an illicit drug. The phrase "pour codeine on her" suggests administration of the drug, which could be part of drug use or abuse. 

But wait, the second part says "It taste like Tahitian". That seems like a metaphor or slang. Maybe "Tahitian" is a slang term for something else? Or is it a reference to a specific drug? I'm not sure. However, the main point is that codeine is explicitly mentioned. The act of pouring codeine on someone could be a form of drug use, possibly in a harmful or abusive context. 

The rules state that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, "codeine" is a drug, and the action of pouring it on someone might be part of using or abusing it. The emojis might add context, but the main content is the mention of codeine. 

So even if "Tahitian" is a metaphor, the presence of codeine alone makes this a T. Unless "Tahitian" is a slang term for something else, but I don't think that's the case here. The key is that codeine is an illicit drug, and the action is using it. Therefore, the label should be T.
