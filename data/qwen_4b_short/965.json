Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "What if she got Rue high on morphine so she can sell her???????" 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if there's text about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, "Rue" might be a name, but the key part is "high on morphine". Morphine is a controlled substance, an opioid, which is definitely an illicit or abusive drug. The phrase "high on morphine" indicates drug use. 

Then the part "so she can sell her" is a bit unclear. Maybe "sell her" refers to selling something else, but given the context, it's possible that "her" refers to a person, implying that she's using morphine to sell someone else, which could be trafficking or selling drugs. However, the main point here is the mention of morphine use. 

The user might be using "Rue" as a name, but the key elements are morphine and the intent to sell. Since morphine is a drug and the post mentions using it (getting high), that's a T. The part about selling might be a red herring, but the presence of drug use is enough for T. 

So the label should be T.
