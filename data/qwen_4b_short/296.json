Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about someone's experience in con sketching and their desire to let fellow artists try different things instead of repeating certain characters like Harley Quinn and Deadpool.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The keywords to look for are using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about art, sketching, and artists. There's no mention of drugs or related activities. The mention of Harley Quinn and Deadpool are fictional characters, not related to drugs. The person is discussing their creative process and encouraging others to try new things in art. 

Since there's no drug-related content, the label should be F. The rules state that F is for all other cases, which includes medical, policy, news, or discouraging use, but also any other context not involving drugs. The post doesn't fit into any of the T categories. So the answer is F.
