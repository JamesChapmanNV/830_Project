Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about Mac Miller's overdose and mentions "Black people's business" and an R&B album. 

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "overdose," which directly relates to drug use. The mention of Mac Miller's overdose is a real event, so that's a clear T. 

Then there's the part about "Black people's business." That seems like a metaphor or a comment on racial issues, not directly about drug use. The R&B album reference is probably a metaphor for something else, maybe a project or a strategy. 

The rules state that T is for any text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The overdose is a direct indicator of drug use, so even if the rest of the post is metaphorical, the mention of overdose would make it T. 

I need to make sure there's no other drug-related slang or terms. The post doesn't mention specific drugs, but the overdose itself is a clear sign. The rest of the text is more about social or racial commentary, which falls under F. But since the overdose is present, the label should be T.
