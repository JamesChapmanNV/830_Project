Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: ""I'm on Ocean Drive sippin codeine with the top down, 20 grand on me and a glock 9" -21"

First, I need to check if this text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, "sippin codeine" is a clear reference to using codeine, which is an illicit drug. The mention of "20 grand on me" might refer to having a lot of money, which could be related to drug trafficking or selling, but the main action here is the use of codeine. The "glock 9" is a type of handgun, which might indicate possession of a weapon, possibly linked to drug activities, but the primary focus here is on the drug use. 

The user is on Ocean Drive, which is a location, but that's not relevant here. The key elements are "sippin codeine" and the mention of having money and a gun. Since codeine is an illicit drug and the person is using it, this should be labeled T. The other elements like money and a gun might be part of the context but the main action is the drug use. So the answer should be T.
