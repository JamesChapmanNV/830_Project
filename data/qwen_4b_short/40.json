Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about the person losing their dad to midazolam and morphine in Scotland in May 2020. They mention being in the angry stage of grief and expressing sadness.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The drugs mentioned are midazolam and morphine. Midazolam is a medication, often used as a sedative in medical settings. Morphine is a potent opioid used for pain management. However, the context here is that the person's father died from these drugs. The post doesn't explicitly state that the drugs were used illicitly or in an abusive way. It's more about the person's grief and the circumstances of their father's death. 

The rules say T is for text showing drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang). The post doesn't mention any of these actions. The person is talking about their father's death, not their own use or involvement with drugs. The mention of midazolam and morphine is in the context of medical treatment, possibly in a hospital setting. Since the post is about the person's emotional state and the cause of death, not their own drug use or related activities, it's more of a F case. 

So the label should be F because it's about a medical situation and grief, not drug abuse or illicit use.
