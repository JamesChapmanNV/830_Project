Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "It's so hard not to tip the tourney dealer. I do the same thing. I play more love cash than live tourneys."

First, I need to understand what the labels mean. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "tourney dealer," "tip," "love cash," and "live tourneys." The user mentions tipping a dealer, which might be a reference to gambling or casino-related activities. "Love cash" could be a slang term, but I'm not sure. "Tourney dealer" might be a term from poker or gambling, where a dealer is someone who handles the game. 

Now, checking if any of these terms relate to drug use. The word "tip" in this context is likely related to tipping a dealer in a gambling setting, not drug use. "Love cash" isn't a standard slang for drugs. The mention of "tourney" and "dealer" seems to be about gambling or poker tournaments. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or related terms like buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The user is talking about their own behavior in gambling, not about drug use. So, the post doesn't fit the T category. Therefore, the correct label should be F.
