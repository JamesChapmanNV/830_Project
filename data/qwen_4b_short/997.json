Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I stream Wednesday - Sunday. Path to partner ðŸ˜ƒ 3.1/75 average viewers âš I use flashing lightsâš ". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the main parts are about streaming from Wednesday to Sunday, a "Path to partner" which might be a typo or a reference to something else, a 3.1/75 average viewers, and a warning about using flashing lights. 

The key part here is "I use flashing lights". Now, "flashing lights" could be a slang term for drugs. I remember that in some contexts, "flashing lights" is a slang term for methamphetamine, which is a controlled substance. Meth users sometimes use flashing lights as a way to signal each other or to indicate they're in a meth lab. So, if the person is using flashing lights as a slang term for drug use, that would be a T. 

But I need to be careful. Is there any other possible interpretation? Maybe the person is talking about using flashing lights in a different context, like in a stream or for some other purpose. However, given the context of drug abuse moderation, the term "flashing lights" is more likely to be a slang term related to drug use. 

Also, the mention of "Path to partner" might be a typo or a reference to something else, but the main indicator here is the "flashing lights" part. Since the rules include slang for drugs, and "flashing lights" is a known slang term, this should be labeled as T. 

So the answer is T.
