Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Morphine recommendation please - need one to live in while we build our house in Greece".

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The key here is to determine if the post is about drug use. The user is asking for a "Morphine recommendation". Morphine is a controlled substance, an opioid, used for pain management, typically prescribed medically. However, the phrase "need one to live in" is a bit confusing. Wait, "live in" here might be a metaphor or a slang term. But in the context of drug use, "live in" could be a way of saying they need a supply or are seeking to use it. Alternatively, it could be a misunderstanding. 

But the main point is whether the post is about drug use. The mention of morphine, which is a drug, and the request for a recommendation could be related to drug use. However, the context is "need one to live in while we build our house in Greece". That part is a bit unclear. Maybe they are trying to say they need a morphine prescription to manage pain while building a house, which could be a medical use. But the phrasing is odd. 

Alternatively, "need one to live in" might be a slang term for needing a drug. But the user is asking for a recommendation, which is a bit strange. However, the rules state that T includes seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. So if "need one to live in" is slang for using or seeking, then it would be T. But if it's a metaphor or a misunderstanding, maybe not. 

But the key is that morphine is a drug. The post is asking for a recommendation for morphine, which is a drug. Even if the context is a bit odd, the mention of morphine is a drug, and the request for a recommendation could be related to seeking it. However, the user might be asking for a medical recommendation, like a doctor's advice. But the rules include medical discussions as F. Wait, the rules say F is for medical/policy discussion, etc. So if the post is a medical discussion, it's F. But if it's about seeking or using drugs, it's T.

But the problem is the phrase "need one to live in". That's not standard. Maybe the user is trying to say they need a morphine supply to live with them while building a house. But that's not a standard way to phrase it. Alternatively, "live in" could be a slang term for using the drug. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But according to the rules, if the text shows drug use (seeking, buying, etc.), it's T. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for a medical recommendation for morphine, which is a legitimate medical use. So in that case, it's F. But the problem is the phrasing is odd. The user is asking for a "recommendation please - need one to live in". That seems like they are seeking to use morphine, which is a drug. So maybe T. But I need to check the rules again. 

The rules state T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs". The post mentions morphine, which is a drug, and the request for a recommendation could be seeking. The phrase "need one to live in" might be a slang or a metaphor, but if it's about seeking, then it's T. Alternatively, if it's a medical discussion, it's F. 

But the user is asking for a recommendation, which could be a medical context. However, the way it's phrased is odd. Maybe the user is not a medical professional and is asking for a recommendation, which might be a misuse. But according to the rules, if it's a medical discussion, it's F. However, if the intent is to seek the drug, then T. 

This is a bit ambiguous. But given that morphine is a controlled substance, and the request is for a recommendation, which could be related to using it, the label might be T. However, if it's a medical discussion, then F. But the way it's phrased is unclear. 

Alternatively, the user might be asking for a recommendation for a morphine prescription, which is a medical use. So that would be F. But the problem is the phrase "need one to live in" is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in phrasing. 

In this case, I think the safest answer is T because the mention of morphine (a drug) and the request for a recommendation could be related to seeking or using it. The phrase "need one to live in" might be a slang or a misunderstanding, but the presence of morphine as a drug would trigger T. However, if it's a medical context, then F. 

But the rules state that F includes medical/policy discussion. So if the post is a medical discussion, then F. But the way the user is phrasing it is not standard. It's possible that they are not a medical professional and are seeking to use morphine, which would be T. 

Given that, I think the answer is T.
