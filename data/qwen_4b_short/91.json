Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone criticizing a person for their prejudiced view and a tweet about an overdose. 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "overdose" and "addict." The person mentioned is Demi, and the tweet was "one less addict in the world." The user is pointing out that the person had a pre-existing prejudice and tweeted after her overdose.

The rules say T if there's mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post doesn't explicitly mention using drugs, but it does refer to an overdose, which is related to drug use. However, the main focus here is on the person's prejudice and the tweet. The tweet itself is about the number of addicts, which is a statement about drug use, but the context is about the person's prejudice and the tweet's content.

Wait, the label rules say T if the text shows drug use. The post doesn't state that the person is using drugs, but the tweet was about an overdose. The user is criticizing the person for their tweet. The tweet itself is about the number of addicts, which is a statement related to drug use. But the main content of the post is about the person's prejudice and the tweet. However, the tweet is part of the post. 

The question is whether the text shows drug use. The tweet is "one less addict in the world," which is a statement about drug use (addict). So the text does mention drug-related terms. Therefore, according to the rules, this would be T. But wait, the user is not talking about their own use but the person's tweet. The post is about the person's prejudice and the tweet. The tweet is about the person's statement, which is related to drug use. So the text does show drug use (addict), so the label should be T. But maybe the post is not about the user's own drug use but the person's statement. However, the rules are about the text showing drug use. Since the tweet is part of the text, and the tweet is about addicts, which is related to drug use, the label would be T. Alternatively, maybe the post is about the person's prejudice, but the tweet is part of the text. The rules say T if the text shows drug use, so the answer is T.
