Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post "No shit there was a fucking pandemic going on" as either T or F based on the given rules. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drugs. The post says "there was a fucking pandemic going on." The word "pandemic" is key here. A pandemic is a widespread outbreak of a disease, like COVID-19. The phrase "fucking" is an intensifier, but it's not related to drugs. The user is talking about a pandemic, which is a public health event, not drug use. There's no mention of drugs, slang, or any related activities. The post is a statement about a pandemic, possibly expressing frustration or disbelief. Since there's no reference to drugs or drug-related activities, the label should be F. The user might be using "fucking" to emphasize the statement, but that doesn't relate to the drug abuse rules. So the answer is F.
