Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a quote from Prophet Muhammad regarding taking a false oath, specifically mentioning Arak tree. 

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The hashtag #Arak tree might be relevant here. Arak is a type of spirit, which is a strong alcoholic drink. In some contexts, it's considered a controlled substance, especially in regions where alcohol is restricted. However, the post is discussing a religious statement about taking oaths, not directly about using or selling drugs.

The key here is whether the text shows drug use. The mention of Arak is part of a metaphor or religious context. The post is quoting a religious teaching, not discussing the use of drugs. There's no explicit mention of buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The focus is on a religious obligation, not on drug-related activities. 

So, according to the rules, T is for drug use, and F is for other cases. Since the post is about a religious statement and not about drug use, the label should be F. The mention of Arak is part of the context of the oath, not the drug itself. Therefore, the answer is F.
