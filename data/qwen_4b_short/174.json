Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about "Threads Soaked In Heroin Worth Rs 450 Crore Seized From Gujarat Port." 

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key words here are "heroin" and "seized." Heroin is an illicit drug, so that's a clear indicator. The mention of "seized" suggests that the drugs were taken from someone, which relates to trafficking or possession. The phrase "threads soaked in heroin" is a bit odd, but "soaked in" might be a metaphor, but in this context, it's likely referring to the actual drug. 

The label rules say T if it's about drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Since heroin is an illicit drug and the post is about seizing it, this would fall under trafficking or possession. Therefore, the label should be T. 

Wait, but the user mentioned to return only T or F. The post is about the seizure of heroin, which is directly related to drug trafficking. So the answer is T. I don't see any other elements here that would make it F. The post is factual but the content is about drug trafficking, so T is correct.
