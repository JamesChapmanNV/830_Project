Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Even if he did die of a drug overdose."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key part is "die of a drug overdose." The word "overdose" is directly related to drug use, specifically indicating that someone has used a drug in a way that caused their death. The phrase "drug overdose" is a direct reference to illicit drug use leading to a fatal outcome. 

Now, checking if this fits the T category. The post isn't just talking about a metaphor or a medical discussion. It's stating a fact about someone's death due to a drug overdose, which is a direct reference to drug use. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled as T.

I should make sure there's no ambiguity. The post doesn't mention any other context that would make it a metaphor or a non-drug-related situation. The term "drug overdose" is a clear indicator of illicit drug use. So the correct label here is T.
