Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "I'm on them beans, alcohol, booku loud, and that codeine". The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, or F for other cases.

First, I need to break down each term in the post. The user mentions "them beans". "Beans" can be slang for cannabis, which is a controlled substance. Then "alcohol" is a legal drug, but in some contexts, it might be considered a substance of abuse. Next, "booku loud" â€“ I'm not sure about that. Maybe "booku" is a misspelling or slang. "Booku" could be a variant of "buku", which I think is slang for cannabis in some regions. "Loud" might be a typo or a different term. Then "codeine" is an opioid, which is a controlled substance.

So, the user is listing substances they are using: cannabis (beans, booku), alcohol, and codeine. All of these are substances that are considered illicit or abusive in the context of drug abuse. Even though alcohol is legal, in the context of drug abuse, it's often discussed as a substance of abuse. However, the label rules specify that T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs". So, "beans" and "booku" are slang for drugs, and codeine is a controlled substance. Therefore, the post is showing illicit or abusive drug use. The answer should be T.
