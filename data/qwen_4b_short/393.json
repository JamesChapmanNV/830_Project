Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about Hawaii, Colorado, and Maryland discussing psychedelic reform and cannabis in modern medicine. The hashtags are #medicine and #cannabis.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The keywords here are "psychedelic reform" and "cannabis into modern medicine." Psychedelics can refer to drugs like LSD or psilocybin, which are sometimes used in therapeutic contexts. However, the post is talking about reform and medical use, not personal use or trafficking. The mention of cannabis in modern medicine is about medical applications, not recreational or illegal use. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. It's more about legislative actions and medical research. The hashtags are related to medicine and cannabis, which are part of the medical discussion. 

So, since there's no explicit mention of drug use in the illicit sense, but rather policy and medical discussions, the label should be F. The answer is F.
