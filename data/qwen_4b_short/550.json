Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Morrison in deep with this crack head is really very telling."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "crack head." "Crack head" is a slang term for someone who uses crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. The phrase "in deep with" might imply that Morrison is involved with this person, possibly in a negative way, like associating with someone who uses drugs. 

The rules state that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since "crack head" is a direct slang term for drug use, this would fall under T. The other part of the sentence, "is really very telling," might be a metaphor or commentary, but the presence of "crack head" alone is enough to label it as T. 

I need to make sure there's no medical or policy discussion here. The context seems to be a negative reference to someone using drugs, so it's definitely T. No other terms like "medical" or "discouraging use" are present. So the label should be T.
