Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a situation where medical professionals testified that someone was in cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation, and officers didn't mention drugs or overdose, nor check for a pulse or turn the person onto their side. The person is questioning why people still defend the officers.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key here is to see if there's any direct reference to drugs. The post talks about cardiac arrest from asphyxiation, which might be related to drug use, but the main point is about the response of the officers. The user is criticizing the officers' actions, not directly mentioning drugs. The officers didn't mention drugs or overdose, but the post is about their failure to perform medical procedures. The phrase "asphyxiation" could be a red herring. However, the user is not explicitly stating that drugs were involved. The post is more about the medical response and the defense of the officers, not about drug use. So according to the rules, if there's no direct mention of drugs, it's F. But wait, the medical professionals testified about asphyxiation. If asphyxiation is due to drug use, maybe that's a stretch. But the post doesn't specify that. The user is not stating that drugs were used, just that the officers didn't mention them. So the label should be F because there's no direct mention of drug use, seeking, etc. The main topic is about the medical response and the defense of the officers, not about drugs. Therefore, the answer is F.
