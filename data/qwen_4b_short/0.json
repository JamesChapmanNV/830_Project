Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post talks about a guy being hanged in Singapore for having 42 grams of heroin and a Brazilian dealer released by the Supreme Court. 

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key terms here are heroin and cocaine. Heroin is an illicit drug, and cocaine is also illicit. The post mentions someone arrested with heroin and another with cocaine. The first part talks about being hanged (execution) for having heroin, which is a drug. The second part mentions a dealer with tons of cocaine being released. 

The rules say T if it shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post is discussing arrests related to drugs, so that's T. The mention of heroin and cocaine are direct references to drugs. Even though the context is about legal consequences, the presence of the drugs themselves triggers the T label. The other cases (F) would be if it's about medical discussions, news, or discouraging use, but this is about drug-related arrests. So the answer should be T.
