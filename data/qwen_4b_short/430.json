Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a company called American Green, Inc. and their shareholder count increasing. The hashtags include #otcmarkets, #hemp, #cannabis, #cbd, #investors, #cultivation, #marijuana.

First, I need to check if the text mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The company's name and the hashtags relate to hemp, cannabis, CBD, and marijuana. But the post itself is about shareholder counts and stock market information. The keywords here are business-related, not directly about using or seeking drugs. 

The rules say T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention any of these activities. It's more about a business announcement. Even though cannabis and hemp are drugs, the context here is about a company's stock and shareholder numbers, not drug use. 

So, the answer should be F because there's no indication of drug abuse or illicit use mentioned. The hashtags are related to the industry, but the content is about a business update, not drug-related activities.
