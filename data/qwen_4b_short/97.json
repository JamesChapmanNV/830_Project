Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "He's got scissors on his left foot! This dude be doing some hard crack."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the first part: "He's got scissors on his left foot!" That seems like a metaphor or a strange image. Scissors on a foot might be a metaphor for something else, maybe a reference to a drug-related term? Wait, "scissors" here could be a slang term. But I'm not sure. In some contexts, "scissors" might be used as a slang for a drug, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be a literal description, but that's unusual.

The second part: "This dude be doing some hard crack." "Hard crack" is a common slang term for crack cocaine. So that part definitely falls under T. The word "crack" is a direct reference to the drug. 

But the first part is tricky. "Scissors on his left foot" â€“ maybe that's a metaphor for something else, like a medical condition or a metaphorical expression. However, if "scissors" is slang for a drug, then that would be T. But I don't recall "scissors" being a slang term for drugs. It might be a typo or a misheard word. Alternatively, it could be a reference to a drug test or something else. 

But given that the second part clearly mentions "hard crack," which is a drug, the entire post might be labeled as T because it includes a drug reference. However, the first part might not be a drug reference. The user's instruction says to check for any mention of drug use. If "scissors" is not a drug slang, then the first part is F, but the second part is T. However, the rules say to label as T if any part of the text shows drug use. Wait, the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use" so if any part of the text is related, then T. 

But the first part might not be related. Unless "scissors" is a slang. Let me think again. "Scissors" is not a common slang for drugs. "Hard crack" is definitely a slang. So the second part is T. The first part is a strange image, but not related to drugs. Therefore, the overall label would be T because of the "hard crack" part. Even if the first part is not drug-related, the presence of "hard crack" makes the entire post T. 

So the answer should be T.
