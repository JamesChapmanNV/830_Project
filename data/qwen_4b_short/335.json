Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The user is asking me to determine if the given social media post falls under T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). 

First, I need to look at the content of the post. The user mentions turning their life around, 3 years and 3 months off heroin. That's a clear mention of drug use (heroin), so that's a red flag for T. But then they also talk about achievements like releasing albums, live shows, temporary housing, and a real life. These are positive life changes, which might be part of a recovery story.

The key here is whether the text is showing drug use. The mention of heroin is a direct reference to drug use. However, the post is about recovery, so it's not about current use but past use. The label rules specify that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since the person is talking about being off heroin for 3 years and 3 months, that's a past use. But the presence of the term "heroin" itself would still qualify as T, even if it's in the context of recovery. 

But wait, the rules might consider if the text is showing current use or seeking. The post is about past use, so maybe it's not T. However, the rules don't specify time frames. The example given in the rules includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the text mentions the drug, even in the context of recovery, it's still T. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is about overcoming drug use, which is a discussion about recovery, which would be F. But the presence of the drug name (heroin) would still be T. The user is talking about their past drug use, but the label is about whether the text shows drug use. If the text includes the drug name, regardless of context, it's T. 

But the label rules say T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the text is about using drugs, even in the past, it's T. However, if the text is about recovery, maybe it's F. But the presence of the drug name (heroin) is a direct mention of drug use. 

I think the correct label here is T because the text explicitly mentions heroin, which is an illicit drug. Even though it's in the context of recovery, the mention of the drug itself is a T. Therefore, the answer should be T.
