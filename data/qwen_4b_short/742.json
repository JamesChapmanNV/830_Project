Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone who's gone through an overdose and is expressing regret. The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to check if the post mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The text says "it's too late it's too late and you can't go back and undo the overdose." The word "overdose" is a direct reference to drug use. The person is talking about an overdose, which is a result of drug use. The question "Why, why did you have to do it??" implies that the person used drugs, leading to the overdose. 

The label rules state that T is for text showing drug use. Since the post is discussing an overdose, which is a consequence of drug use, it falls under T. The other parts of the post are emotional and about the consequences, but the core issue here is the overdose, which is directly related to drug use. Therefore, the correct label should be T.
