Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is moderating social media posts related to drug abuse. The task is to determine if the given post falls under category T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (all other cases).

The post is: "Oh yea I did Beerus and arak cause i remembered the event existed so why not". First, I need to parse the words here. "Beerus" and "arak" are the key terms. 

Beerus is a name, possibly a person or a reference. But wait, "Beerus" could be a misspelling or a slang term. Alternatively, "Beerus" might be a reference to a character from a video game or a fictional context. However, "arak" is a real thing. Arak is a type of spirit, often associated with Middle Eastern cultures. It's a strong alcohol, sometimes used in traditional settings. But is it considered an illicit drug? Well, arak is an alcoholic drink, not a drug. However, in some contexts, especially in certain regions, arak might be associated with illegal activities, but that's more about the context of its use rather than the substance itself.

The user is talking about "using" Beerus and arak. The phrase "I did Beerus and arak" could be a reference to consuming these substances. But if Beerus is a person, maybe they're referring to something else. Alternatively, if Beerus is a misspelling of "beer" or another term, but that's not clear. However, "arak" is a drink, so if the person is referring to consuming arak, that's a drink, not a drug. Unless arak is being used in a context of abuse, but the post doesn't mention that. The user says they did it because they remembered the event existed, so maybe they're talking about a ritual or a tradition. 

The key here is whether the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. Since arak is an alcoholic drink, not a drug, and Beerus is unclear but not a drug, the post might be F. However, if "Beerus" is a slang term for a drug, then it would be T. But I don't recognize Beerus as a slang term. The user might be using "Beerus" as a name, so it's not a drug. Therefore, the post is about consuming a drink (arak) and possibly a person's name, which doesn't indicate drug use. So the label would be F.
