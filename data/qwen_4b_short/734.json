Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F. The post says, "ima just say 'My Boy ain't overdose', it was that Covid Vaccine he took✌🏽💔😪 But I'm out ‼️‼️😢🥺". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for when the text mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the main message is about a boy who didn't overdose, but the reason given is that he took the Covid vaccine. The user is expressing some emotion, maybe grief or anger, but the key part here is the mention of the vaccine. 

Wait, the user is saying that the boy didn't overdose because he took the vaccine. But the post is in a context where someone might be joking or using slang. However, the term "overdose" is usually associated with drugs, not vaccines. But in this case, the person is using "overdose" in a metaphorical sense, perhaps implying that the vaccine was the cause of the boy's death, but that's not the case. 

But the main point is whether the post shows drug use. The post doesn't mention any drugs directly. It's talking about a vaccine, which is a medical thing. The user might be using "overdose" as a metaphor, but the actual drug use isn't present here. 

So the label would be F because there's no mention of drugs, only a vaccine. The emotions are there, but the content isn't about drug use. The vaccine is a medical intervention, not a drug in the context of abuse. Therefore, the correct label is F.
