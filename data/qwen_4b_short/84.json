Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Sask. Health Authority encourages companies to bring in drug-overdose training".

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main subject is the Sask. Health Authority encouraging companies to provide drug-overdose training. The key terms here are "drug-overdose training". The focus is on training related to overdose, which is a medical or public health issue. There's no mention of actual drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or any slang. Instead, it's about training to prevent overdoses, which is a policy or public health initiative. 

So, the post is discussing a health authority's encouragement for training, which is a medical or policy-related topic. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F. There's no indication of drug use or related activities here. The training is about preventing overdoses, not about using or dealing with drugs. Hence, the correct label is F.
