Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a car lease deal from City Kia. The key here is to check if there's any mention of drugs, drug use, or related slang.

The post mentions "Save big this October with great offers from City Kia. Lease a new 2022 Kia Carnival LX for just $299/Month! Offer ends 10/4/21. See dealer for details." There's no mention of drugs, drug use, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang related to drugs. The content is purely about a car lease offer. The words "save big," "great offers," and the car model are all related to a business promotion. There's no mention of anything that would fall under the T category. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's a regular case, not related to drug abuse. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden references or slang. But "Kia Carnival" is a car model, and the offer is for leasing a car. Definitely F.
