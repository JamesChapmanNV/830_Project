Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is about a link to watch an NBA game between the Dallas Mavericks and Utah Jazz. The user provided some hashtags and a click link.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if there's text showing use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post: It's a link to watch an NBA game. The text includes hashtags related to sports and the game. The only part that might be questionable is the "CLICK ====v ;" part. But that seems like a typo or a formatting error, maybe a placeholder for a link. However, there's no mention of drugs, drug-related terms, or any slang. The hashtags are about sports, so that's not related. 

No words like "drug," "herb," "marijuana," "cocaine," or any other drug terms are present. The post is purely about a sports event. So according to the rules, since there's no mention of drug use or related terms, the label should be F.
