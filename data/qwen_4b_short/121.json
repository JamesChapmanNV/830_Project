Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about U.S. new vehicle sales dropping 26% in September due to chip shortages and supply chain issues. 

First, I need to check if the post mentions anything related to drug use. The keywords to look for are using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about vehicle sales, chip shortages, parts supply, and prices. There's no mention of drugs or related terms. 

The label rules say T if it's about drug use, otherwise F. Since the post is about automotive sales and supply chain issues, it doesn't fit the T category. So the correct label should be F. I need to make sure there's no hidden metaphor or slang I'm missing. But "chip shortages" and "parts supply" are technical terms related to manufacturing, not drugs. Therefore, the answer is F.
