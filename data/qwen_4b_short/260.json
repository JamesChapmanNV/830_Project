Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Sources: Codeine addiction, NFL drug policy cloud LB Rolando McClain's future with Cowboys".

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Codeine addiction". Codeine is a controlled substance, and addiction to it would fall under drug abuse. The NFL drug policy is mentioned, which relates to drug use in sports, so that's part of the context. The post is talking about how this addiction and the policy are affecting a player's future. 

The rules state that T is for any text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, "Codeine addiction" directly refers to the use of codeine, which is a drug. Even though it's mentioned in the context of a sports team's policy, the core issue is the addiction, which is a form of drug abuse. 

The other cases (F) are for medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. This post is not a metaphor; it's a news-related statement about a player's situation due to drug use. So, it should be labeled T. 

I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. The term "addiction" here is a clear indicator of drug use. The NFL policy is part of the context but doesn't change the fact that the main subject is drug addiction. Therefore, the correct label is T.
