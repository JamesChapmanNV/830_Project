Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Lol my family hates my trap/coke hyena/codeine music. Their like you ain't about that life. True but its turnt."

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The keywords here are "trap," "coke," "hyena," and "codeine." Let me break it down.

"Trap" can refer to trap music, which is a genre, but sometimes "trap" is slang for something else. However, in this context, the user is using "trap" along with "coke" and "codeine," which are definitely drugs. "Coke" is a slang term for cocaine, which is an illicit drug. "Codeine" is an opioid, also used illicitly. "Hyena" here might be a slang term, but I'm not sure. Wait, "hyena" is sometimes used in slang for drugs, like "hyena" as a term for a drug user, but I'm not certain. However, given that "coke" and "codeine" are clearly drugs, the presence of those terms should trigger the T label.

The rest of the sentence is about the family disapproving of the music, which is a metaphor for drug use. The phrase "you ain't about that life" is a common expression in rap culture referring to a lifestyle associated with drug use. The word "turnt" is slang that can mean "turned" or "dope," but in this context, it's likely referring to being into drugs. 

So, even though some terms might be ambiguous, the presence of "coke" and "codeine" clearly indicates drug use. The other terms like "trap" and "hyena" might be part of the slang or music reference, but the key here is that the post is about drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
