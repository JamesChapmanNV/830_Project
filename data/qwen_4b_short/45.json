Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about the effects of overdosing on fentanyl or other opiates and benzodiazepines, mentioning depression of the central nervous system, loss of consciousness, stopping breathing, cardiac arrest, and hypoxia as a symptom.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post is explaining the medical consequences of drug overdose. It's providing information about the physiological effects of fentanyl and other drugs. The mention of fentanyl is a specific drug, which is illicit. However, the post isn't about using or seeking the drug; it's explaining the dangers of overdose. The user is informing others about the risks, which might fall under F if it's a medical discussion. But wait, the presence of the drug name (fentanyl) might trigger T. However, the context is educational, not promoting use. The rules mention that T includes "slang for drugs," but here it's the actual drug name. 

But the key is whether the text shows drug use. The post is not about using the drug, but about the effects of overdose. So maybe it's F. But I need to check if mentioning the drug's name counts as showing drug use. The rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the post is discussing the drug's effects, is that considered showing drug use? Or is it just discussing the consequences? 

In the example, the post is explaining the medical consequences, not promoting or discussing the use. Therefore, it's more of a medical discussion, so F. But the presence of the drug name might be a point of contention. However, the label rules specify that T includes drug names if they are part of the discussion about use. But the post isn't about using the drug; it's about the effects of overdose. So I think the correct label is F. Wait, but the first part says "when you overdose on fentanyl..." which is a direct mention of drug use. However, the context is about the consequences, not the act of using. The rules might consider that mentioning the drug in a medical context is F. So the answer is F.
