Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "It's gonna fuck me up if Isbell plays Codeine and Alabama Pines next Thursday."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key words here are "Codeine" and "Alabama Pines." Codeine is a controlled substance, an opioid, which is classified as an illicit drug. But wait, is Codeine considered a slang term here? Or is it a proper noun? Wait, "Codeine" is a drug, so that's a direct reference to a drug. Then "Alabama Pines" â€“ I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe it's a song title? Like a band or a song? If it's a song, maybe the lyrics or the context of the song could be related to drug use. But the user is talking about the band Isbell playing these songs. 

But the main point here is the mention of Codeine. Since Codeine is a drug, even if it's a song title, the mention of the drug itself would trigger the T label. The phrase "It's gonna fuck me up" is a metaphor, but the presence of the drug name would still be a T. 

Wait, the rules say T if the text shows drug use. So even if the song is about drugs, but the user is referring to the drug name, that's a T. The post is talking about the band Isbell playing songs that include Codeine. So if the song is named Codeine, that's a direct reference. But maybe the user is using the song title to refer to the drug. Alternatively, maybe "Alabama Pines" is a song that's associated with drug use. 

But regardless, the presence of "Codeine" in the text is a direct mention of a drug. So according to the rules, that would be T. The other part about "fuck me up" is a metaphor, but the actual drug reference is there. So the label should be T.
