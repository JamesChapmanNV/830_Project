Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "2 illegal immigrants smuggling $700K in heroin, authorities say". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key words here are "smuggling $700K in heroin". Smuggling heroin would relate to trafficking, which is part of the T category. The mention of heroin is a specific drug, so that's definitely a drug. The fact that it's being smuggled by illegal immigrants suggests involvement in the trafficking of drugs. 

The post doesn't mention any personal use or seeking drugs, but rather the act of smuggling, which is part of the drug trafficking. So according to the rules, this would be T. The authorities saying this is just reporting the event, but the content itself is about drug trafficking. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that might make it F. The post is about smuggling heroin, which is a drug, so it's definitely T. The answer should be T.
