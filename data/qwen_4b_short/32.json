Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "This is clear...let's not crack our heads."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, including medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The phrase "crack our heads" is a bit tricky. "Crack" can have multiple meanings. In a literal sense, it might refer to physically cracking something, but in slang, "crack" can be a term related to drugs, specifically crack cocaine. However, the phrase here is "crack our heads," which might be a metaphor. 

But wait, the user is moderating for drug abuse. So I need to check if "crack" here is slang for a drug. If "crack" is used as a slang term for crack cocaine, then "crack our heads" could be a metaphor for using the drug. However, the phrase "crack our heads" is not a common slang term. It might be a metaphor for something else, like causing harm or stress. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the drug "crack" (cocaine) and the phrase is a metaphor for something related to drug use. But without more context, it's hard to be certain. However, the rules state that if the text shows drug use, it's T. If it's a metaphor, then F.

But "crack our heads" is not a standard slang. The more common slang would be "crack" as in the drug. However, the phrase here is "crack our heads," which might not directly relate to drug use. It could be a metaphor for something else, like mental stress. 

Alternatively, maybe the person is using "crack" as a slang term for the drug, and "our heads" as a metaphor for the effects of the drug. But I'm not sure. Since the rules are strict, I need to check if the text shows drug use. If the user is using "crack" as a slang term, then it's T. But if it's a metaphor, then F.

Given that "crack" is a slang for crack cocaine, and the phrase "crack our heads" is not a standard expression, but maybe the user is trying to imply that the drug is causing problems. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But according to the rules, if the text includes slang for drugs, it's T. Since "crack" is a slang term, even if the phrase is a metaphor, the presence of the word "crack" (as a drug) would make it T. 

But wait, the post is "crack our heads." If "crack" is the drug, then the phrase is a metaphor. But if the phrase is not a standard slang, then it's not T. However, the rules state that T includes "slang for drugs." So if "crack" is a slang term, then even if the phrase is a metaphor, it's still T. 

Alternatively, maybe the phrase is not referring to the drug. Maybe it's a metaphor for something else. But the presence of the word "crack" (as a drug) would make it T. 

But I'm not 100% sure. However, given that "crack" is a slang term for the drug, and the phrase is using it, even if it's a metaphor, the label would be T. Alternatively, if the phrase is not referring to the drug, then it's F. 

But the user is asking to label based on the rules. The rules say T if the text shows drug use, including slang. So if the text uses "crack" as a slang term, then it's T. The phrase "crack our heads" might be a metaphor, but the presence of "crack" as a slang term would make it T. 

Alternatively, maybe "crack our heads" is a metaphor for something else, like causing problems, but the word "crack" is still a slang term. So the label would be T. 

But I'm not entirely certain. However, given the rules, I think the answer is T because "crack" is a slang term for the drug. So the label is T.
