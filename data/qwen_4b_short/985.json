Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "If Rue didn't get out Laurie was going to traffic her assuming she didn't when Rue was out on morphine #EuphoriaHBO".

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The mention of "Rue" and "Laurie" might refer to characters from the show "Euphoria". The key terms here are "traffic her" and "morphine". 

The label rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So I need to check if the post is discussing drug use in any of those ways.

"Traffic" in this context could be slang for trafficking drugs. "Morphine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. The phrase "out on morphine" suggests that Rue is under the influence or receiving morphine, which is a controlled substance. 

The sentence structure seems to be talking about Laurie planning to traffic Rue while she's on morphine. So "traffic" here is likely referring to drug trafficking. Also, "morphine" is a drug, so that's a direct mention of a drug. 

Therefore, the post is discussing drug trafficking (traffic) and the use of morphine, which are both T categories. The hashtag #EuphoriaHBO is just indicating the show, but the content itself is about drug use. 

I should check if there's any other possible interpretation. "Traffic" could be a verb meaning to move or transport, but in the context of drugs, it's commonly used as slang for trafficking. The mention of morphine is a drug. So the post is definitely T.
