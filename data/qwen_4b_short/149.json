Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is a quote from an article discussing increases in unintentional injury deaths in 2020, mostly due to drug overdoses. The article mentions final mortality data to assess the pandemic's effect on drug overdose trends.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key terms here are "drug overdose deaths." The article is talking about the causes of deaths, specifically drug overdoses. However, the post itself is a quote from an article, not a direct statement about drug use. It's discussing the data and trends related to drug overdoses as a cause of death. 

The label rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post here is reporting on the data, not the act of using or discussing drug use. It's more about the statistics and the impact of the pandemic on overdose deaths. There's no mention of using drugs, seeking them, buying, selling, etc. The term "overdose" is part of the cause of death, but the post isn't about the use of drugs itself. It's a news or data report. So according to the rules, this would be F, as it's a discussion about the effects of drug overdoses in a statistical context, not the act of drug use. Therefore, the label should be F.
