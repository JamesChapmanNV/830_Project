Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "brb, obtaining an Rx for heroin to treat my 'hysteria'". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about obtaining a prescription (Rx) for heroin to treat "hysteria". Heroin is an illicit drug, and getting a prescription for it would be related to drug use. The term "hysteria" here is probably a slang term, but even if it's a medical term, the main point is the mention of heroin. 

Wait, but is heroin being used here for medical purposes? The user mentions "treat my 'hysteria'". However, heroin is not typically prescribed for hysteria. But the key here is that the person is seeking to obtain a prescription for heroin, which is an illicit drug. Even if it's for a medical reason, the act of seeking a prescription for an illicit drug would still fall under T. Also, the use of "Rx" (prescription) might be a red flag. 

But wait, maybe the user is referring to a medical use, like in some cases, but heroin is not a standard medication. However, the label rules include "slang for drugs". So even if it's a medical context, the mention of heroin is still a drug. Also, the act of obtaining a prescription for it is seeking to use it, which is T. 

So the answer should be T. The post shows seeking to obtain a prescription for heroin, which is an illicit drug. Even if the reason is a medical condition, the act of seeking a prescription for an illicit drug is considered T.
