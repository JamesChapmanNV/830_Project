Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "swear my back has been worn away to dust, ive had bare codeine and it still feels like its in absolute bits :(".

First, I need to check the rules. The label is T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, the person mentions "bare codeine". Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. The phrase "bare codeine" might be a slang term, but I'm not sure. However, codeine is a drug that's used medically but also has potential for abuse. The person is talking about taking codeine and feeling that it's "in absolute bits", which might be a way of expressing that the drug isn't working or is causing some effect. The mention of "back has been worn away to dust" could be a metaphor, but the context of codeine use might indicate actual drug use.

Wait, the user is saying they've had "bare codeine" and it still feels like it's in bits. The term "bare codeine" could be a slang term for using codeine, maybe even in a way that's considered abusive. Also, the feeling described might be a side effect of using codeine, but the key here is whether the text shows drug use. Since codeine is a drug, and the person is talking about using it, this would fall under T. The other part about the back being worn away might be a metaphor, but the presence of codeine use is enough to label it as T. So the answer should be T.
