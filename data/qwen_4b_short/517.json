Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "The actual FACTS are that NEITHER autopsy report states that his death was from a overdose."

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

The post here is talking about autopsy reports not stating the cause of death was an overdose. The key words here are "autopsy report" and "overdose." Now, overdose can be related to drug use, but the post isn't directly stating that the person used drugs. It's more about the lack of information in the autopsy reports. The user is pointing out that the reports didn't mention overdose as the cause. 

But wait, the term "overdose" itself could be a slang for drug overdose. However, the post is not stating that the person used drugs; it's discussing the absence of that information in the reports. The user is presenting a fact about the reports, not necessarily the actual cause of death. So, is this a medical discussion or a news statement? The post is making a factual claim about the autopsy reports, which is a medical or policy-related topic. 

The rules say F includes medical/policy discussion. So even though "overdose" is related to drugs, the post isn't directly talking about drug use. It's more about the reports not indicating overdose. Therefore, the label should be F. Unless the post is trying to imply that the person died from drug overdose, but the wording is "NEITHER autopsy report states that his death was from a overdose." So it's not confirming the cause, just stating that the reports don't say that. Hence, no direct mention of drug use, so F.
