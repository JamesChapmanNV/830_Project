Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Wow imagine smoking this much crack and not dying. You're invincible (at least when it comes to smoking crack)".

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "smoking this much crack". The phrase "smoking crack" directly refers to using crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. The user is talking about smoking a lot of crack and not dying, which implies actual use. The mention of being invincible in the context of smoking crack is a metaphor, but the main action here is the use of the drug. 

The rules mention that even if it's a metaphor, if it's about drug use, it's T. However, the example given in the rules includes "metaphor" as F. Wait, the rules say F includes metaphor. So if the post is a metaphor, then it's F. But in this case, the post is not a metaphor. The person is talking about actually using crack, so it's a direct reference to drug use. 

But wait, the user says "imagine smoking this much crack and not dying" â€“ that's a hypothetical scenario, but the act of smoking crack is still drug use. The label rules say T includes "using", so even if it's hypothetical, if it's talking about using the drug, it's T. 

Alternatively, if the post was using "crack" as a metaphor for something else, then it would be F. But here, "crack" is clearly referring to the drug. So the answer should be T. 

But wait, the user's instruction says to return only T or F. So the correct label here is T because it's about using crack, which is an illicit drug. The mention of not dying and being invincible is part of the context of using the drug, so it's still T.
