Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a cannabis regulatory update, mentioning Nevada continuing weed arrests despite legalization and Missouri's efforts to legalize.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "weed arrests" and "legalization." The post is discussing regulatory changes and law enforcement actions related to cannabis. It doesn't mention actual use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Instead, it's talking about legal status and police actions. 

The label rules say T is for any text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. F is for other cases like medical, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. This post is a news update about regulatory changes and law enforcement responses, so it's not about the actual use of drugs. It's more about the policy and legal aspects. Therefore, the correct label should be F.
