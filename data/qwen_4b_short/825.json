Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone needing morphine for pain management. The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, the mention of "morphine" is a controlled substance, typically used medically. The context here is about managing pain, with a doctor's advice. The user is talking about using morphine for a few days, which is a medical use. The analogy to a fire is metaphorical, explaining the need to control pain. There's no mention of seeking, buying, selling, or slang related to drugs. The focus is on medical treatment under a doctor's guidance. So, according to the rules, since it's a medical discussion and not about abuse or illicit use, the label should be F. But I need to make sure there's no hidden slang or indication of abuse. The post seems straightforward, so F is correct.
