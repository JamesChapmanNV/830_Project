Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about opium being the source of various drugs like heroin, morphine, etc., and mentions chronic use causing permanent damage. The hashtag #CRJ107 and #DrugUseAndDelinquency are also there.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "opium," "heroin," "morphine," "paregoric," "codeine," and "chronic use." These are all directly related to drugs. The mention of chronic use leading to physiological damage is a clear indication of drug abuse. The hashtags are about drug use and delinquency, which are related to the topic. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't use slang, but it does discuss the sources of drugs and their effects. Since it's talking about the use and consequences of these drugs, it falls under T. The other cases (F) would be if it's medical discussion, policy, news, or discouraging use. Here, it's more about the effects of drug use, so it's T. The hashtags also reinforce the topic. So the answer should be T.
