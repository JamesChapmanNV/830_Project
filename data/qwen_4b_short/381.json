Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about U.S. new vehicle sales dropping 26% in September due to chip shortages and supply issues.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The keywords to look for are using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about vehicle sales, chip shortages, and supply chain disruptions. There's no mention of drugs or related terms. The topic is entirely about automotive sales and economic factors. 

Since the post doesn't include any drug-related content, the label should be F. The rules state that F is for all other cases, which includes medical/policy discussions, news, or discouraging use. This post is news-related, so it fits under F. I don't see any metaphors or drug slang here either. Just a straightforward report on vehicle sales. So the answer is F.
