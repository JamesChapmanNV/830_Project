Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Ninah is crazy ðŸ˜­ y'all crack me up cause you're the complete opposite".

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The labels T include text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the words used are "crazy" and "crack me up". "Crazy" is a general term and not specifically related to drugs. "Crack me up" is an idiom meaning to find something funny, so that's a metaphor. There's no mention of any drug-related terms here. The emojis are just expressive, not indicating drug use. 

The user is using "crazy" and "crack me up" as metaphors for being absurd or funny, not for drug use. So according to the rules, this doesn't fit T. Therefore, the label should be F.
