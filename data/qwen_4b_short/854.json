Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is in Hindi, so I need to understand what it's saying.

First, the post starts with "Dear is double-dealer." That might be a reference to someone being untrustworthy. Then it mentions "My loan repayment has been bounce because PhonePe." PhonePe is a mobile payment app, right? So maybe the person is saying their loan repayment was bounced due to an issue with PhonePe. Then they say "show me the right way, I want complain against."

Now, the rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

Looking at the post, there's no mention of drugs. The main issue here is about a loan repayment problem related to PhonePe. The user is complaining about a financial issue. There's no slang or mention of drugs. The term "double-dealer" might be metaphorical, but it's not related to drugs. So this should be labeled F. The user is seeking help with a financial complaint, not discussing drug use. Therefore, the answer is F.
