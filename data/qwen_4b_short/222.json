Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "Happy 420 Can't wait for cannabis to be legalized in Nigeria." The options are T or F. 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post starts with "Happy 420," which is a reference to April 20th, the Cannabis Day. Then the person is expressing excitement about the legalization of cannabis in Nigeria. Now, the key here is whether this is about drug use or just a discussion about legalization. 

The user is talking about the legalization of cannabis, which is a policy or legislative topic. They aren't discussing personal use, seeking, buying, or selling. They're talking about the legal status changing. So this would fall under F because it's about policy and not about drug abuse or use. 

But wait, I should check if "cannabis" is considered a drug here. Yes, cannabis is a drug, but the post isn't about using it. It's about the legalization. So even though cannabis is a drug, the context here is about policy, not abuse. Therefore, the label should be F.
