Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about the DRI arresting a businessman related to a drug case where 205.6 kg of heroin was seized. 

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "drug haul case" and "heroin seized." The DRI (Drug Rehabilitation Institute?) is involved, and the arrest is connected to the seizure of heroin. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention anyone using drugs, but it's about the arrest related to trafficking (since heroin was seized). However, the post itself is reporting on the arrest and the seizure, not directly stating that someone is using drugs. 

But wait, the case is about a "drug haul," which implies trafficking. The post is about the arrest in connection with that case. The main point is the seizure of heroin, which is an illicit drug. The post is reporting on the arrest related to trafficking, so does that count as T? The rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." Since the case involves trafficking (seizing heroin), the post is about that. But the label is for the text itself. The text is reporting on the arrest in connection with the drug haul case, which is trafficking. 

However, the post itself doesn't explicitly state that the businessman was using drugs, but rather that he was involved in trafficking. The label T is for text that shows drug use, etc. The post is about the arrest related to trafficking, so maybe it's T because it's related to drug trafficking. Alternatively, if the post is just reporting on the arrest without mentioning the act of using, maybe it's F. But the question is whether the text shows drug use. The post is about the arrest in connection with a drug case where heroin was seized. The term "drug haul case" refers to trafficking. So the text is about the trafficking, which is part of the drug abuse context. 

But according to the label rules, T is when the text shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post is about trafficking (seizing heroin), so the text is related to trafficking. Therefore, the label should be T. But wait, the post is reporting on the arrest, not the act of using. However, the case is about trafficking, which is part of the drug abuse context. So the answer is T.
