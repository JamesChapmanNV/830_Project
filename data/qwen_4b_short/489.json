Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a man in Calabasas who allegedly scammed investors out of $28 million they thought would fund cannabis vaping businesses.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post mentions "cannabis vaping businesses," which is related to cannabis, a drug. But the key here is whether the post itself is showing drug use. The main point is that the man scammed investors who thought the money would fund these businesses. The post is reporting on a scam related to cannabis businesses, not necessarily stating that the man is using drugs. 

The term "cannabis" is a drug, but the post is about a business venture, not about drug use. The investors were tricked into thinking their money would go into a cannabis business, but the actual issue is fraud, not drug use. The label is about whether the text shows drug use. Since the post is about a scam related to cannabis businesses, not about someone using drugs, it's more of a financial fraud story. Therefore, the label should be F because it's not about drug use but rather a business scam. The mention of cannabis is part of the business context, not the drug use itself.
