Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "#Baseball fans are junkies, and their heroin is the statistic."

First, I need to understand the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main elements are "junkies" and "heroin." "Junkies" is a slang term for people addicted to drugs, which fits under T. "Heroin" is an illicit drug, so that's also T. The phrase "their heroin is the statistic" is a bit confusing. It seems like a metaphor. Maybe the author is saying that baseball fans are addicted to the statistics of the game, using "heroin" as a metaphor for something they're addicted to. But the key here is whether the text is directly referring to drug use. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to check if the text shows drug use. The post uses "junkies" and "heroin," which are direct references to drugs. Even if it's a metaphor, the presence of the actual drug name (heroin) and the term "junkies" might still qualify as T. However, the metaphor part could be a stretch. But according to the rules, if the text uses slang or direct references to drugs, it's T. So even if it's a metaphor, the presence of "heroin" and "junkies" would make it T. 

Alternatively, maybe the author is using "heroin" as a metaphor for statistics. But the term "heroin" is a real drug, so the text is directly referring to it. Therefore, the label should be T. But I need to make sure that the post isn't just using metaphor. The phrase "their heroin is the statistic" is a bit unclear, but the presence of "heroin" as a drug name would still trigger the T label. 

So the answer is T.
