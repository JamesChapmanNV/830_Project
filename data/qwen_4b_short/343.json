Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a study on long-term cannabis users and their IQ decline, learning issues, and memory problems.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "cannabis users" and the effects mentioned. The study is discussing the impact of cannabis use over time. The question is whether this counts as T or F. 

The rules state T is for text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post here is talking about the effects of cannabis use, not necessarily the act of using it. It's a discussion about the consequences of long-term use. However, the main focus is on the outcomes of cannabis use, not the act itself. 

But wait, the post is reporting on a study that found negative effects. The label rules mention that T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." The text here is not explicitly about the act of using, but rather the results of long-term use. However, the mention of "long-term cannabis users" does imply that they are using cannabis. But the question is whether the text is showing drug use. 

Alternatively, the post is discussing the effects of cannabis use, which could be considered as T if the text is about drug use. However, the label F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor. The study is a news report on the effects, which might fall under F if it's not directly about the act of using but the consequences. 

Wait, the rules say T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." The post is not about the act of using, but the effects of using. So maybe it's F because it's discussing the consequences rather than the act itself. However, the presence of "cannabis users" might be considered as T. But the label F is for other cases. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is a medical discussion about the effects of cannabis, which would be F. The study is a medical or scientific report, so it's not directly about drug use but the effects. Therefore, the label should be F.
