Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says: "After two full hours of play, we finally got a new dealer at our table. He politely asked that players keep their 5K and 25K big chips visibleâ€¦ in front / up top. I let him know I like to keep mine in other player's stacks."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules are T for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main context is about a poker game. The mention of "dealer" here is probably referring to a poker dealer, not a drug dealer. The terms "5K and 25K big chips" are about poker chips, not drugs. The person is talking about keeping chips visible in front of them, which is a poker etiquette thing. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, selling, buying, trafficking, or any slang related to drugs. The word "dealer" in this context is part of the game, not related to drugs. So this doesn't fit the T category. Therefore, the label should be F.
