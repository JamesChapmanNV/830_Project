Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about Congress appointing negotiators to finalize a manufacturing bill that might include cannabis banking protections. The label rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use. The title mentions "Cannabis Banking Protections." Cannabis is a drug, but the context here is about a bill related to manufacturing and banking protections. The key here is whether the post is discussing the use of drugs. The term "cannabis" is a drug, but the post is about a legislative bill, not about using or selling drugs. It's more about policy and news. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The focus is on the manufacturing bill and possible protections for cannabis banking. So, this seems like a news headline about legislation, not about drug use. Therefore, the label should be F.
