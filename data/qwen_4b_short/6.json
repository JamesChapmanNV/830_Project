Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about prosecutors knowing George Floyd died from a drug overdose and linking it to political opportunism by Democrats. 

First, I need to check if the text mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key part here is "drug overdose." The term "overdose" is related to drug use, so that's a T. But wait, the context is about prosecutors and political motives. However, the label rules say T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use. The mention of overdose is a direct indicator of drug use, even if the rest of the post is about political reasons. 

But I need to make sure that the post isn't just discussing a medical or policy issue. The user's instruction says F is for medical/policy discussion, etc. However, the post is not just discussing the overdose itself but is making a claim about prosecutors' knowledge and political motives. However, the presence of "drug overdose" is still a T because it's about drug use. 

Wait, the label rules say T if the text shows drug use. The post does mention that Floyd died from a drug overdose, which is a direct reference to drug use. Even if the rest of the post is about political aspects, the presence of the drug-related term makes it T. So the label should be T.
