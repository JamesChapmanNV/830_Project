Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "These pharmacist should be punished for stealing beyond what was in the pocket. Otherwise they r not that bad since it wasn't overdose. Plus the patient must have called for their service."

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "stealing beyond what was in the pocket." Wait, "stealing" in this context might refer to something else. The user is talking about a pharmacist, so maybe they're referring to prescription drug theft? But the phrase "stealing beyond what was in the pocket" is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a metaphor or slang?

Looking at the other parts: "it wasn't overdose" and "patient must have called for their service." The mention of "overdose" could relate to drugs, but the main issue here is the pharmacist's actions. The user is talking about punishing the pharmacist for stealing, but the term "stealing" here might not directly relate to drug use. Instead, it might be about prescription drug abuse or theft, which is a medical or policy discussion. The post doesn't explicitly mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Instead, it's about a pharmacist's actions related to prescriptions. 

The rules say T is for text showing drug use, and F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion. The post seems to be discussing a medical or policy issue regarding a pharmacist's actions, not directly about drug use. The mention of "overdose" is there, but the context is about the pharmacist's behavior, not the patient's drug use. So, the label should be F because it's a discussion about a medical or policy issue rather than direct drug use. The user is talking about punishing a pharmacist for stealing, which is a policy or medical concern, not about the use of drugs. Therefore, the answer is F.
