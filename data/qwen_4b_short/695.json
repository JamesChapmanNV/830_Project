Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post "Put the crack pipe down and go to bed." as either T or F based on the given rules. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to analyze the sentence. The key words here are "crack pipe." Crack is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. A "pipe" in this context is a device used to smoke crack cocaine. So "crack pipe" refers to the use of a drug. The phrase "Put the crack pipe down" is a direct instruction to stop using the drug. 

The action here is "put down," which implies stopping the use. The presence of "crack pipe" clearly indicates drug use. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled T because it's directly related to drug use. There's no mention of medical advice, policy, news, or metaphor here. It's a direct reference to using an illicit drug. So the label should be T.
