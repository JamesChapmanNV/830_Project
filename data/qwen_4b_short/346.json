Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The user wants to know if the post is T or F. The post says, "Adults can't purchase heroin for themselves without going to prison or can't chop off their own limbs without being committed. Same thing here. Mental illness needs to be treated, not held up as normal."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The first part talks about purchasing heroin, which is a drug. The second part mentions chopping off limbs, which is a metaphor for self-harm, but not directly related to drug use. The main point is about mental illness being treated instead of normalized.

The key here is whether the post is about drug use. The first sentence directly mentions heroin, which is an illicit drug. So that's a T. The second part is about mental illness, which is F. But the user's instruction says to label based on drug-related content. The post is using heroin as an example to argue about mental illness. So even though the main topic is mental illness, the mention of heroin (a drug) would make it T. However, the second part is about mental illness, which is F. But the question is whether the post contains any drug use. The first part does, so the label should be T. Wait, but the user's rules say T if the text shows drug use. The post does mention heroin, which is a drug. So the answer is T. But the second part is about mental illness, which is F. However, the presence of any drug-related content in the text would make it T. So the answer is T.
