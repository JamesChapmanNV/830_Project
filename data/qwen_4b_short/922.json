Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Nothing better than the best sheriff to watch over the city like my husband David!" 

First, I need to check if this post mentions anything related to drug use. The label rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the main subject is a sheriff and the speaker's husband. The phrase "best sheriff to watch over the city" is a compliment. There's no mention of drugs, drug-related activities, slang, or any terms associated with drug use. The mention of "sheriff" is a public official, and "watch over the city" is a general statement about protection. 

I don't see any words or phrases that would indicate drug use. The sentence is positive and talks about a husband's role in the community. There's no metaphor here that relates to drugs. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's not related to drug abuse or illicit drug use. 

I should make sure I'm not missing any hidden meanings or slang. But "sheriff" is a common term, and the context is about a husband's role. No drug-related terms are present. So the answer is F.
