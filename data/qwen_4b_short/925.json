Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says: "im sorry to say this, i was devastated about it too. Its heroine, not heroin :(".

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user mentions "heroine, not heroin". Wait, heroine is a slang term for heroin, right? But in the post, they're clarifying that it's heroine (the drug) and not heroin. But wait, actually, heroine is the actual name of the drug, while heroin is a common name. Wait, no, I think there's a mix-up here. Wait, heroine is a slang term for heroin. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Heroin is a drug, and heroine is a slang term for it. But sometimes people confuse the two. However, in the post, the user is saying "Its heroine, not heroin :(" which might be a typo or confusion. But the key is whether the text is indicating drug use.

The user is talking about being devastated about something related to drugs. The mention of "heroine" (assuming that's the drug) would fall under T because it's referring to the drug. However, the user is clarifying that it's not heroin, which might be a typo or confusion. But regardless, the term "heroine" is a slang for heroin, which is an illicit drug. So the post is referring to drug use, so it should be labeled T. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a person's name, but "heroine" as a slang term for heroin is more likely. So the correct label here is T.
