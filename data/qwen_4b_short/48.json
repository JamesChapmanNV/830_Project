Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about the user's great aunt born in 1915 who visited from California. They played cards with her and their grandma, and they talked about the Great Depression.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs, drug use, or related terms. The post talks about playing cards, TV shows like Jeopardy, and discussing the Great Depression. There's no mention of drugs, drug slang, buying, selling, using, or anything related to drug abuse. The activities described are social and historical, not related to drug use. 

The rules state that T is for any text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. Since there's no mention of drugs here, it's F. The post is about family history and past events, so it's a different topic altogether. Therefore, the correct label should be F.
