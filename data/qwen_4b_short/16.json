Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "New 'fraught squad' will crack down on criminals who steal taxpayer money -" and I need to determine if it's a T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (all other cases).

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug-related terms. The key words here are "fraud squad" and "steal taxpayer money." The term "fraud squad" might be a bit confusing. Wait, "fraud" is not a drug, but maybe it's a slang term? But in this context, "fraud squad" is likely referring to a group that deals with fraud, not drugs. The rest of the sentence talks about criminals stealing taxpayer money, which is about financial crimes, not drug use. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, selling, buying, trafficking, or any slang related to drugs. The label is about whether the text shows drug use. Since there's no mention of drugs or related activities, the correct label should be F. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so unless there's a hidden slang or term I'm missing, this doesn't fit T. So the answer is F.
