Okay, let's see. The user provided a social media post that needs to be labeled as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Police, fuck the police I where cocaine, sippin codeine it's the same thing". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the text, the person mentions "cocaine" and "codeine". Both are drugs. The phrase "I where cocaine" might be a typo for "I was using cocaine" or "I was where cocaine", but the key part is the mention of cocaine. Then "sippin codeine" â€“ "sippin" is slang for drinking, so "sipping codeine" implies using codeine. 

The user is talking about using both cocaine and codeine, which are illicit drugs. Even though codeine is sometimes used medically, in this context, the person is using it, which would fall under abusive use. The mention of police and the expletive "fuck the police" might be part of the context but doesn't directly relate to the drug use. 

So, the presence of the drugs cocaine and codeine in the text clearly indicates T. The other parts of the post are just context or expression of frustration, but the key elements are the drugs. Therefore, the label should be T.
