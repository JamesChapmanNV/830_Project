Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "After 2 weeks of cash games I have this compulsion to tip the dealer with every pot I rake."

First, I need to understand what the rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

So the key here is to determine if the post relates to drug use. The post mentions "cash games," which I think refers to poker or similar games. The person is talking about a compulsion to tip the dealer after every pot they rake. The word "tip" here is likely in the context of gambling, not drugs. There's no mention of drugs, slang, or any activities related to drug use. The terms "cash games" and "tip the dealer" are related to gambling, not drug abuse. Therefore, this doesn't fit the T category. It's more of a personal anecdote about gambling behavior, which would fall under F. So the label should be F.
