Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Pour my codeine into a bigger hot New Orleans cream and sugar."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key term here is "codeine." Codeine is a controlled substance, classified as an opiate, and is used in medical contexts but also has potential for abuse. The phrase "pour my codeine into a bigger hot New Orleans cream and sugar" seems like a literal instruction, but I need to check if it's referring to actual drug use or a metaphor.

Wait, "New Orleans cream and sugar" might be a reference to a specific drink or a metaphor. However, the main focus here is "codeine." The act of pouring codeine into something could be interpreted as using or consuming it. But is this a direct mention of drug use? The user is specifying that T includes using, seeking, buying, etc. So if the post is about using codeine, then it's T. But is the context clear? The phrase "pour my codeine into..." sounds like someone is preparing to take codeine, possibly in a way that's not medical. However, codeine is sometimes used in medications, so maybe it's a metaphor. But the label rules don't mention medical use as F. Wait, the rules say F includes medical/policy discussion. So if the post is about medical use, it's F. But if it's about using it in a non-medical way, then T.

But the post is phrased as a command: "Pour my codeine into..." which might be a way of expressing that the person is using codeine, perhaps in a non-medical context. However, codeine is a controlled substance, and if someone is talking about using it, that would be T. Alternatively, maybe it's a metaphor for something else, like a drink. But the mention of codeine is a drug. So even if the rest is a drink, the presence of codeine would make it T. Because the rules include "slang for drugs" as T. So even if it's not a direct use, but mentioning the drug itself, it's T. Therefore, the label should be T.
