Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "I loved the Spiderman drug issues... Peter beats up the heroin dealers he caught selling to Harry..."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the main points are about Spiderman dealing with drug issues. The specific mention is "heroin dealers" and "selling to Harry." The key here is whether the text is directly about drug use or abuse. 

The phrase "heroin dealers" directly refers to people selling heroin, which is an illicit drug. The action of "beating up the heroin dealers" is about selling, which is part of the drug abuse context. The mention of "selling to Harry" indicates the act of trafficking or selling drugs. 

Even though the context is a movie reference, the actual content is about drug dealing. The user is talking about drug use in a narrative, which falls under the T category. The other cases (F) would be things like medical discussions or discouraging use, but here it's about the use and selling of drugs. 

So the label should be T.
