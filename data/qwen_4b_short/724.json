Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a medical examiner stating that if they found George Floyd home alone, they would conclude he had a fentanyl overdose. The hashtags include #DerekChauvinTrail, #GeorgeFloydIsNotOnTrial, Fentanyl, #Chauvin, #GeorgeFloyd.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key part here is "fentanyl overdose." Fentanyl is an illicit drug, so mentioning an overdose related to fentanyl would fall under T. The post is reporting a statement from a medical examiner, so it's not about personal use but rather a medical finding. However, the presence of fentanyl as a drug is still a direct reference to illicit drug use. The hashtags also include "Fentanyl," which is a drug. Even though the context is a medical report, the mention of fentanyl itself is a T. The other elements like the trial and legal hashtags don't affect the label here. So the answer should be T.
