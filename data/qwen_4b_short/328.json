Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about cryptocurrency and NFTs, talking about rewards for holders and a revamp of NFTs. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drugs or related terms. The post mentions "crypto" and "NFTs," which are related to digital assets, not drugs. The words "reward," "holders," "projects," "revamp," "toxic shell" are all related to cryptocurrency and blockchain, not drugs. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any slang related to drugs. The user is talking about crypto and NFTs, which are financial or technological topics. So, according to the rules, since there's no mention of drugs or drug-related terms, the label should be F. The post is discussing cryptocurrency, which is a financial topic, not related to drug abuse. Therefore, the correct label is F.
