Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post mentions someone dying from an overdose of drugs. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The phrase "over dose of drugs" directly indicates drug use, specifically overdose, which is related to drug abuse. Even though the rest of the post is about a video clip, the mention of overdose clearly falls under T. The other parts don't mention any other drug-related terms, so the main point here is the overdose. Therefore, the label should be T.
