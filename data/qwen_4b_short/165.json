Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a 420 day, which is a reference to cannabis, since 4/20 is a common date associated with cannabis culture. The user mentions #marihuana and #cannabis, and talks about artwork and NFTs related to that. 

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The terms used here are "marihuana" and "cannabis," which are drugs. The #420 is a reference to the 4/20 date, which is widely known as a cannabis holiday. The post is promoting the use of cannabis in artwork and NFTs. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Here, the post is discussing the use of cannabis, even if it's in a cultural or artistic context. The mention of #marihuana and #cannabis directly refers to the drug. Even though it's not explicitly about using it, the presence of the drug names and the context of the 4/20 date, which is associated with cannabis, would fall under T. 

However, I need to make sure that it's not just a metaphor. The user mentions "droped today" which might refer to a release of NFTs related to cannabis. But the main point is the mention of the drugs themselves. The labels F are for medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. Since the post is promoting cannabis in a cultural context, it's more about the drug itself, so it should be T. 

Wait, but the user also says "Label rules T â€“ text shows illicit or abusive drug use..." So if the post is about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post is about the 4/20 day, which is a celebration of cannabis use. The mention of #marihuana and #cannabis are direct references to the drug. Therefore, this should be labeled T.
