Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is in Filipino, so I need to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, the post mentions "my first ever photocard was Suho from their overdose album which is 6 years ago..." Wait, Suho is a K-pop idol, and "overdose album" might be a reference to a music album. But the key part here is "overdose album." However, "overdose" in this context is likely a slang term for a K-pop group, not related to drug use. The user is talking about a photocard (a collectible card) of a singer from an album. Then they mention being 18 and missing their original girl group members.

Looking at the rules, T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including slang for drugs. The post doesn't mention any drugs, drug use, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang related to drugs. The mention of "overdose" here is probably a reference to a group name or a term in the K-pop industry, not actual drug use. The rest of the post is about being a fan, collecting photocards, and missing past group members. There's no mention of drug-related activities. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's about a girl group and photocard collecting, not drug use. The user might be confusing "overdose" with a group name, but since there's no actual drug reference, it's F.
