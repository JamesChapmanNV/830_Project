Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about heroin use, mentioning 2 kilos of heroin, Nagaens (I think that's a typo for "Nagas" or maybe a specific group?), and people putting three tablespoons on their thigh. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, the mention of heroin is definitely a drug. The post talks about "2 kilos of heroin" which is a large amount, and "strapping three tablespoons on their inside thigh" â€“ that's a method of using drugs, injecting or maybe inhaling. The phrase "each drop adds up into an ocean" is a metaphor, but the main point is the actual drug use described. The user is talking about people using heroin in a way that's clearly abusive. The narrative is about the impact of drug use, but the key is whether the text shows the use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post is describing the use (using heroin, putting it on the thigh), so that's a T. The other parts are more about the consequences or the scale, but the main action is drug use. So the label should be T.
