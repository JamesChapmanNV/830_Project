Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a football player, Pickens, and the Steelers coaching staff. The user mentions that the person is a "hungry guy" and talks about his performance in run blocking. There's also a mention of the Steelers taking Watson, but the user is shocked they took Watson instead of Pickens.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The post talks about a player's performance, his skills, and team decisions. The phrase "hungry guy" might be a metaphor for being driven or motivated, not necessarily related to drugs. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The discussion is about sports, specifically football, and player evaluations. 

The labels T and F are for drug-related content. Since there's no mention of drugs or anything related to drug use, this should be labeled F. The user is discussing a sports topic, not drug abuse. Even though "hungry guy" could be a slang term, in this context, it's more likely a metaphor for being hungry to perform, not related to drugs. So the answer should be F.
