Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a Daikin AC leaking and some issues with installation. The person mentions talking to the area manager, Aakash, and had DM'd details 22 hours ago. They're asking if there's a resolution or if they should arrange their own service.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post is about a home appliance problem, specifically an AC unit. The keywords here are "leaking," "installation," "service," and "faulty." There's no mention of drugs or related terms. The mention of "DMd" is just a reference to direct messaging, which is common in social media. The hashtag #Daikin is related to the product, not drugs. 

The rules say T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. Since the post is about a faulty AC and customer service, there's no indication of drug-related content. The user is seeking resolution for a product issue, not discussing drugs. Therefore, this should be labeled F. I don't see any drug-related terms or references here. The answer is F.
