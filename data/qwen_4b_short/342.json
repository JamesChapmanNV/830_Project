Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "lol you're the one who said they don't crack 20 likes and you brought it up, not me üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è". 

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The mention of "crack 20 likes" might be a bit confusing. "Crack" here could be a slang term. Wait, "crack" can refer to the drug crack, which is a form of cocaine. But in this context, maybe it's a typo or a different usage. Let me think. If someone says "crack 20 likes," maybe they're talking about getting 20 likes on a social media post, but using "crack" as a slang term for something else.

But the user is moderating for drug abuse. The label rules are T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

So, the key here is whether "crack" is being used as slang for drugs. If "crack" is referring to the drug, then it's T. But if it's a typo or a different meaning, maybe not. However, "crack" is a known slang term for the drug crack cocaine. So if someone says "crack 20 likes," they might be using "crack" as a slang term for the drug. But the phrase "crack 20 likes" is a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo for "get 20 likes," but the user might be using "crack" as a slang term here.

Alternatively, maybe the person is talking about getting 20 likes, but the word "crack" is being used in a different context. However, given the rules, if "crack" is a slang term for drugs, then it would be T. But I need to be careful. Let me check the exact wording again. The post says "they don't crack 20 likes." If "crack" is used here as a verb meaning to get or obtain, then it's not related to drugs. But if "crack" is used as a slang term for the drug, then it's T. 

But in the context of social media, "crack" might be used as a typo for "crack" as in the drug. However, the phrase "crack 20 likes" is a bit unclear. Maybe the user is referring to something else. Alternatively, maybe "crack" is being used in a different way, like a joke. But given the rules, if "crack" is a slang term for drugs, then it's T. However, the presence of the emoji üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (which is a walking person) might be a red herring. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is talking about a social media post where someone is trying to get 20 likes, and the person is saying that they didn't start it. But the key is whether "crack" is a slang term for drugs. If the user is using "crack" as a slang term for the drug, then it's T. But if it's a typo or a different meaning, then it's F. 

I think the safest approach here is to check if "crack" is a slang term for drugs. Since "crack" is a known slang term for the drug, and if that's the case, then the post would be T. However, the phrase "crack 20 likes" is a bit odd. Maybe the user meant "get 20 likes," but the use of "crack" might be a typo. But without more context, I have to go with the information given. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using "crack" in a non-drug context, like a typo for "crack" as in a verb meaning to break or to get. But in that case, it's not related to drugs. However, the presence of the word "crack" in the post might be a red flag. 

Given the label rules, if "crack" is a slang term for drugs, then it's T. Otherwise, F. Since "crack" is a slang term for the drug, I think the label should be T. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is using "crack" in a different way. But given the rules, I need to decide based on the presence of drug-related terms. 

So, the answer would be T because "crack" is a slang term for the drug. However, the phrase "crack 20 likes" is a bit confusing. But the key is the presence of the term "crack" as a slang for drugs. Therefore, the label is T.
