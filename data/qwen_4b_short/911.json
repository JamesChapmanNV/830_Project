Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "i would never give a bitch the satisfaction of bein able to hold that over my head. i sell crack first". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the person says they "sell crack first". The word "crack" is a slang term for a type of illicit drug. Selling crack would fall under drug trafficking or selling, which are part of the T category. 

Also, the first part of the sentence is about not letting someone hold something over their head, which might be a metaphor, but the key part here is the mention of selling crack. 

So, even though the first part might be metaphorical, the second part clearly states selling crack, which is a drug. Therefore, the label should be T.
