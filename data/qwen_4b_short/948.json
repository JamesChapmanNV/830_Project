Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on whether it mentions drug use. The post here is about sports, specifically talking about a player named Willis being drafted by teams like Atlanta, Seattle, or New Orleans, and mentions "extra blue chip players" in the context of being up at 20. 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs, drug use, slang, or related terms. The words here are "blue chip player," which is a sports term referring to a high-potential athlete. There's no mention of drugs, using, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang related to drugs. The conversation is purely about sports drafts and player evaluations. 

The label rules say T if it's about drug use, otherwise F. Since there's no drug-related content here, it should be F. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden metaphors or slang. But "blue chip" in sports is a standard term, not a drug slang. So the answer is F.
