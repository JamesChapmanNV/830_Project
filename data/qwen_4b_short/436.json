Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "he gets his WHAT from california? omg omg omg shawn do you really smoke weed? tell us this is not true tell us this is fabricated this is not good for your health we care about u we cant lose u because of an overdose or something like that even if I'm just a fan to u, u mean so-"

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The user is asking if Shawn really smokes weed. "Smoke weed" is a slang term for using marijuana, which is an illicit drug. The mention of "overdose" could be relevant, but overdose is more related to opioids, but in this context, it's possible they're referring to marijuana. However, the main point here is the direct mention of smoking weed. 

The post also includes phrases like "tell us this is not true" and "this is not good for your health," which are related to discouraging use, but the key part is the question about smoking weed. Since the post directly mentions the use of drugs (weed), it should be labeled T. The other parts are about caring and health, but the core issue is the drug use. So the answer should be T.
