Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about advocating for the legalization of drugs like cocaine, heroin, and LSD, mentioning that they should be available in drug stores and that fentanyl shouldn't be present. The user also mentions prohibition as a crime and that all substances should be legal.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post talks about buying cocaine, heroin, and LSD, which are all illicit drugs. The mention of selling and trafficking isn't explicit here, but the main point is about buying them. The user is discussing the legalization of these substances, which are considered illegal. The presence of terms like "buy" and "legalization" might fall under the T category because it's about drug use. However, the rules also mention that F includes medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. 

But the post is not just discussing the effects or medical aspects. It's more about the availability and legalization of these drugs. The key here is whether the text is showing drug use. The user is talking about buying them, which is a form of drug use. Even though they're advocating for legalization, the act of buying is part of the drug use. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled as T. The mention of fentanyl is a specific concern, but the main focus is on the drugs themselves. So the answer is T.
