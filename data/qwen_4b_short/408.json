Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the FDA and U.S. government equate cannabis with heroin. The post also mentions "white wash house," which is a slang term for the government. But the main question is about whether they're equating cannabis and heroin.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The user is talking about cannabis and heroin, which are both drugs. However, the post is a question about government policy, not about using or discussing drug use in a way that's directly related to illicit use. The user is questioning the government's stance, but not engaging in the actual use or discussion of drugs in a way that would fall under T. 

The term "white wash house" is a metaphor for the government, so that's not a direct slang for drugs. The post is more about policy and perception rather than actual drug use. Therefore, the label should be F because it's a discussion about government policy and not directly about drug use or slang.
