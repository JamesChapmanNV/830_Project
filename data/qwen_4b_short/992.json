Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "Baby I can't quit that lean put a ring around codeine". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to break down the sentence. The mention of "lean" could be a slang term. I remember that "lean" is sometimes used as a slang term for cocaine, especially in some regions. Then "codeine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. The phrase "put a ring around" might be a metaphor, but in this context, it's likely referring to something related to the drug. 

The user is saying they can't quit "that lean" and want to "put a ring around codeine". The verbs "can't quit" and "put a ring around" might be part of a song lyric or a slang expression. Since "lean" is a drug slang and "codeine" is a drug, this post is clearly discussing drug use. The person is struggling with using codeine and leaning (cocaine), which fits the T category. There's no mention of medical advice or policy discussion here. So the label should be T.
