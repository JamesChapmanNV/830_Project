Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I've seen M91's in dealer hands in Texas." 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

So, the key here is to determine if the post relates to drug use. The term "M91" is mentioned. Wait, M91... I think that's a slang term for methamphetamine. Meth is a controlled substance, so if someone is referring to M91 as a drug, that would be a T. But I need to confirm if "M91" is indeed a slang term for meth. 

Alternatively, maybe "M91" refers to something else. Let me think. In some contexts, "M91" could be a model of a firearm, but the context here is dealer hands in Texas. If it's a firearm, then that's not related to drugs. However, if "M91" is slang for meth, then it's T. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the user is referring to a specific slang term. Let me check. Wait, in some drug slang, "M91" is a term used for methamphetamine. For example, "M91" is a slang term for meth. So if the post is talking about seeing M91 in dealer hands, that would indicate that the dealer is using or dealing with meth, which is an illicit drug. Therefore, this would be a T.

Alternatively, if "M91" is not a slang term but something else, like a model, then it's F. But given the context of dealers in Texas, and the mention of "dealer hands," it's more likely that "M91" refers to a drug. So the label should be T.
