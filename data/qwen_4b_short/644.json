Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight. Percocet & codeine please don't take my life üôèüèª". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, there's mention of "Percocet" and "codeine". Both of these are opioid medications, which are controlled substances. Percocet is a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen, and codeine is an opioid used in medications. However, the user is using them in a context that seems to be a plea not to take their life. The phrase "please don't take my life" might be a metaphor, but the mention of the drugs could indicate that the person is struggling with addiction. 

But according to the rules, I need to check if the text shows drug use. The presence of the drug names (Percocet, codeine) would fall under T because they are drugs. Even if the context is a plea, the actual mention of the drugs would trigger the T label. The other part about birds in the trap and Brian McKnight might be a metaphor or unrelated, but the drugs are explicitly mentioned. 

So, the label should be T because the text includes specific drug names, which are considered illicit or abusive drug use.
