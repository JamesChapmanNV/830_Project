Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Clout really hit society like crack in the 80s."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

So the post compares "clout" to "crack in the 80s." Crack is a slang term for a type of cocaine, which is an illicit drug. The phrase "crack in the 80s" is a well-known reference to the crack epidemic during that time. But here, the user is using "clout" as a metaphor. "Clout" typically means influence or power, so the comparison is metaphorical, not literal. The post isn't discussing actual drug use but using crack as a metaphor to describe the impact of clout on society.

Since the post is using a metaphor and not directly referring to drug use, it should be labeled F. The key here is whether the text is showing drug use. Since it's a metaphor, it's not T. Therefore, the correct label is F.
