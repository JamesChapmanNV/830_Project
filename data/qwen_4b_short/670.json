Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "IM SERIOUS MOM, IM TELLING THE TRUTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [ huge voice crack there lmao ]". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules for T are if the text mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The label F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user is shouting "IM SERIOUS MOM, IM TELLING THE TRUTH" with a lot of exclamation marks and a voice crack. There's no mention of drugs, drug-related activities, or any slang related to drugs. The content seems to be someone expressing seriousness or truth, possibly in a humorous or exaggerated way. The voice crack is just a sound effect, not indicating drug use. 

Since there's no mention of drugs or drug-related terms, the label should be F. The user isn't discussing drug use, selling, buying, or any related activities. The message is more about the person being serious or truthful, which doesn't fit the T criteria. Therefore, the correct label is F.
