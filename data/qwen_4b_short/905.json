Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Dealpain - Actiq Fentanyl Lollipop not meant for non-cancer". 

First, I need to understand what the label rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the main terms here are "Dealpain", "Actiq Fentanyl Lollipop", and "not meant for non-cancer". 

"Actiq Fentanyl Lollipop" is a medication that contains fentanyl, which is a powerful opioid. However, it's specifically approved for certain medical uses, like managing severe pain in cancer patients. The phrase "not meant for non-cancer" suggests that it's not intended for use by people who don't have cancer. 

Now, the question is whether this post is indicating drug use or abuse. The term "Dealpain" might be a slang term, but I'm not sure. However, the main focus here is on the product name and its intended use. The post is stating that the lollipop isn't meant for non-cancer patients. 

But wait, is there any mention of using or seeking the drug? The post is more about the product's intended use rather than promoting or discussing its use. It's a warning about the drug's appropriate use. However, the presence of fentanyl, which is an illicit drug, might be a factor. 

But according to the rules, T includes slang for drugs. However, the post isn't using slang; it's stating a fact about the product's intended use. The mention of fentanyl is a drug, but the post isn't about using it, seeking it, buying, selling, etc. It's more about the product's medical indication. 

So, the label would be F because it's not discussing drug use but rather the medical use of a drug. However, I need to be careful. If the post is implying that the drug is being used for non-cancer purposes, which is illegal, but the post itself is stating that it's not meant for non-cancer patients. 

Wait, the post is a warning. It's not promoting use, but rather stating that it's not for non-cancer patients. So it's not about drug use but about the product's intended use. Therefore, it's F. 

But maybe "Dealpain" is a slang term. If "Dealpain" refers to dealing with pain, which could be a slang for drug use, but I'm not sure. However, the main term here is Actiq Fentanyl Lollipop, which is a prescription drug. The post is stating that it's not meant for non-cancer patients. So, this is more of a medical warning, hence F.
