Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "i imagine heroin feeling like calling someone back and them not answering". 

First, I need to check if this text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The word "heroin" is definitely a drug. The phrase "feeling like calling someone back and them not answering" is a metaphor. The person is using a metaphor to describe the feeling of heroin, not actually using it. 

So, the key here is whether the text is about drug use itself or just a metaphor. Since the user is imagining the experience of using heroin, but not actually using it, it's a metaphor. The label should be F because it's not showing the actual use but rather a metaphorical description. The rules state that F includes metaphor, so this should be F.
