Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The user is asking me to determine if the given social media post falls under category T (indicating drug use) or F (other cases). The post is: "Then why would you think people would be stroking furry walls if you were in that culture as you put it iv never had cannabis ever make me feel that way".

First, I need to parse the text carefully. The key terms here are "stroking furry walls" and "cannabis". The user is responding to someone else's comment about a culture where people might engage in certain behaviors, like stroking furry walls. The user then says they've never had cannabis make them feel that way.

Now, I need to check if there's any explicit mention of drug use. The word "cannabis" is clearly a drug. However, the context here is about the effect of cannabis. The user is saying that cannabis never made them feel a certain way, which is a personal experience related to drug use. But the question is whether the post itself is showing illicit or abusive drug use. 

The label T requires that the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post mentions cannabis, which is a drug, but the user is not explicitly stating they are using it. They are talking about their personal experience with cannabis not making them feel a certain way. There's no direct indication of current use, seeking, or any other drug-related activity. The mention of "cannabis" is part of a discussion about its effects, not necessarily an act of using it. 

Additionally, the phrase "stroking furry walls" is a bit unclear. It might be a metaphor or a reference to a specific cultural context, but it's not directly related to drug use. The main point here is the mention of cannabis. However, since the user is not engaging in the act of using it but rather discussing its effects, this might fall under F. 

Wait, but the label T includes "slang for drugs". Is "cannabis" considered slang here? Well, "cannabis" is the common name for the drug, so it's not slang. The user is using the term "cannabis" which is a direct reference to the drug. However, the post is not showing the act of using it. It's more about the user's personal experience with the drug. 

So, the key is whether the text shows the act of using, seeking, buying, etc. Since the user is not doing any of those actions, but just discussing their experience, it might be F. However, the presence of "cannabis" could be a red flag. But according to the rules, T is when the text shows the act of drug use. If the text is just talking about the drug without using it, then it's F. 

Therefore, the label here should be F because the post is discussing cannabis but not showing any actual use or related activity. The user is talking about their personal experience with the drug, not using it. So the correct label is F.
