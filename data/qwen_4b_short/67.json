Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "My new sounds: Codeine Boy Da BeatDealer - 5228 [Demo]". The label rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to parse the post. The main elements here are "Codeine Boy" and "Da BeatDealer". The user is talking about "sounds" which might refer to music or audio files. The title includes "Codeine Boy", which could be a reference to a person or a song. But wait, "Codeine" is a drug, right? It's an opioid, used illicitly. However, the term "Codeine Boy" might be a name or a metaphor. 

But the label is about whether the text shows drug use. So, if "Codeine Boy" is a person's name, maybe a musician or artist, then it's not directly about drug use. However, if "Codeine Boy" is a slang term or a reference to someone using codeine, then it might be T. But I need to check if "Codeine Boy" is a known slang term. 

Alternatively, "Da BeatDealer" â€“ "BeatDealer" could be a nickname, maybe a rapper or a person known for beats. But "BeatDealer" isn't a slang term for drugs. However, "Beat Dealer" might be a play on words. Wait, "Beat Dealer" could be a reference to someone who deals beats (in music), but not necessarily drugs. 

But the key here is "Codeine Boy". Since codeine is a controlled substance, if the name is a reference to someone using codeine, then it's T. However, if it's just a name, then maybe not. But the user is sharing "sounds" which might be music. So, if the name is a reference to a person named Codeine Boy, then it's not directly about drug use. However, if the name is a slang term for someone using codeine, then it's T. 

But I think in this context, "Codeine Boy" is more likely a name or a musical reference rather than a direct reference to drug use. Unless the post is explicitly mentioning using codeine. But the post is about "sounds" and the title, not the content of the music. 

Wait, the label is about the text showing drug use. So if the text includes the name of a drug, like "codeine", then it's T. But "Codeine Boy" is a name, so maybe not. But the term "Codeine" is a drug, so if the name is a reference to someone using codeine, then it's T. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using "Codeine Boy" as a metaphor or a creative name. In that case, it's F. But I need to check if "Codeine Boy" is a known slang term. 

Looking up, "Codeine Boy" might be a reference to a person, but not necessarily a slang term. However, "Codeine" itself is a drug. If the post is using "Codeine Boy" as a name, then it's not directly showing drug use. However, if the name is a reference to someone using codeine, then it's T. 

But the label rules are about the text showing drug use. The presence of the word "codeine" in the title could be considered as showing drug use. However, if it's part of a name, maybe not. 

Wait, the user is moderating social media posts for drug abuse. So if the text includes the name of a drug, even in a name, it's considered T. Because "Codeine" is a drug. So even if it's part of a name, like "Codeine Boy", the text shows the drug's name, so it's T. 

But I need to be careful. For example, if someone's name is "Codeine", that's a name, but if they're using it as a slang term, then it's T. But in this case, the post is about "sounds" and a demo. The name "Codeine Boy" might be a creative name, but the presence of "codeine" in the title could be considered as showing drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using "Codeine Boy" as a metaphor for something else. But according to the rules, if the text includes the drug's name, even in a name, it's T. So I think the answer here is T because "Codeine" is a drug and is part of the title. However, if the name is not a direct reference to drug use, then maybe F. 

But the label rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs". So if the text includes the drug's name, even as part of a name, it's T. Therefore, the label should be T.
