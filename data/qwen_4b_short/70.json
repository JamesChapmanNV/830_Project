Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Sask. man fighting to get another patient's drug overdose removed from his health record".

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the main subject is a man in Saskatchewan fighting to remove a drug overdose from another patient's health record. The key terms here are "drug overdose" and "health record". The post is about a legal or medical issue regarding a patient's health record, not about the man using drugs himself. There's no mention of him using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking drugs. The focus is on the removal of the overdose record, which is a medical or policy-related issue. 

So, the post is discussing a medical case where a patient's drug overdose is in their record, and someone is trying to remove it. This seems like a medical or policy discussion, not about the use of drugs. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F. The terms used are not slang or indicative of drug use by the person in the post. The man is the one fighting to remove the record, but it's about another patient's overdose, not his own use. Hence, the label should be F.
