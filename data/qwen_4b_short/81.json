Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about Cann-ID® and their solution combining NFTs, COAs, marketing, and limited edition art in the cannabis industry. The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: It talks about Cann-ID® offering a solution that uses NFTs, COAs (Certificate of Analysis?), marketing, and limited edition art in the cannabis industry. The mention of cannabis testing COAs and blockchain applications seems to be about the cannabis industry's technological solutions. There's no direct mention of drug use, selling, or slang. The terms used are more about business strategies, technology, and industry solutions. Even though cannabis is mentioned, the context here is about the industry's operations rather than drug abuse. The post doesn't indicate any illicit activity or drug use. Therefore, it's likely an F. But I need to make sure there's no hidden slang or metaphor. The term "Cann-ID" might be a brand name, and "cannabis" is the product, but the focus is on the solution and technology. So the answer should be F.
