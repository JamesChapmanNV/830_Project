Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Friday's seizure is the third such haul in two weeks. A container was filled with yarn, but an examination showed that the threads were laced with a heroin derivative."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the key parts are "seizure," "haul," "yarn," and "heroin derivative." The term "seizure" here is likely referring to a law enforcement action, like seizing drugs. "Haul" in this context probably means a large quantity of drugs. The yarn is a cover, and the threads were found to have a heroin derivative. 

Heroin is an illicit drug, so the presence of a heroin derivative would fall under T. The post is reporting on the discovery of drugs in a container that was disguised as yarn. This is about drug trafficking or distribution, which is directly related to drug abuse. The mention of a heroin derivative is a clear indicator of drug use. 

I don't see any mention of medical use, policy discussion, or metaphors here. The post is factual, reporting on the seizure of drugs. Therefore, the correct label should be T.
