Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, including medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

Looking at the post: "Dying in a hospital can take many days. Opioid pain medications, like morphine, can cause a patient to not be cognizant of who is caring for them, or who is visiting them. How many can, or need to stay by the death-bed of a slowly dying sibling? #Trump does have a job, you know."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, slang, or related activities. The first sentence talks about dying in a hospital, which is general. The second sentence mentions opioid pain medications like morphine. Opioids are drugs, but here they're being discussed in the context of medical use (pain medication). The third sentence is about family care around death. The hashtag is about Trump having a job, which is unrelated.

The key here is whether the post is about drug use. The mention of opioids is a drug, but it's in the context of medical treatment. The post is explaining how opioids can affect a patient's awareness, not about using or seeking drugs. The hashtag is a separate, unrelated comment. So, the main content is about medical aspects of opioids, not drug abuse. Therefore, the label should be F because it's discussing medical use, not illicit drug use. The hashtag is a separate point but doesn't relate to the main content. So, the answer is F.
