Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "mum's accusing me of stealing an entire box of codeine hahahaha that shit's gross no ty". The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, or F for other cases.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key terms here are "codeine". Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance, so that's definitely a drug. The user's mom is accusing them of stealing a box of codeine. Stealing codeine would be related to drug trafficking or possession, which are forms of illicit drug use. The mention of "that shit's gross" is a slang expression, but the main point is the codeine. The phrase "no ty" is probably a typo or slang, but not directly related to drugs. 

So the post is about someone being accused of stealing codeine, which is a drug. That fits under T because it's related to drug use (stealing, possession). Even though the person is being accused, the content is about drug-related activity. Therefore, the label should be T.
