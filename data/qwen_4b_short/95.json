Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about a video related to a Limited Edition Black Falcon, mentioning it's sold out and not available from a local dealer anymore. The user wants to know if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to check the label rules. T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: "Falcon Friday ðŸ¦…" â€“ Falcon Friday is a common social media hashtag, often used by retailers to promote products, especially in the context of gaming or collectibles. The mention of "Evil Twin" might be a reference to a video game or a product name, not related to drugs. The video was created for the launch of a Limited Edition Black Falcon in 2015. It's sold out and not available from a local dealer, but they're keeping followers updated on a new version.

There's no mention of drugs, slang, selling, buying, or any related terms. The post is about a product launch and availability, which is a business or product announcement. The term "dealer" here is likely referring to a retail store or a sales outlet, not a drug dealer. The context is about a product, not drug use. 

So, based on the rules, this doesn't fit T. The label should be F.
