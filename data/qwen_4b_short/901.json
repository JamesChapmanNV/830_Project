Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about fentanyl being prescribed multiple times a year in various forms. The rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use. The post talks about fentanyl being prescribed in different forms. It's providing information about medical uses, like oral lozenges, buccal tablets, etc. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. It's more about the medical aspects and statistics. The fact that it's prescribed for medical purposes doesn't indicate illicit use. The mention of different forms is just about how it's administered, not about using it illegally. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's a medical/policy discussion. The user is providing factual information about prescription practices, not promoting or discussing drug abuse. So the answer is F.
