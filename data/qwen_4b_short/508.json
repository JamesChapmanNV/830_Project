Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "I'm in love with Mary Jane and codeine I don't love these hoesss". 

First, I need to break down the post. The key terms here are "Mary Jane" and "codeine". "Mary Jane" is a slang term for marijuana, right? So that's a drug reference. Then there's "codeine", which is an opioid, a type of illicit drug. The person is saying they're in love with both of these, which suggests they might be using them. The last part is "I don't love these hoesss"â€”the "hoesss" at the end might be a typo or a slang term. Maybe "hosses" is meant to be "hosses" as in "hosses" (plural of hoss), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, "hoesss" could be a misspelling of "hooches", which is slang for something else, but I'm not sure. However, the main points here are "Mary Jane" and "codeine", which are both drugs. 

The rules say T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So "Mary Jane" is a slang term for marijuana, which is a drug. "Codeine" is a controlled substance, often used illicitly. The person is talking about being in love with them, which could imply use. The "hoesss" might be a typo, but even if it's not, the presence of "codeine" and "Mary Jane" is enough to label this as T. The rest of the post is about love, but the drugs are the key here. So the answer should be T.
