Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "So! You're actually a confessed drug dealer & or connected????
Makes sense now!" 

First, I need to understand the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is accusing someone of being a "confessed drug dealer" and asking if they're connected. The use of "confessed drug dealer" is a direct reference to someone involved in selling drugs. The word "dealer" here is key. In the context of drug abuse moderation, "dealer" would fall under the T category because it's directly related to selling drugs, which is illicit.

Additionally, the exclamation marks and the rhetorical question "Makes sense now!" suggest a confrontational tone, but the main point is the accusation of being a drug dealer. There's no mention of using drugs, seeking them, buying, or any slang terms. The focus is on the act of selling, which is part of the trafficking or selling category. 

I should check if there's any possible metaphor or if it's a medical discussion. The post doesn't seem to be metaphorical. It's a direct accusation, so it's clearly related to drug abuse. Therefore, the label should be T.
