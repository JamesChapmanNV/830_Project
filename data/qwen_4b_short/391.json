Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post: the hashtags are #cannabiscommunity, #marijuana, #cannabis. Then there's a mention of Brilliant Miller releasing a video podcast interview with David Henkin, labeled as a World News Report. The School for Good Living Logo and headshots are mentioned. 

First, I need to check if the post is about drug use. The hashtags are related to cannabis and marijuana, which are drugs. But the content here is about a podcast interview, possibly discussing cannabis. However, the key is whether the post itself is showing drug use. The post is about a news report, so it's more about news or a discussion around cannabis. The hashtags are part of the community, but the actual content is about an interview. 

The rules mention that T is for text that shows drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, etc. The post here is about a news report, not directly about using or seeking drugs. It's more of a news headline or announcement. The mention of cannabis is part of the topic, but the post itself isn't indicating that someone is using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking drugs. It's just announcing an interview. 

Therefore, according to the rules, this would be F because it's a news report or a discussion about cannabis, not showing illicit drug use. The hashtags are related to cannabis, but the content isn't about the use of drugs. The post is about a podcast interview, which is a news or media-related topic, not directly about drug use. So the label should be F.
