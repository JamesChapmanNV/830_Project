Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about U.S. new vehicle sales dropping 26% in September due to chip shortages and supply issues.

First, I need to check if the post mentions anything related to drug use. The keywords here are "illicit or abusive drug use," which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about vehicle sales, chip shortages, and supply chain disruptions. There's no mention of drugs at all. The topic is completely about automotive sales and supply chain problems. 

The label rules say T if it's about drug use, otherwise F. Since there's no drug-related content here, it's F. I should make sure there's no hidden slang or metaphor. The words "chip shortages" and "supply disruptions" are business terms, not related to drugs. So the answer is F.
