Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about a cannabis farm's bookings opening on 4/20. The rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use. The post says "cannabis farm bookings open tomorrow" and mentions 4/20, which is a reference to cannabis culture. The key here is whether the post is about drug use. The main point is about a farm opening, which is a business venture. The mention of cannabis is the product, but the post is about bookings and availability, not about using or seeking drugs. 

The term "cannabis" is a slang term for marijuana, which is a drug. But the context here is about a farm, so it's more about the product being sold, not the use. The post doesn't mention using, buying, selling, or trafficking. It's more of a news or event announcement. The 4/20 reference is a cultural event, but not directly about drug use. 

So according to the rules, since the post is about a cannabis farm's bookings and not about using, seeking, buying, etc., it should be labeled F. Unless the term "cannabis" is considered slang for drugs, but the post is about the farm, not the use. Therefore, the label is F.
