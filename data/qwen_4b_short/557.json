Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "üá∫üá∏ Thanks Chloe1‚É£1‚É£, of the follow Crack!!! Soccer ‚öΩÔ∏èü§ôüèº". 

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main part is "Crack!!!" with multiple exclamation marks. "Crack" is a slang term for the drug crack cocaine. The user is thanking someone and mentioning "follow Crack", which might be a typo or a slang reference. The emojis are a soccer ball and a hand gesture, which might be related to the sport, but the key part here is "Crack".

So, the presence of "Crack" in all caps with exclamation marks likely indicates drug use. Even though it's in a context that might be a typo or a misused term, the term itself is a direct reference to the drug. The other parts of the post don't seem to relate to drug use beyond that. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled T.
