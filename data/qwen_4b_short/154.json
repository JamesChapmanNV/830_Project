Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about Demi Lovato talking about "Survivor's Guilt" after DMX's overdose.

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "overdose" and "Survivor's Guilt." DMX is a rapper known for his drug use, but the post is about the aftermath of his overdose. The main point is that Demi Lovato is discussing her feelings of guilt related to DMX's overdose. 

The rules state that T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention Demi Lovato using drugs, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. It's more about her emotional response to DMX's overdose. The term "Survivor's Guilt" is a metaphor for feeling guilty for surviving when someone else didn't. There's no direct mention of her own drug use or any slang related to drugs. 

So, the post is about a medical or policy-related discussion (DMX's overdose) and the emotional impact, which falls under F. The answer should be F.
