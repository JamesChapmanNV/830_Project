Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post mentions Prince's death and says he was publicly against drugs but died of an overdose. The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang), otherwise F.

First, I need to check if the post directly mentions drug use. The key part here is "died of an overdose." Overdose is a direct indication of drug use, specifically opioids, which are illicit drugs. The mention of Prince, a musician, who was known for his public stance against drugs, but the fact that he died from an overdose clearly points to drug use. 

So the post is stating that he used drugs (overdose) despite his public opposition. Therefore, according to the label rules, this should be labeled T because it's about drug use. The other parts about him being against drugs are context, but the overdose is the key indicator. There's no mention of slang or other drug-related activities beyond the overdose. So the answer is T.
