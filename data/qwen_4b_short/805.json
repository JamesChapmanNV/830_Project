Okay, let's tackle this label. The post is "CODEINE CUPS PAINT A PICTURE SO VIVID 🍼💟👽 #BeamUp". I need to determine if this is a T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases).

First, the main keyword here is "CODEINE". Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and classified as an illicit drug. The term "CUPS" might be a slang or a play on words. "PAINT A PICTURE" is metaphorical, but the presence of "CODEINE" is key. The emojis 🍼 (which is a grape, but sometimes used in drug slang?), 💟 (a heart symbol), and 👽 (a alien or otherworldly symbol) might add to the context. The hashtag #BeamUp is a bit unclear, but could be related to some subculture or meme.

But the main point is the mention of codeine. Even if the rest is metaphorical, the direct mention of a drug (codeine) would make it a T. However, I need to check if "codeine cups" is a slang term. Maybe "cups" refers to something else, like a container or a metaphor. But in the context of drug use, codeine is a drug. The phrase "paint a picture so vivid" could be a metaphor for the effects of codeine, but the presence of the drug name alone is enough to label it as T. So the answer should be T.
