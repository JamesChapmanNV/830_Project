Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "We Went Outside to Touch Grass, What Happens Next Might Shock You!!! (HEROIN???)"

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Touch Grass" and "HEROIN???". 

"Touch Grass" is a common slang for using marijuana, which is a drug. However, the mention of "HEROIN???" in parentheses is a bit confusing. HEROIN is a highly illegal and abusive drug. The use of "???" suggests some uncertainty or maybe a joke, but the presence of the word "HEROIN" itself is a clear indicator of drug use. 

But wait, the user's instruction says to check for any mention of drug use, including slang. The phrase "touch grass" is a slang for marijuana, which is a drug. However, the main question is whether the post is about drug use. The post seems to be a shocker, maybe implying that touching grass could lead to heroin use? Or maybe it's a metaphor? But the inclusion of "HEROIN" in parentheses is a direct reference to the drug. 

The rules state that T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. So even if it's a shocker, the mention of heroin is a direct indicator. The user might be trying to trick me into thinking it's a metaphor, but the presence of the word "HEROIN" is a clear T. 

Alternatively, maybe "touch grass" is a metaphor, but the parenthetical mention of heroin is a direct reference. So the label should be T because it mentions heroin, which is an illicit drug. Therefore, the answer is T.
