Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "I saw the thing about PlayStation having demos on the highest tier of psplus and I'm shaking my head, remember when demos used to be fucking free? X3"

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, the user is talking about PlayStation demos and PS+ tiers. They mention that demos used to be free but now they're on the highest tier. The phrase "fucking free" is used, but that's just an exclamation about the cost, not related to drugs. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any related terms. The "X3" at the end might be a typo or slang, but without more context, it's unclear. However, since there's no direct reference to drugs or drug-related activities, it doesn't fit the T category. 

The user is discussing a gaming topic, so it's more of a F case. The exclamation is about the price of demos, not about drugs. So the label should be F.
