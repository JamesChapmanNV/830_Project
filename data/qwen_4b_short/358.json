Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Yeah, I probably smoke too much....[[|:-D Please like and share! Meme archive: #meme #memes #memes2022 #MemistryonFB #PNWMemist #memesdaily #dankmemes #funnymemes #marijuana #weed #legalizeit".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "smoke too much" and the hashtags like #marijuana, #weed, #legalizeit. The user is talking about smoking, which could be marijuana. The hashtags are related to drugs and legalization. 

The rule says T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The phrase "smoke too much" is a slang term for using drugs, specifically marijuana. The hashtags also mention marijuana and weed, which are drugs. Even though the post is a meme and includes a request to like and share, the main content is about drug use. The mention of legalization might be part of the meme's context, but the core message is about smoking. 

So, the label should be T because it's discussing drug use (smoking) and includes related hashtags. The other parts like the meme request don't change the fact that the main content is about drug use. Therefore, the answer is T.
