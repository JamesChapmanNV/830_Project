Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post says: "That's cool Guuuurl ðŸ˜Ž. I just really into cannabis and shrooms. We got some cool breweries and a distillery in town."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the person mentions "cannabis" and "shrooms." Cannabis is a drug, and shrooms typically refer to mushrooms, which are often associated with psilocybin, a hallucinogenic drug. So those are both drugs. The user says they're "really into" them, which could imply use. Also, they mention breweries and a distillery. Wait, breweries usually make beer, which is alcohol, but distilleries might make spirits. However, the mention of cannabis and shrooms is the key here. 

The label rules say T if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, etc. Even if it's just talking about being into them, that's using slang. So "cannabis" and "shrooms" are both drugs. The presence of those terms would make it a T. The breweries and distillery might be a red herring, but the main focus is on the drugs. So the label should be T.
