Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The post is about someone hearing that adding a pinch of pure black tar heroin to every bottle is done, and some say they still do. The user is asking if it's worth digging into.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. The key terms here are "black tar heroin," which is a specific drug. The mention of adding it to every bottle suggests usage or distribution. The phrase "used to add" implies that someone is using or distributing the drug. Also, "still do" might indicate ongoing activity. 

The label rules say T if it's about drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. Here, the post is discussing the use of heroin, which is an illicit drug. Even though it's a rumor or hearsay, the content is about drug use. The user is asking if it's worth investigating, which could relate to seeking information about drug trafficking or use. 

So, the post is talking about drug use (heroin) in a context that might involve selling or distributing. Therefore, the label should be T. The other options are F if it's medical, policy, news, or discouraging use. But this is about drug use, so T is correct.
