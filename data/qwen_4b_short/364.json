Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a drug smuggler in 1985 who threw 76 pounds of cocaine into a forest, and a bear named Pablo EskoBear ate it all and died from an overdose.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "cocaine," "smuggler," "throwing," "eating," and "overdose." The story is about someone using drugs (cocaine) and the bear consuming it, leading to death. 

The rules say T if there's use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post mentions the drug smuggler, which is trafficking, and the bear eating cocaine, which is using. Even though the bear isn't a human, the act of using the drug is still present. The overdose is a direct result of drug use. 

But wait, the rules specify "text shows illicit or abusive drug use." The bear's actions are a result of the drug being consumed. The post is describing the use of cocaine by the bear, which is an example of drug use. So according to the rules, this would be T. However, the bear isn't a human, but the label is based on the text showing drug use, not the subject. So the answer should be T.
