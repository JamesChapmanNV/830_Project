Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking me to determine if the social media post falls under T (illicit drug use) or F (other cases). The post says, "I think Chauvin should be fired for not following procedure but be found not guilty for murder, because Mr Floyd died from a drug overdose."

First, I need to check if the text mentions drug use directly. The key part here is "died from a drug overdose." The term "drug overdose" is a direct reference to the use of illicit drugs. The person is stating that Floyd's death was due to a drug overdose, which is a medical or health-related issue. However, the label rules specify that T includes any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. 

But wait, the post is not about the user using drugs. It's about Floyd's death. The mention of a drug overdose is a cause of death, not the user's own drug use. However, the label rules might consider the context. If the post is discussing the cause of death related to drugs, does that count as T? The rules say T includes "slang for drugs," but here it's a medical condition. The user is not using drugs, but the post is discussing someone else's death due to drugs. 

Looking back at the rules: T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). The post doesn't mention the user using drugs. It's about Floyd's death. So even though "drug overdose" is mentioned, the context is about the cause of death, not the user's own drug use. Therefore, it's not T. The label would be F because it's a discussion about a cause of death, not the user's own drug use. 

But wait, maybe the term "drug overdose" is considered slang? No, "overdose" is a medical term. The rules mention slang for drugs. So unless the post uses slang terms, it's not T. The post is discussing the cause of death, which is a medical fact. So the label should be F.
