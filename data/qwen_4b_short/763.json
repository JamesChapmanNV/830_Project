Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Have an excellent and happy 420! How has cannabis affected your life?" 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post starts with "Have an excellent and happy 420!" 420 is a well-known slang for cannabis, specifically marijuana. So that's a clear reference to drugs. Then the question is about how cannabis has affected someone's life. The question itself is about the effects of cannabis, which is a drug. 

Now, the key here is whether the post is showing drug use. The user is asking about the effects of cannabis, which is a drug. However, the question is phrased in a way that's not necessarily about current use but rather the impact of using it. But the presence of the slang "420" and the mention of cannabis itself would trigger the T label because it's directly referencing drug use. 

But wait, the rules mention "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So even if the post is asking about the effects, the mention of cannabis (a drug) and the slang 420 would fall under T. The question is about the effects, but the content is still related to drug use. 

Alternatively, if the post was discussing medical uses or policy, that would be F. But here, it's about the personal impact of cannabis use. However, the label rules don't specify whether it's about current use or past use. The presence of the slang and the drug name is enough to label it as T. 

So the answer should be T because the post references cannabis (a drug) and uses 420, which is slang for it. Even though the question is about effects, the content is related to drug use. Therefore, the label is T.
