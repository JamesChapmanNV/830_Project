Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "But yeah codeine = dizzy too so.... not much help really, sorry". The options are T or F. 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post mentions "codeine". Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug in many contexts. The user is talking about the effect of codeine causing dizziness and saying it's not much help. The key here is whether this is a direct mention of drug use. 

The phrase "codeine = dizzy" is a direct reference to the drug's effect. The user is discussing their experience with codeine, which is a drug. Even though they're talking about the side effect, the mention of codeine itself is a drug. So according to the rules, this would fall under T because it's referring to the use of a drug (codeine) and its effects. 

But wait, is there a possibility that this is a metaphor? The user might be using codeine as a metaphor for something else. However, codeine is a known drug, and in this context, the user is talking about its effects. The phrase "not much help" could be a discussion about the drug's effectiveness, which is related to its use. 

So, the answer should be T because the text directly mentions the drug codeine and its use, even if it's discussing side effects. The key is that the post is about drug use, which falls under the T category.
