Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "GODDAMNIT SHE GIVIN HA MORPHINE IT'S OVER FORREAL DIS TIME".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let's break down the post.

The key words here are "HA MORPHINE". Wait, "HA" might be a typo or slang. But "morphine" is a drug. However, in the context, the user is saying "she giving HA morphine". Wait, maybe "HA" is a typo for "H.A."? Or maybe it's a slang term. Alternatively, could "HA" be a misspelling of "her"? But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe "HA" is a slang term for a drug. Wait, but "HA" is a common slang for "hah", but in this context, maybe "HA" is a typo for "her"? But that would be "she giving her morphine", which is possible. But the user is saying "she giving HA morphine". Alternatively, maybe "HA" is a slang term for a drug. Wait, but the main term here is "morphine", which is a controlled substance, an opioid. So if someone is being given morphine, that's a medical use, but in the context of the post, it's part of a statement that says "it's over for real dis time". 

But the user is using "GODDAMNIT" which is a strong exclamation, indicating frustration. The phrase "she giving HA morphine" could be referring to someone giving morphine to another person. However, the problem is whether "HA" here is a slang term for a drug. Alternatively, maybe "HA" is a typo for "her", but that's not clear. Alternatively, "HA" could be a slang term for a drug. Wait, in some contexts, "HA" is used as a slang for "her", but that's not related to drugs. Alternatively, maybe "HA" is a typo for "H.A." as in "her", but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "HA" as a slang term for a drug. For example, "HA" can sometimes be used as a slang for "her" or "has", but in this case, the presence of "morphine" is a key term. Morphine is a drug, so if the post is talking about someone giving morphine, that's a drug use. However, the context is "she giving HA morphine", which could be a typo or slang. But if the main term is morphine, then that's a drug. However, the user is using "HA" which might be a typo for "her" or "has", but that's not clear. Alternatively, "HA" could be a slang term for a drug. Wait, in some contexts, "HA" is used as a slang for "her", but that's not related to drugs. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "HA" as a slang term for a drug. For example, "HA" is sometimes used in some slang contexts, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe "HA" is a typo for "H.A." which is a term, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "HA" as a slang term for "her", but that's not related to drugs. However, the presence of "morphine" is a drug. So even if "HA" is a typo, the main term is morphine, which is a drug. But the user is saying "she giving HA morphine". If "HA" is a typo for "her", then it's "she giving her morphine", which is a medical use. But the user is using "GODDAMNIT" which suggests frustration, and "it's over for real dis time" which could be a statement that the person is done with something. However, the key is whether the post shows drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe "HA" is a slang term for a drug. For example, "HA" could be a slang for "heroin" in some contexts, but that's not standard. Alternatively, "HA" is a slang term for "hash", which is a type of drug. But that's not certain. However, the presence of "morphine" is a drug. So if the post is talking about someone giving morphine, that's a drug use. However, the user is saying "she giving HA morphine", which could be a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "HA" as a slang term for "her", and "morphine" is the drug. 

But according to the rules, if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, then it's T. So if "morphine" is present, and it's being given, that's a drug use. However, the question is whether the post is showing drug use. The user is saying that someone is giving morphine, which is a drug. But the context is that the user is expressing frustration, saying "it's over for real dis time". But the key is whether the post is showing drug use. So if the post is about giving morphine, that's a drug use. Therefore, the label would be T. 

But wait, maybe "HA" is a typo for "H.A." as in "her", but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe "HA" is a slang term for a drug. However, without more context, the presence of "morphine" is a drug. Therefore, the post is showing drug use. So the label is T.
