Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "proud of jesse pinkman for getting over his heroin addiction". 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to see if the post is about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The post mentions "heroin addiction". Heroin is an illicit drug, so that's a clear indicator. The person is talking about someone (Jesse Pinkman) overcoming heroin addiction. The word "addiction" here refers to the use of heroin, which is a drug. 

The label rules say T is for any text that shows drug use. Even though the post is about overcoming addiction, the fact that it's talking about heroin, which is an illegal drug, means it's still T. The other cases (F) are for medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. 

So, even though the post is positive and about recovery, the mention of heroin addiction directly relates to drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
