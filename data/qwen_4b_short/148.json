Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "New article: Georgia Governor Appoints New Cannabis Commission Chair -".

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, it's about a news article where a governor appoints a new chair for a Cannabis Commission. The key words here are "Cannabis Commission" and the action of appointing a chair. The term "cannabis" is the subject here. Now, I need to determine if this is related to drug use or not.

Cannabis is a drug, but in this context, it's part of a government commission, which is likely related to policy, regulation, or legal aspects. The post doesn't mention any illicit activity, using drugs, selling, trafficking, or slang. It's a news headline about a governmental appointment. The article itself is about the appointment, not about drug use. 

So according to the rules, since the post is about a policy-related news item and not discussing drug use, the label should be F. The term "cannabis" is present, but it's in the context of a commission, which is a regulatory body, not an illicit activity. Therefore, it's not T but F.
