Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "What a stupid tweet, the Pels were 3-0 against the Lakers this year and your sorry squad didn't crack the playoffs..."

First, I need to check if this post mentions anything related to drug use. The label rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user is talking about sports teams, the Pels (probably the Philadelphia 76ers) and the Lakers. They're commenting on the team's performance, mentioning a 3-0 record against the Lakers and not making the playoffs. There's no mention of drugs, drug slang, or any related terms. The language here is about sports, criticism of a team's performance, and maybe some slang like "sorry squad," but that's just a metaphor for a poor team, not related to drugs. 

So, since there's no drug-related content, the label should be F. The user is discussing sports, not drug use. Even though there's some strong language, it's not related to the prohibited topics. Therefore, the correct label is F.
