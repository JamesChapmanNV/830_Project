Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking to determine if the social media post falls under T (drug use) or F (other cases). The post says: "Went to 3 of my regular kedai arak to buy...no stock. On a very long waiting list."

First, I need to understand the key terms here. "Kedai arak" translates to "arak shop" in Malay. Arak is a type of traditional alcoholic drink, commonly consumed in Malaysia and Indonesia. It's a strong alcohol, but it's not classified as an illicit drug. The user went to three shops to buy arak but found no stock and was on a long waiting list.

Now, the label rules: T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

So, the user is talking about buying arak, which is an alcoholic drink. Even though it's strong, it's not a controlled substance or an illicit drug. The post is about trying to purchase a drink that's available in shops, but there's no stock. The mention of "waiting list" might imply that arak is in demand, but that's still a regular commodity, not a drug.

There's no mention of any drug-related activities like selling, trafficking, or using drugs. The term "arak" is a slang term for the drink, but it's not a drug. Therefore, this post doesn't fit the T category. It's more about a regular purchase of an alcoholic beverage, which would fall under F.
