Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is a quote from Jigga (probably Jay-Z) about fame being the worst drug, comparing it to heroin. The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use as per the label rules.

First, I need to check if the post mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The quote talks about fame being a drug, but it's a metaphor. The user's instruction says that F is for all other cases, including metaphors. The actual drugs mentioned here are heroin, which is an illicit drug, but the main point is the metaphorical comparison. The post doesn't explicitly talk about using drugs, but rather using fame as a metaphor for a drug-like addiction. 

So according to the rules, since it's a metaphor and not directly discussing drug use, the label should be F. The mention of heroin is a real drug, but the context is about fame being compared to a drug, not actual drug use. Therefore, the correct label is F.
