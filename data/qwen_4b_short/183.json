Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Posted a new song: "Codeine N Chill (Prod. by BirdieBands)"".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rule says T if it mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The song title is "Codeine N Chill". Codeine is a controlled substance, classified as a Schedule II drug in the US, which is a controlled substance. It's used medically but also has potential for abuse. The term "N Chill" might be slang, but I'm not sure. However, the presence of "Codeine" in the title directly references a drug. 

So, even if "N Chill" is a play on words, the mention of Codeine alone would trigger the T label. The post is about a song, but the title includes a drug name. The rules don't specify that it has to be explicit use, just that the text shows drug use. Since Codeine is a drug, the title would fall under T. 

Therefore, the correct label is T.
