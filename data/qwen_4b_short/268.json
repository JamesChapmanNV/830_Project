Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about someone changing their mind about swapping comic book issues, mentioning "the second part of the Speedy on heroin arc." 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key part here is "heroin arc." Heroin is an illicit drug, so that's a direct reference. The mention of "Speedy on heroin" suggests that the character is using heroin, which is a drug. 

The rules state that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use. Even if it's part of a fictional context like a comic book, the actual mention of heroin (a controlled substance) would still fall under T. The user is supposed to label it based on the presence of drug-related terms, regardless of context. 

The rest of the post talks about swapping comic issues and not being able to decide, which is unrelated. The main point is the mention of heroin in the comic arc. Therefore, the label should be T.
