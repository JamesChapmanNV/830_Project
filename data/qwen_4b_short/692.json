Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post mentions "Ativan" and "morphine," which are medications. Ativan is typically used for anxiety, and morphine is an opioid for pain. The context here is someone talking about their experience with a patient who was given these drugs every hour and every three hours, respectively, around the clock. The user is discussing the medical treatment, mentioning the necessity and emotional aspects.

Now, according to the label rules, T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

In this post, the drugs mentioned are medical treatments, not illicit drugs. The person is talking about a medical scenario where these medications are administered for a patient's comfort and pain management. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or slang related to drugs. The focus is on the medical necessity and the emotional impact of the treatment. Therefore, this should be labeled as F because it's a medical discussion, not related to drug abuse or illicit use.
