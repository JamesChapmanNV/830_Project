Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post says: "Right... But the prices need to chill out bc I just got happy that my tank filled under $30 IT NEEDS TO GO BACK DOWN TO $20". 

First, I need to check if this post mentions anything related to drug use. The labels T are for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user is talking about prices, specifically for a tank (which I think refers to a gas tank, since "tank filled" is a common phrase for gas). The mention of prices going down from $30 to $20 is about fuel prices. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any related terms. The phrase "chill out" could be a metaphor, but in this context, it's about prices, not drugs. 

The user is expressing frustration about the price of gas, not about drug-related activities. There's no slang or any indication of drug use here. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's about a non-drug topic. The key is to ensure that there's no mention of drugs or drug-related terms. Since there's none, the answer is F.
