Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Fucke codeine and fuck do you even get cancer, I've had cartons of smokes in my face and I drop this album universe???"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The words "codeine" is a controlled substance, so that's a direct mention. Then "smokes" could refer to cigarettes, but in the context of drug use, it might be slang for something else. However, the key here is "cartons of smokes in my face" which could imply heavy smoking, possibly recreational or medicinal. But codeine is a narcotic, so that's definitely a T. The rest of the post is about dropping an album, which is unrelated. The mention of cancer might be a metaphor, but the presence of codeine and smoking (assuming it's drug-related) would make it T. The user is using strong language, but the main points are drug references. So the label should be T.
