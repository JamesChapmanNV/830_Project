Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone experiencing kidney stone pain, comparing it to childbirth, and going to the ER for morphine. 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use. The person mentions morphine, which is a medication used for pain relief. But the label rules specify that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Morphine is a prescription opioid, not an illicit drug. The person is getting it from the emergency room, which is a medical setting. The post is about managing pain, not using drugs for recreational or abusive purposes. The mention of morphine is in the context of medical treatment, not drug abuse. 

The other parts of the post talk about kidney stones and pain comparison, which are medical issues. The laughter emoji might indicate the person is being humorous, but that doesn't relate to drug use. 

So, since there's no indication of illicit drug use, just medical treatment, the label should be F.
