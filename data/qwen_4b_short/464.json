Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post about George Floyd. The post says, "Cardiologist: George Floyd did not die from a drug overdose or heart attack news." The options are T or F. 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post here is a statement from a cardiologist stating that George Floyd didn't die from a drug overdose or heart attack. The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. The mention of "drug overdose" is part of the medical context. However, the post is not stating that George Floyd used drugs, but rather that the cause of death wasn't a drug overdose. 

But wait, the label T is for text that shows drug use. The post is not stating that George Floyd used drugs, but rather that the cause of death was not a drug overdose. So the post is about the medical cause of death, not about drug use. Therefore, it's more of a news or medical discussion. 

But I should check if "drug overdose" is considered part of the T category. The rule says T includes "slang for drugs." However, in this case, the post is not using slang but is stating that the cause wasn't a drug overdose. So the post is not showing drug use, but rather discussing the cause of death. Therefore, the label should be F.
