Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "EXCLUSIVE: Enveric Offers Investors Rare Exposure To Both Cannabis And Psychedelic Industries".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The keywords here are "Cannabis" and "Psychedelic Industries". 

Cannabis is a drug, but the post is talking about investing in industries related to cannabis and psychedelics. The term "psychedelic" might refer to drugs like LSD or mushrooms, which are illicit. However, the post is about industries, not direct use or mention of drug use. It's more about investment opportunities rather than personal use or trafficking.

The label rules say T if it's about drug use, and F otherwise. Since the post is discussing investment in industries related to drugs, but not explicitly about using, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. It's more of a business or market discussion. So, the label should be F. But wait, I need to make sure. The term "psychedelic industries" could be a red flag. However, the context is about investment, not personal use. The answer is F.
