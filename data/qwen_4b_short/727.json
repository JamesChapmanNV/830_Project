Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the post "Surely heroin is a'soft' drug?" as either T or F based on the given rules. The rules state that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to analyze the post. The sentence is a question about heroin being a "soft" drug. The term "soft" here is likely a slang term. In drug slang, "soft" can refer to drugs that are considered less dangerous or easier to use, but in reality, heroin is a highly addictive and illicit drug. However, the key here is whether the post is discussing drug use itself or using it as a metaphor.

The phrase "soft drug" is a common slang term in the context of drug use. The user is using the term "soft" to describe heroin, which is a slang term for a drug. The question is about the classification of heroin as a "soft" drug, which is a slang term. However, the post itself isn't explicitly stating that someone is using heroin or discussing the act of using it. It's more of a statement about the classification of heroin, possibly in a medical or policy context. But wait, "soft drug" is a slang term, so maybe it's considered as using slang for drugs. 

But the rules specify that T includes slang for drugs. So if the post uses slang for drugs, it's T. However, the post is a question about the classification of heroin, not necessarily stating that someone is using it. The term "soft" here is a slang term for drugs. So the post is using slang to refer to heroin, which is a drug. Therefore, the label would be T because it's using slang for drugs. Alternatively, if the post is just discussing the classification without any direct reference to use, maybe it's F. But the term "soft drug" is a slang term, so even if it's a question about classification, the use of the term "soft drug" is slang for drugs. Therefore, the label should be T.
