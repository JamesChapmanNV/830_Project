Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is "ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ you smoking heroin??". The rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any of those terms. The word "heroin" is definitely an illicit drug. The phrase "you smoking heroin" directly refers to using heroin. The user is asking if someone is smoking heroin, which is a clear indication of drug use. The emojis are just expressions, but the main content is the question about heroin use. 

So according to the rules, since it's directly mentioning the use of heroin, which is an illicit drug, this should be labeled T. There's no mention of medical use, policy, news, or discouraging use here. The question is about someone using heroin, which falls under T. Therefore, the answer should be T.
