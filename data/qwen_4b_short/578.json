Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "ON HEROIN ALLERGY DEATHS, THEY DO NOT MEAN TO KILL YOU, THEY DO NOT SEE YOU. JF"

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. The key words here are "HEROIN ALLERGY DEATHS". Heroin is an illicit drug, so that's a direct mention of a drug. The phrase "they do not mean to kill you" might be a metaphor, but the mention of heroin deaths is a clear reference to drug use. The "JF" at the end is likely a signature or a code, but the main content is about heroin and deaths related to allergies.

According to the label rules, T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post directly mentions heroin, which is an illicit drug. Even though the context is about allergy deaths, the mention of heroin itself is enough to trigger the T label. The part about "they do not mean to kill you" might be a metaphor, but the presence of the drug name is a clear indicator. Therefore, the correct label should be T.
