Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about comparing intravenous drug use to socially acceptable activities like coffee and beer. The person is criticizing the normalization of heroin use in a school setting.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use directly. The key terms here are "intravenous drug use" and "heroin use by a kids school." The user is talking about using drugs, specifically heroin, and the context is about normalizing it. The post also uses words like "using," "seeking," and "selling" in the context of drug use. 

According to the label rules, T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post clearly refers to heroin use, which is an illicit drug. The mention of intravenous drug use is also a direct reference to drug use. Even though the post is critical of normalizing this behavior, the content itself is about drug use. 

The other category, F, includes medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. But here, the post is not a metaphor. It's directly discussing drug use and its normalization. So the correct label should be T.
