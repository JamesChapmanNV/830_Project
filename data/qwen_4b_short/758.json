Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post says, "The doctor prescribed me codeine pills & I never even used them." 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person mentions being prescribed codeine pills. Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medical contexts. The key here is whether the post indicates actual use. The user says they "never even used them," so they haven't used the pills. 

The label rules focus on showing drug use. Since the person hasn't used the pills, there's no indication of using, seeking, buying, etc. The post is more about the prescription and not using it. So this would fall under F because it's a medical discussion about a prescription but not actual drug use. 

Wait, but codeine is a drug. However, the post doesn't mention using it. The label is about showing drug use. Since they didn't use them, it's not T. Therefore, the correct label should be F.
