Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post talks about the opioid crisis, mentioning morphine and oxys (which is oxycontin, a drug). The user is describing a situation where someone's stepdad had these drugs in the bathroom, leading to a lot of deaths and people being "fried for life." The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to check if the post includes any direct references to using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The mention of "morphine" and "oxys" (oxycontin) are definitely drugs. The context is about the opioid crisis, which is related to drug abuse. The post also mentions "so many dead kids" and "people fried for life," which are consequences of drug use. 

The rules say T if it's about drug use, and F otherwise. The post is discussing the use of morphine and oxys, which are drugs, and the impact of their use. Even though it's a reflection on the past, the content directly references drug use. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled T. The other cases would be if it's about medical discussions, policy, news, or discouraging use, but this is clearly about the use and consequences of drugs. So the answer is T.
