Okay, let's tackle this labeling problem. The user wants me to determine if the given social media post falls under category T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). 

First, I need to understand the content of the post. The post says, "fun fact wine actually can cause an overdose! and no od'ing in any capacity does not cause asphyxiation, why so keen to defend a murderer?"

Breaking it down, the first part mentions wine causing an overdose. Wine is an alcoholic beverage, and while alcohol can lead to poisoning or overdose in high quantities, it's not classified as an illicit drug. The term "overdose" here might be a bit of a stretch, but it's not about drug use per se.

Then there's the part about "no od'ing in any capacity does not cause asphyxiation." The word "od'ing" is likely a typo or a slang term. Maybe they meant "dying" or "dope"? If it's referring to drug use, like "dope," then that could be a T. But "od'ing" might be a misspelling of "dying" or another term. However, the second part says that not doing something (not "od'ing") doesn't cause asphyxiation, which seems like a metaphorical or logical statement. 

The last part, "why so keen to defend a murderer?" seems like a rhetorical question, possibly in response to someone defending a murderer, which is unrelated to drug use. 

So, the key points here are: wine (not a drug), possible misspelled slang (od'ing), and a question about defending a murderer. The main subject is not about drug use but rather a factual statement about alcohol and a rhetorical question. 

Since the post doesn't mention any illicit drugs, drug use, or slang related to drugs, even if "od'ing" is a typo, it's not clear enough to categorize as T. The main topic is about wine and asphyxiation, which are not related to drug abuse. Therefore, the label should be F.
