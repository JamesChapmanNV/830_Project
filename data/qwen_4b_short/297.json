Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I knew he was smoking crack just like the idiots being happy about this shit ðŸ˜‘ðŸ¤¡". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key part is "smoking crack". Crack is a slang term for a type of illicit drug. The person is stating that someone else is using crack. The phrase "smoking crack" directly refers to the use of an illegal drug. The rest of the sentence talks about others being happy about it, which might be a metaphor, but the main action here is the explicit mention of drug use. 

The other parts like "idiots being happy about this shit" could be a metaphor, but the presence of "smoking crack" is a clear indicator of T. Even if the rest is metaphorical, the direct mention of drug use qualifies it as T. 

So the label should be T.
