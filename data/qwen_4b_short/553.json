Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is in Spanish, so I need to parse that correctly.

First, the post says: "now kiles create a new project, And in 1 years win the final championship Valorant AGAIN Crack absoluto #yoestoyconkiles"

Breaking it down. The main parts are about Kiles creating a project, winning a Valorant championship, and then "Crack absoluto". The hashtag is #yoestoyconkiles, which translates to "I am with Kiles".

Now, the key part here is "Crack absoluto". I need to check if this is a slang term for drugs. "Crack" is a slang term for a type of cocaine. "Absoluto" might be a variation or a different term, but in Spanish, "crack" is definitely associated with cocaine. So "Crack absoluto" would be referring to using cocaine. 

The other parts of the post are about a gaming project and a championship, which are unrelated to drug use. The hashtag is just a support tag for Kiles, which is a gaming streamer. 

Since "Crack absoluto" is a direct reference to drug use (cocaine), this should be labeled T. The rest of the post doesn't mention drug use, so the main indicator here is that phrase. 

I need to make sure there's no other hidden meaning or metaphor. But given the context, it's a direct reference to drug use. So the label should be T.
