Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "life you can't reject. capitalism injects a morphine called 'hope' as collateral for dreams. â€º strange"

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text uses terms like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key part is "morphine called 'hope'". Morphine is a drug, but here it's used metaphorically. The phrase "injects a morphine" is a metaphor, comparing capitalism's hope to morphine, which is a painkiller. The user is using this metaphor to criticize capitalism, not actually referring to using morphine. 

The other parts of the post talk about capitalism and hope, but there's no direct mention of drug use. The word "morphine" is a slang term for drugs, but in this context, it's a metaphor. The user isn't talking about using drugs, but rather using a drug's effect as a metaphor. 

So, since the post is using a metaphor and not actually discussing drug use, the label should be F. The rules state that F includes metaphorical uses, so even though "morphine" is a drug term, the context here is metaphorical, not actual drug use. Therefore, the answer is F.
