Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about The Standard interviewing the head of SF's Office of Cannabis discussing 4/20 celebrations, equity in the cannabis industry, and the city's policies on legal weed.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key points here are about cannabis policies, legal weed, and discussions around equity and celebrations. The term "cannabis" is used, but it's in the context of legal, regulated use. The 4/20 celebration is a reference to cannabis, but it's a cultural event, not necessarily about drug use. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post is more about policy discussions and news related to legal cannabis. So according to the rules, since there's no indication of illicit drug use, the label should be F. The user emphasized returning only T or F, so I need to make sure I don't add any extra text.
