Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about opioid users being amateur medics because they self-medicate for mental health issues like PTSD, and now they're becoming amateur paranemics due to the fentanyl overdose crisis in Vancouver.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "opioid users," "street drug use," "self-medication," "fentanyl overdose crisis." The mention of drug use is direct. The post is discussing the use of drugs (opioids and fentanyl) and their role in self-medication for mental health issues. 

The rules state that T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post doesn't just mention the effects or consequences but directly talks about drug use. Even though it's discussing the context of mental health, the presence of drug use terms like "street drug use" and "fentanyl" clearly falls under T. 

The other cases (F) are for medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. This post is more about the reality of drug use and its impact, not just discussing it as a policy or medical issue. The mention of "paranemics" might be a typo for "paramedics," but even if it's a slang term, the context is about drug use. 

So, the answer should be T because the post directly references drug use and the associated issues.
