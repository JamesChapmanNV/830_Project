Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post mentions morphine from China, which is an illicit drug. Then there's a part about "shit to make your dick hard" and "shit'll find your dick," which sounds like slang for drug use. Also, it mentions a drug from Kenya intended for gorillas but causing masturbation in humans. All these references are about drug use, so according to the rules, that's a T. The other parts are just descriptions of the drug's effects, which still fall under T. So the answer should be T.
