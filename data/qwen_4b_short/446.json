Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

The post says: "Gotta LOOOVE maple ridge. Walk to the gas station with Jon and theres some guy smoking heroin right beside the window where we have to buy our stuff. Fuck this place. I'm out."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use. The key part here is "some guy smoking heroin." Heroin is an illicit drug, so that's a clear T. The person is directly stating that someone is using heroin. Even though the context is about a negative experience at the gas station, the act of smoking heroin is a direct indicator of drug use. The rest of the post talks about the location and the person's frustration, but the main point here is the mention of heroin use. So according to the rules, this should be labeled T.
