Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about someone recovering after surgery, using painkillers, specifically morphine. The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to check the label rules again. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post mentions "pain killers" and "morphine." Morphine is a controlled substance, but in this context, it's being used medically after surgery. The person is in pain and taking prescribed medication. There's no mention of illicit use, abuse, or slang. The focus is on recovery, hospital stay, and the nurses. The use of morphine here is part of standard medical treatment, not recreational or abusive use. 

So, even though morphine is a strong opioid, the context is medical. The person isn't seeking or using it illegally. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's a medical discussion about post-surgery pain management.
