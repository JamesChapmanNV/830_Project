Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "steal the night K WORD the lights feel it under your skin time is right uhhh Cuz its pulling you in pump it up you cant stop cuz it feels like an overdose FEELS LIKE AN OVERDOOOSE Bah BAh evacuate the dance floor bah bah im infected by the sound".

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let me go through the post line by line.

The first part: "steal the night K WORD the lights feel it under your skin time is right". "K WORD" could be a slang term. I'm not sure what "K WORD" refers to, but sometimes "K" can be slang for "kilo" which is related to drugs, but "K WORD" might be a song title or something else. However, the next part is "feels like an overdose" which is a direct reference to drug use. Then there's "FEELS LIKE AN OVERDOOSE" repeated, which is a clear mention of an overdose. Also, "pump it up you cant stop" could be metaphorical, but the mention of overdose is a strong indicator. The phrase "im infected by the sound" might be metaphorical, but the overdose part is a direct reference. 

The key here is whether "overdose" is used in the context of drug use. Since the post mentions "feels like an overdose" and "overdooose", which is a misspelling but still refers to an overdose, that's a clear T. Even if some parts are metaphorical, the explicit mention of overdose points to drug use. So the label should be T.
