Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about opium being collected from the poppy plant and mentions codeine and morphine, which are components of pharmaceutical opioids like naloxone. The end has a reminder to be smart, safe, and know what you're taking.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text uses, seeks, buys, sells, traffics, or uses slang for drugs. The post talks about opium, codeine, morphine, and naloxone. These are all related to drugs, but the context here is educationalâ€”explaining the source and composition of these substances. The mention of pharmaceutical opioids and naloxone (which is an opioid antagonist) might be part of a health or medical discussion. 

The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use in a way that's illicit or abusive. The text is informative, explaining the origin and components of opioids, not necessarily promoting or discussing their use. The phrase "Be smart Be safe. Know what you're taking" is a cautionary note, which is more about awareness rather than encouraging use. 

Since there's no explicit mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or slang for drugs in a way that indicates abuse, but rather a factual explanation and a safety reminder, it might fall under F. However, the presence of drug-related terms could be tricky. But according to the rules, F is for all other cases, including medical discussions. So even though it's about drugs, if it's not about using or abusing them, it's F. The post is more about the science and safety, not the abuse. So the label should be F.
