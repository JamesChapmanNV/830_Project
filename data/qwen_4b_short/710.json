Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The user is asking me to determine if the given social media post falls under T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). 

First, I need to read the post carefully. The user mentions "Broadway street is something fucking else." Then they talk about seeing a dead kitten on the freeway and comparing it to Broadway being worse. The key part here is where they say, "P sure I saw two dudes shooting each other's heroin ðŸ™ƒ". 

Breaking it down: "shooting each other's heroin" â€“ the term "shooting" here is slang for injecting drugs, which is a common slang term for using heroin. The mention of two dudes doing this clearly indicates drug use. The use of "heroin" is explicit. Also, the context of seeing people shooting heroin in a public place like Broadway suggests that the post is about drug use. 

I should check if there's any other part that might be a metaphor or not related. The dead kitten is a separate event, but the main point is the drug use described. The "P sure" might be a typo for "P sure" but the main action is the heroin use. 

Since the post directly mentions heroin use and the method of injection ("shooting"), this clearly falls under T. The other parts are just context but the key element is the drug use. So the label should be T.
