Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says: "Cannula's are my worst enemy. These are from the nurses spending almost 2 hours, while I was unconscious from morphine, trying to put a cannula in me!" 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about a cannula. Wait, cannula is a medical device, right? It's a tube used for inserting medication or for monitoring. But the user mentions that they were unconscious from morphine. Morphine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. However, the post is about the experience of having a cannula inserted by nurses. 

Now, the key here is whether the post is indicating drug use. The person is not talking about using drugs, but rather about a medical procedure. They were unconscious due to morphine, which is a drug, but that's part of their medical treatment. The cannula is a medical device, not a slang term for a drug. 

The user might be upset about the procedure taking a long time, but there's no mention of seeking, buying, selling, or using drugs. The mention of morphine is part of their medical condition, not necessarily indicating abuse. The post is more about a negative experience with medical treatment rather than drug use. 

So, according to the rules, since there's no indication of illicit drug use or slang, it should be labeled F. The mention of morphine is a medical drug, not a slang term for an illicit drug. The cannula is a medical device. Therefore, the label is F.
