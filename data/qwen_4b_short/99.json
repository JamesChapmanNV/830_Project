Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I am Mexican and I'm not a drug dealer üëç". The rules are that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to analyze the post. The person says they are Mexican and not a drug dealer. The key words here are "not a drug dealer". The post is stating their identity and denying being involved in drug dealing. There's no mention of using drugs, seeking them, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang terms related to drugs. The statement is about their identity and a denial of a role in drug dealing. 

So, the question is whether this falls under T or F. Since the post doesn't mention any drug use or related activities, just stating they are not a drug dealer, it seems like it's not showing illicit drug use. The label should be F. The person is not discussing drug use but rather their own identity and a denial of a specific role. There's no indication of drug use or related activities here. Therefore, the correct label is F.
