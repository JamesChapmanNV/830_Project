Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post says: "In recovery from my inguinal hernia surgery. I have to stay over night here in Loja so the staff could keep tabs on me in the event there are any complications. Morphine is good shit."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The main points here are about recovering from hernia surgery, staying overnight for monitoring, and mentioning morphine. 

Morphine is a medication used for pain relief, especially after surgery. The user says "Morphine is good shit," which is a colloquial expression. But the key here is whether this is considered drug use. Since morphine is a prescribed medication for pain management, not an illicit drug, the mention of it here is in the context of medical treatment. The user isn't using it for recreational purposes or in a way that indicates abuse. 

The label rules state that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. The post doesn't mention any slang for drugs or activities related to drug use. It's about medical recovery and a medication used in treatment. Therefore, this should be labeled F, as it's a medical context, not drug abuse or illicit use.
