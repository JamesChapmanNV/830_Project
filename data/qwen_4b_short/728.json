Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Mac & Cheese doesn`t contain many vitamins, so it`s important you always eat a bunch of it..... Ask GenieNansea DogWalker Podcast Cannabis 101 Budtender Trainer #applepodcasts #spotifypodcast #cannabis #cannabiseducation #cannabisindustry".

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The main content here is about Mac & Cheese lacking vitamins and the importance of eating it. Then there's a mention of a podcast related to cannabis education, training, and industry. The hashtags include #cannabis, #cannabiseducation, etc. 

The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. The first part is about nutrition, which is F. The second part is about a podcast that educates on cannabis. The term "Cannabis 101" and the hashtags suggest it's about cannabis education, which is part of the F category because it's a discussion on cannabis, not necessarily drug use. The rules say F includes medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor. Since the post is about a podcast that educates on cannabis, it's not about using or seeking drugs. There's no mention of buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The only possible mention is the podcast, but that's part of the cannabis industry, which is F. So the label should be F.
