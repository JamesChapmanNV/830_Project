Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a heroin haul and an importer being arrested. The rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any of those keywords. The post says "205kg heroin haul in Gujarat: Importer from Amritsar arrested." The key terms here are "heroin haul" and "importer arrested." Heroin is an illicit drug, and importing it would be trafficking or selling. The term "haul" here refers to the amount of drugs seized, which is related to trafficking. The importer is involved in bringing the drugs into the country, which is a form of drug trafficking. 

The source is mentioned as Hindustan Times via Dailyhunt, but that's just the news source. The main content is about the arrest of someone involved in importing heroin. Since the post is reporting on the trafficking of heroin, it falls under the T category. There's no mention of medical use, policy discussion, or discouraging use. The focus is on the illegal activity of importing a large quantity of heroin. Therefore, the label should be T.
