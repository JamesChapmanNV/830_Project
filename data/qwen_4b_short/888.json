Okay, let's tackle this. The post is: "He's clearly incapable. Perhaps it's the morphine from his pre-surgical bed?" The task is to label this as T or F based on the rules provided.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user mentions "morphine." Morphine is a controlled substance, typically used in medical settings for pain management. The sentence is talking about someone being incapable, possibly due to morphine from before surgery. The key here is whether this is indicating drug use or a medical context. 

The phrase "pre-surgical bed" suggests that the morphine was administered before a surgical procedure, which is a standard medical practice. The mention of morphine here is in a medical context, not as slang or indicating abuse. The person is talking about the effects of morphine, which is a drug used medically. There's no indication of illicit use, seeking, selling, or trafficking. The statement is more about the medical reason for the person's incapacity, not about drug abuse. 

So, according to the rules, since it's a medical discussion about a drug used in a legitimate medical context, the label should be F. There's no slang or indication of abuse here. The user is not discussing drug use in a way that would fall under T. Therefore, the correct label is F.
