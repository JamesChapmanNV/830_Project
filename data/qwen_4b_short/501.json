Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F. The post is: "Uhhh lemme get a Caesar salad please with croutons and codeine dressing." 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise.

Looking at the post, the person is ordering a Caesar salad with codeine dressing. Codeine is a drug, right? But wait, is codeine dressing a slang term here? Or is it a literal request? Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. However, in some contexts, codeine is used in medications, like in some cough syrups. But in this case, the person is asking for a salad dressing made with codeine. That seems unusual. But is that considered drug use?

Wait, the label rules include slang for drugs. So if "codeine dressing" is a slang term for something else, maybe. But codeine itself is a drug. However, in the context of a salad dressing, it's more likely that the person is referring to a dressing that contains codeine, which is a controlled substance. But is that considered using or seeking drugs? Or is it just a literal request for a dressing that contains codeine, which is a drug but not necessarily being used in a way that's illicit?

Hmm. The key here is whether the post shows drug use. If someone is ordering a salad with codeine dressing, is that using the drug? Or is it just a metaphor or a mistake? Codeine is a drug, but in this case, it's part of a salad dressing. But if the dressing is made with codeine, that would be a very unusual and possibly illegal thing to do. However, the person is just ordering it, not necessarily using it. But the question is whether the text shows drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe "codeine dressing" is a slang term for something else. But I don't think that's the case. Codeine is a drug, so if someone is ordering a dressing with codeine, that's a direct mention of the drug. So according to the rules, that would be T because it's a slang for drugs (codeine is a drug). But wait, the label rules specify that T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the person is using codeine in a dressing, is that considered using the drug? Or is it just a literal request for a dressing that contains codeine, which is a drug but not necessarily being used in a way that's illicit?

Alternatively, maybe the person is using codeine as a slang term. But codeine is a drug, so if they're ordering a dressing with codeine, that's a direct mention of the drug. Therefore, the label should be T. But I need to check if that's considered using or seeking. Since the person is ordering a salad with codeine dressing, it's possible that they are seeking or using the drug. But maybe it's just a mistake or a metaphor. However, according to the rules, any mention of the drug's name would be T. So the answer is T.
