Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Now do all the years Johnny Depp was using heroin and opioids? You know...for continuity." 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if the text mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the user is asking about Johnny Depp's use of heroin and opioids. The words "using heroin and opioids" directly mention drug use. Heroin and opioids are illicit drugs. The question is about his past use, so it's talking about drug use. 

But wait, the user is asking about it in the context of continuity, maybe for a movie or something. But the key part here is the mention of "using heroin and opioids." That's a direct reference to drug use. So according to the rules, that would be T. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that might make it F. The post isn't discussing medical use, policy, news, or discouraging use. It's just pointing out that he used those drugs. So the label should be T.
