Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "yall know something wrong in the universe when im listening to Codeine Crazy on repeat". 

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Codeine Crazy". Codeine is a controlled substance, a type of opioid, which is classified as an illicit drug. The phrase "Crazy" might be a slang term or a reference to the song's title. But the main point is that Codeine is a drug. 

The user is talking about listening to the song "Codeine Crazy" repeatedly. Now, the question is whether this is a direct reference to drug use. The song title might be a metaphor or a reference to the drug itself. However, the presence of the drug name in the title could be a clue. 

The rules state that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, the post doesn't explicitly mention using the drug, but the song title includes the drug name. However, the user is not necessarily using the drug; they're talking about listening to a song. But the song's title might be a metaphor or a reference to the drug. 

Wait, but the song "Codeine Crazy" is a real song by The White Stripes, which is a metaphorical reference to the drug codeine. So the user is referencing a song that's named after a drug. But does that count as showing drug use? The rules are about text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post itself doesn't mention using the drug, but the song title includes the drug name. 

However, the label is based on the text. If the text includes the drug name in a song title, is that considered as showing drug use? The rules don't specify that it has to be explicit use, but rather if the text shows the use. The song title is a reference, but the user is not using the drug. They are just talking about the song. 

But maybe the song's title is a slang term. However, in this case, the song is a metaphor for the drug. The user is not using the drug, but the song's title is related. However, the label rules include "slang for drugs". If "Codeine Crazy" is considered slang for drugs, then maybe it's T. But the song's title is more of a metaphor. 

Alternatively, the user might be implying that the song is about codeine, which is a drug. But the post itself doesn't mention using codeine. It's just about listening to the song. 

The rules are about text that shows drug use. The post doesn't show using, seeking, buying, etc. It's just a reference to a song. Therefore, the label would be F. But I'm not sure. The song title includes the drug name, but the user isn't using it. So maybe it's F. However, if the song is considered as a slang term for the drug, then maybe T. 

But the rules don't mention song titles. The key is whether the text shows drug use. The text here is about listening to a song named after a drug. The user is not using the drug, but the song's title is a reference. So the answer might be F because there's no direct mention of using, seeking, buying, etc. The song title is a reference, but not showing the use. Therefore, F.
