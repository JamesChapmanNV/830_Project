Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone overdosing, specifically mentioning George overdosing. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. 

First, the post says "George overdosed." Overdose is directly related to drug use, so that's a clear indicator. The phrase "overdose" is a direct mention of drug use, which falls under T. 

But wait, the user also mentioned that the post includes some details about the jury not believing it. However, the main action here is the overdose itself. The rest of the sentence talks about the aftermath, like being face down on the ground, handcuffed, and a knee on his neck. Those are more about the consequences of the overdose rather than the act of using drugs. 

The rules specify that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Overdose is a result of drug use, so even though the post is about the outcome, the act of overdosing is a direct indicator of drug use. Therefore, the label should be T. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphor here. The post is stating a factual eventâ€”George overdosed. There's no metaphorical language. So the correct label is T.
