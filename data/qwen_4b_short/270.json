Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Him and Davison getting arrested over this Kinahan shit would be tremendous. They'd both grass in a heartbeat. Davison would be first to crack."

First, I need to understand what the rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "grass" and "Kinahan shit." I know that "grass" is slang for marijuana. So that's a drug reference. The mention of "Kinahan" might be a reference to a person or a group involved in drug trafficking, but the main point is the slang term "grass." 

The sentence says they would "grass in a heartbeat," which means they would inform on each other, likely in the context of drug activities. The phrase "Kinahan shit" could be referring to illegal activities, possibly drug-related. The mention of being arrested over this suggests that the context is about drug crimes.

So, the post is discussing people getting arrested for drug-related activities, using slang terms for drugs. The phrase "grass" is a direct reference to drug use. Therefore, this should be labeled T because it involves drug use and trafficking. The other parts of the sentence are about the consequences of their actions, which are related to drug abuse. 

I don't see any other terms that are not related to drugs. The rest of the sentence is about the outcome of their actions, which is part of the drug-related context. So the label should be T.
