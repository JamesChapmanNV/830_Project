Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Booze? Lol.. Me I nor be alcohol person o. I don't take neither do I buy it for anyone. Kush, Codeine.. I'm Game." 

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the first part: "Booze? Lol.. Me I nor be alcohol person o." Here, "booze" is a slang term for alcohol. But the user says they aren't an alcohol person. Then they mention "Kush" which is slang for cannabis. "Codeine" is a controlled substance, often used in medications, but it's also a drug. The last part says "I'm Game," which might be a slang term for being ready or willing, but in some contexts, it could be related to drug use. However, "Kush" and "Codeine" are the key terms here.

So "Kush" is a drug (marijuana), and "Codeine" is a controlled substance. The user mentions using them, so that's T. The other parts about not taking or buying alcohol might be irrelevant since the main focus is on the drugs mentioned. The label should be T because it directly references drug use.
