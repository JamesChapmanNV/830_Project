Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about marijuana being linked to heart disease and a supplement possibly mitigating the risk, from Stanford Medicine.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "marijuana" and "supplement." Marijuana is a drug, but the context here is about research and a supplement that might reduce risk. The post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. It's discussing a medical study, so it's a news article. The label rules say T is for drug use related activities, and F is for medical/policy discussion, news, etc. Since the post is about a study and not about using or dealing drugs, it should be F. The mention of marijuana is in a medical context, not as a drug use. So the answer is F.
