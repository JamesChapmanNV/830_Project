Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says, "Dropped 2 ounces of codeine in my Minute Maid üçá". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to parse the sentence. The key words here are "dropped 2 ounces of codeine". Codeine is a controlled substance, classified as a narcotic. The action here is "dropped", which might be a bit ambiguous. But in the context of drug use, "dropping" could refer to using or possessing the drug. The mention of "Minute Maid" is probably a brand name of a soda, so that's just a reference to the container, not related to drugs. 

Now, codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. The quantity is 2 ounces, which is a significant amount. The act of dropping it might be part of using or possessing. The user is likely referring to using codeine, which is an illicit drug in many contexts. 

But wait, codeine is also used in some over-the-counter medications. However, the post doesn't mention any medical context. The presence of the drug in a soda container might be a way to indicate possession or use. The label is T if it's showing drug use. So, "dropped" here is likely part of using or having the drug. 

Therefore, the correct label should be T because it's indicating the use or possession of an illicit drug (codeine), which is a controlled substance.
