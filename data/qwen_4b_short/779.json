Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Because, as far as I know, I'm not addicted to morphine! Caffeine, on the other hand, is life. Much like futbol."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the user mentions "morphine" and "caffeine." Morphine is a controlled substance, an opioid, so that's a drug. But the user says they're not addicted to morphine. However, the key here is whether the post is indicating current use or discussion about use. 

The phrase "I'm not addicted to morphine" might imply past use or a history of use, but not necessarily current use. However, the presence of the drug name itself might still trigger the T label. But wait, the rules are about showing illicit or abusive drug use. If the person is talking about not being addicted, maybe it's a discussion about their addiction status, not current use. 

Then there's "caffeine," which is a legal stimulant. The user compares caffeine to "life" and mentions "futbol," which is Spanish for football. The mention of "futbol" is probably a slang or metaphor, not a drug. 

So, the main drug mentioned is morphine. The user is talking about not being addicted, but the presence of the drug name might still be considered as showing drug use. However, the label is for showing use, not necessarily current use. The rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." 

Is "morphine" considered slang here? No, it's a direct mention of a drug. But the user is not currently using it, just discussing addiction. However, the act of mentioning the drug itself might still fall under T. Alternatively, if the post is about discussing addiction, maybe it's F. 

Wait, the rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. If the user is talking about not being addicted, but the drug is mentioned, does that count as showing use? Or is it just discussing it? 

In the example, the user is not currently using morphine, but the mention of the drug could still be considered as showing drug use. But the rules might be more about explicit references to using, seeking, etc. If the user is not using it, maybe it's F. But the presence of the drug name might be considered as showing drug use. 

Alternatively, if the post is about discussing addiction, maybe it's F. The label F is for medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor. 

The user is not using the drug, but they are talking about their addiction status. The mention of morphine is a drug, but the context is about not being addicted. So maybe this is F, as it's a discussion about addiction, not current use. However, the presence of the drug name might still be T. 

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The key is whether the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. If the user is not currently using, but the drug is mentioned, maybe it's F. But if the mention of the drug is part of the discussion, maybe it's F. 

Alternatively, maybe the mention of morphine is considered as showing drug use. But the user is not using it, just discussing their status. So perhaps F. 

Wait, the rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the user is not using, but the drug is mentioned, maybe it's not T. Unless the mention is in a way that implies use. 

In this case, the user says they're not addicted to morphine, which might imply past use. But the label is for showing current use. So maybe F. 

Alternatively, the presence of the drug name is considered as showing drug use, so T. 

I think the answer is T because the text mentions morphine, which is a drug. Even if the user is not currently using it, the mention of the drug itself might be considered as showing drug use. But the rules might be more about explicit use. 

Alternatively, the user is talking about not being addicted, which is a discussion about addiction, so F. 

I think the correct label here is T because the text mentions morphine, which is a drug. Even if the user is not currently using it, the presence of the drug name might be considered as showing drug use. But I'm not 100% sure. However, based on the rules, if the text shows any mention of the drug, it's T. 

Wait, the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use". So if the text is about drug use, even if it's not current, but the mention of the drug is part of the discussion. 

But in this case, the user is talking about not being addicted, which is a medical or policy discussion. So maybe F. 

Alternatively, the mention of morphine is a drug, so T. 

This is a bit ambiguous, but I think the answer is T because the text includes the drug name. However, if the context is about not being addicted, maybe it's F. 

I think the correct answer is T.
