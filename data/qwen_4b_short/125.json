Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post mentions "Cephalon Receives FDA Approval for Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for FENTORA and ACTIQ signs of drug abuse." 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, it's about a company, Cephalon, getting FDA approval for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for two drugs: FENTORA and ACTIQ. The mention of "signs of drug abuse" is part of the REMS. 

FENTORA and ACTIQ are both brand names for fentanyl, which is a potent opioid used for pain management. The FDA approval here is about managing the risks associated with these medications, especially their potential for abuse. The post is news about regulatory approval, not about actual drug use. 

The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use or just the regulatory measures. The term "signs of drug abuse" is part of the REMS, which is a medical or policy-related discussion. The post isn't indicating that someone is using, selling, or seeking drugs, but rather that a company has been approved for a strategy to mitigate abuse risks. 

So, according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's a news item about FDA approval and drug abuse prevention measures, not actual drug use. The mention of "signs of drug abuse" is part of the regulatory context, not a statement about current drug use. Therefore, the correct label is F.
