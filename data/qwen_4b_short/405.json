Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Because every cop's a racist and nobody ever dies from drug overdose. Tom Petty died in his sleep from opioids, very sad." 

First, I need to check if the post contains any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the first part talks about cops being racist and nobody dying from drug overdose. The second part mentions Tom Petty dying from opioids. Opioids are a category of drugs, specifically including opioids like morphine, heroin, etc. The phrase "died from opioids" directly refers to drug use. 

But wait, the user's instruction says to label T if the text shows drug use. The mention of opioids here is a direct reference to drug use. However, the first part of the post is about cops and racism, which might be a metaphor or unrelated. But the second part is a factual statement about a person's death from opioids. 

So, the key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. The mention of opioids is a drug, so that would be T. The first part is more about a political statement, but the second part is about a drug-related death. Since the post includes a statement about drug use (opioids), it should be labeled T. 

But wait, the user's example might have different nuances. The user might be testing if the mention of opioids is considered a drug use. Since opioids are drugs, and the post states that Tom Petty died from them, that's a direct reference to drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
