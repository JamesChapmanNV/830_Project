Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Probably took a lot of drugs. Methamphetamine Morphine Etc". 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The first sentence says "Probably took a lot of drugs." The word "took" here is a clear indication of using drugs. Then the list includes Methamphetamine and Morphine, which are both illicit drugs. The "Etc" at the end might imply there are more drugs listed, but even with just those two, it's enough to trigger the T label.

I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. The post isn't discussing medical use or policy. It's directly stating that the person used drugs. So according to the rules, this should be labeled T. The answer should just be T without any extra text.
