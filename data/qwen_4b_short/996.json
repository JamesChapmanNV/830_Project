Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "get those tablets with paracetamol and codeine. Will sort you right out". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key terms here are "paracetamol" and "codeine". Paracetamol is a common over-the-counter medication, but when combined with codeine, it's a prescription medication used for pain relief. However, codeine is an opioid, and when mixed with paracetamol, it can be a controlled substance. The phrase "get those tablets" suggests someone is seeking to obtain these medications, which could be for misuse. 

The phrase "Will sort you right out" is a bit unclear. It might be a slang term or a metaphor. But considering the context of the other words, it could imply that the person is trying to help someone with a problem, maybe through drug use. However, the main point is whether the text shows drug use. 

Since the post mentions obtaining tablets containing paracetamol and codeine, which are drugs, and the context might imply misuse (like using them for non-medical purposes), this would fall under T. However, I need to check if it's just a medical discussion. But the mention of "sort you right out" might be a slang for getting rid of a problem, which could be a euphemism for drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe the person is talking about getting medication for a legitimate medical issue. But the presence of codeine, which is a controlled substance, and the context of getting them could indicate seeking for misuse. 

I think the correct label here is T because the post is about obtaining drugs (paracetamol and codeine) which are related to drug use, and the context might imply misuse. Even if it's a medical context, the mention of codeine and paracetamol together could be a red flag for abuse. So the answer should be T.
