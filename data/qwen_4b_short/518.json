Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The post says, "I think so it's paracetamol based isn't it? With codeine supplement. Dr Google?" 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The user is talking about paracetamol and codeine. Paracetamol is a common over-the-counter medication, and codeine is an opioid often used in combination with paracetamol for pain relief. However, codeine can be a controlled substance depending on the dosage and context. But in this case, the user is referring to it as a supplement, which might be a misunderstanding.

Wait, the key here is whether the post indicates actual drug use. The user is questioning if the medication is paracetamol with codeine, possibly referring to a combination product like a painkiller. They mention "Dr Google," which suggests they're consulting the internet for information, not necessarily using drugs. There's no explicit mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or slang for drugs. The terms used are medical, discussing a possible medication combination. So, it's more of a medical discussion rather than drug abuse. Therefore, the label should be F.
