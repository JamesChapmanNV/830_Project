Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about discussing pain medications. The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. 

First, I need to check if any of the drugs mentioned are considered illicit or if there's any indication of abuse. The post mentions Oxy (which is oxycontin, a prescription opioid), Morphine, Norco (which is oxycodone), and Ibuptofen. Wait, Ibuptofen might be a typo. Maybe they meant ibuprofen? But even if it's a typo, ibuprofen is a common OTC pain reliever. 

The user is talking about different pain medications, comparing their effectiveness. They mention that Oxy isn't good long-term, and that higher doses of other meds like Morphine, Norco, or even Ibuprofen work better. They also advise consulting a PCP. 

Now, the rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post is discussing medical use of prescription drugs. There's no mention of abuse, misuse, or slang. The person is talking about medical treatment options. Even though opioids are controlled substances, the context here is about medical advice, not abuse or illicit use. 

So, the label should be F because it's a medical discussion, not about drug abuse. The mention of specific drugs is in a medical context, not indicating their misuse or illegal use. The user is advising someone to consult a doctor, which is within the F category.
