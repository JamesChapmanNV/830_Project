Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about drug use, specifically mentioning habitual users, overdose, and Floyd's blood concentration. 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "habitual users," "overdose," and "concentration in Floyd's blood." The mention of habitual users implies regular drug use, which would fall under T. Also, talking about overdose is directly related to drug use. Even though the post is discussing a medical or autopsy context, the presence of terms like "using," "overdose," and "habitual users" clearly indicates T. The autopsies not citing overdose as a cause of death might be a point of contention, but the fact that the text is discussing drug use and its consequences still classifies it as T. So the label should be T.
