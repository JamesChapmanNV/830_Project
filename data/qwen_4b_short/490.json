Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "hard to believe DMX died from an overdose? Really now?" 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post is questioning the cause of DMX's death, specifically mentioning an overdose. DMX was a rapper who died from an opioid overdose, which is a drug-related cause. The phrase "died from an overdose" directly refers to drug use. The question is about the cause of death, which is related to drug abuse. 

So, the key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. Since the user is talking about an overdose, which is a direct result of drug use, this would fall under T. The post isn't just a metaphor or a medical discussion; it's directly referencing drug-related death. Therefore, the label should be T.
