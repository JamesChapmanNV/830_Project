Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I look like a part time drug dealer who's got no authority with the opps". 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user is talking about looking like a part-time drug dealer. The key words here are "drug dealer" and "no authority with the opps". "Drug dealer" directly relates to selling drugs, which falls under trafficking or selling. The phrase "no authority with the opps" might be a typo or slang, but "opps" could be a misspelling of "ops" (operations) or maybe "opps" as in "oppps" (a slang term for something else?), but even if it's a typo, the main point is the mention of being a drug dealer.

Since the post explicitly mentions being a part-time drug dealer, that's a clear indication of involvement in drug trafficking or selling. Even if the rest of the sentence is unclear, the presence of "drug dealer" is enough to label this as T. The other part about "no authority" might be about their role or status, but the key term is "drug dealer".

So according to the rules, this should be labeled T. The user isn't just discussing drugs in a metaphorical sense or talking about policy; they're directly referring to themselves as a drug dealer, which is a direct mention of drug trafficking. Therefore, the correct label is T.
