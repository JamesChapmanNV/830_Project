Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "the morphine shot was cool but all bc we can't see zendaya tittes IM CRYINGGGG #Euphoria". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "morphine shot". Morphine is a controlled substance, typically used in medical settings. However, the context here is a bit tricky. The user is talking about a "morphine shot" in a casual, possibly humorous way. The rest of the post mentions Zendaya's Tits and crying, which seems unrelated. 

But wait, the label rules specify that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Morphine is a drug, but is the post indicating use? The phrase "the morphine shot was cool" could be seen as referring to the drug itself, but the reason given is about not seeing Zendaya's Tits, which is a red herring. The user is probably using the morphine shot as a metaphor or in a non-literal way. 

However, the presence of "morphine shot" might still trigger the T label because it's a drug. But I need to check if it's being used in a way that indicates use. The post says "was cool" which could be a slang or a metaphor. Alternatively, maybe the person is talking about using morphine. But the main point is the context. The rest of the post is about Zendaya and crying, which is unrelated. 

Wait, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so even if the morphine is mentioned, if it's not in the context of use, maybe it's F. But the rules say T if it's using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. So if "morphine shot" is being used as slang, then it's T. However, in this case, the user is talking about the morphine shot in a way that's not necessarily about using it. They might be referring to a medical context or a metaphor. 

But the problem is that "morphine shot" is a term that could be associated with drug use. However, the rest of the post doesn't indicate that. The user is more focused on the Zendaya part. So maybe the T is not applicable here. Therefore, the label would be F because the main content isn't about drug use but about a different topic. 

Alternatively, if the morphine shot is part of the context, even if it's not directly about use, but the presence of the drug name might still be considered. But according to the rules, it's only T if it's showing illicit or abusive drug use. Since the post is more about Zendaya and crying, the morphine shot might be a red herring. So the answer is F.
