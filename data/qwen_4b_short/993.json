Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "LOL, at says on Brokerage - "Wiggy Makes Money - No1 Else!""

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, the main part is "Wiggy Makes Money - No1 Else!" The user mentions "Brokerage," which might be a financial context. The term "Wiggy" could be a typo or a slang term. Wait, "Wiggy" isn't a common slang for drugs. Maybe it's a brand name or a username. The phrase "Makes Money" is about financial success, not drugs. There's no mention of drugs, their use, sale, or related terms. The rest of the text is about a brokerage comment, which is unrelated to drug abuse. 

So, there's no indication of drug use here. The label should be F. I need to make sure there's no hidden slang or metaphor. "Wiggy" might be a misspelling of "wiggly" or something else, but even if it's a slang term, there's no evidence it refers to drugs. The context is financial, so it's definitely F.
