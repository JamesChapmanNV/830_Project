Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Utica woman arrested after troopers discover heroin in vehicle during traffic stop."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, it's reporting an event where a woman was arrested because heroin was found in her vehicle during a traffic stop. The key words here are "heroin," which is a Schedule I controlled substance, clearly an illicit drug. The post is factual, stating that heroin was discovered, leading to an arrest. There's no mention of personal use, seeking, buying, selling, or any slang. It's just a news headline about a drug-related arrest. 

Since the post directly mentions the presence of heroin (an illicit drug) and the arrest related to it, this falls under the T category. The other cases (F) would be if it were discussing medical aspects, policy, news about drug laws, or if it were using drugs metaphorically. Here, it's a straightforward report of drug discovery leading to an arrest, so T is the correct label.
