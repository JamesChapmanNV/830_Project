Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F. The post is about "Heroin-coaked yarn" and how traffickers smuggled ₹450 crores worth of heroin into India. 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post is a news article title. It's talking about how traffickers smuggled a large amount of heroin into India. The key words here are "heroin," "traffickers," "smuggled," and "₹450 cr worth." 

Since the post is about the trafficking of heroin, which is an illicit drug, this would fall under T. The article is reporting on the method used by traffickers to move drugs into the country, which directly relates to drug abuse and trafficking. There's no mention of medical use, policy discussion, or anything else that would fit F. The title itself is about the smuggling of heroin, which is a clear case of drug trafficking. So the label should be T.
