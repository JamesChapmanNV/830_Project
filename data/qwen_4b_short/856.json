Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label each post as T or F based on whether it's about drug use. The post here is talking about businessmen like Anil Agarwal, Gautam Adani, and Ritesh Agarwal. They mention their backgrounds and encourage entrepreneurship. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any related terms. The keywords for T are things like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since none of those words are present here, the label should be F. The post is about business and entrepreneurship, so it's definitely F.
