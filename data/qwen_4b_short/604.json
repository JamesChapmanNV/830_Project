Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: ""The internet is saturated with it" I need more. I need to write him 100 pages worth of bad fanfic on ao3. I need comics of him and Morgott in the sewers. I need to inject cloudycats' i will tell you of the sun directly into my bloodstream like pure heroin."

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the user says "inject cloudycats' i will tell you of the sun directly into my bloodstream like pure heroin." The phrase "like pure heroin" is a direct mention of heroin, which is an illicit drug. Even though the rest of the post talks about fanfiction and comics, the mention of heroin clearly falls under T. 

The other parts of the post are about creating content, which is not related to drug use. However, the key here is that the user is using heroin as a metaphor or literal? The phrase "like pure heroin" is a comparison, but the actual mention of heroin as a drug is sufficient to label it as T. 

So the answer should be T because it explicitly mentions heroin, which is an illicit drug.
