Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "I catch people's humor so good I laugh at a lot of shitðŸ˜‚". 

First, I need to check if this post relates to drug use. The rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about catching people's humor and laughing at a lot of shit. The words here are about humor and laughing, which doesn't mention any drugs. There's no mention of drugs, drug-related activities, or slang for drugs. The phrase "laugh at a lot of shit" is a metaphor for finding humor in unpleasant things, not a reference to drug use. 

So, there's no indication of drug use here. The post is about humor and laughter, which falls under the F category. Therefore, the label should be F.
