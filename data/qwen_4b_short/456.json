Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Dude‚Ä¶. Stop toking the crack pipe and worry about yourself. We did the tough yards and we are relaxing in the glory üòÅ"

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key phrases are "toking the crack pipe." "Toking" is a slang term for using tobacco or drugs, and "crack pipe" refers to a crack pipe, which is a slang term for using crack cocaine. So that's definitely a direct reference to drug use. 

The rest of the message is about stopping the drug use and relaxing, but the main action here is the mention of using crack. The other parts are more about the consequences or a warning, but the key part is the drug reference. 

So according to the rules, since there's a direct mention of using crack (which is an illicit drug), this should be labeled T. The other parts are just context, but the main action is drug use. 

I need to make sure there's no other possible interpretation. "Tough yards" might be a metaphor, but the main point is the drug use. The label is T.
