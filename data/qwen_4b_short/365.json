Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post "You must be smoking crack to believe that!" as either T or F based on the given rules. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to analyze the sentence. The phrase "smoking crack" is a direct mention of a specific drug. Crack is a type of illicit drug, so that's a clear reference to drug use. The sentence is using "smoking crack" as a slang term, which falls under the T category because it's directly referring to the use of an illicit drug. 

But wait, is there any possibility that this is a metaphor? The sentence is saying that someone must be using crack to believe something, which could be a metaphor for being irrational or crazy. However, the presence of the actual drug name "crack" in the sentence makes it more likely that it's a direct reference to drug use rather than a metaphor. 

Also, the rules include slang for drugs as T. "Smoking crack" is a common slang term for using the drug. So even if the sentence is a metaphor, the explicit mention of the drug name would still trigger the T label. 

Therefore, the correct label here is T.
