Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "I'm on the codeine moving like a dead body #nofr". The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, or F for other cases.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use. The user says they're on codeine. Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered illicit or abusive in the context of drug abuse. The phrase "moving like a dead body" is a common metaphor for the effects of drugs, especially opioids, which can cause drowsiness and sluggishness. However, the hashtag #nofr might be a typo or slang. Wait, #nofr could stand for "no filter" or maybe something else, but in this context, it's probably not relevant. 

The key part here is "I'm on the codeine". That directly indicates the use of a drug. Even if the user is using it for medical purposes, the label rules specify that T includes any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since codeine is a drug and the user is stating they are on it, that's a clear T. The metaphor part might be a red herring, but the direct mention of the drug is enough. So the label should be T.
