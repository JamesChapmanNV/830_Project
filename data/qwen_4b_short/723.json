Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "and I'm sippin on that codeine, not Brady ðŸ˜ˆ".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "codeine" and "sippin on". Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medicinal contexts but also misused. The phrase "sippin on" is slang for drinking or consuming something, which in this case is codeine. The mention of "not Brady" might be a typo or a reference to someone named Brady, but the main focus is on codeine.

According to the rules, T is for any text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Codeine is a drug, and the action here is consuming it. The slang "sippin on" is a way of saying taking or drinking it. So this would fall under T. The other part, "not Brady", doesn't seem related to drug use, so it's probably just a comment or a joke. But the main point is the codeine. Therefore, the label should be T.
