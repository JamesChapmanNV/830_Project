Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about NICE promoting NPS (which I think stands for New Psychoactive Substances) and mentions the opioid crisis. The hashtag #investigateNPS is there.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The term "NPS" is a category of substances that are often considered illicit. The mention of the opioid crisis is a reference to the issue of opioid abuse, which is related to drug use. The hashtag #investigateNPS suggests that the post is discussing the use of these substances, which are often associated with drug abuse. 

The post also includes a reference to the CDC's efforts regarding prescription opioid overdoses, which is related to the opioid crisis. However, the main focus here is on NPS. The phrase "poromoting nps in all its ugliness" seems like a critique of NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) promoting these substances. 

Since the post is discussing the use of NPS, which are considered illicit drugs, and the context is about the opioid crisis, which is related to drug abuse, the label should be T. The hashtags #investigateNPS and the mention of NPS in the context of the opioid crisis indicate that the post is related to drug use. Therefore, the correct label is T.
