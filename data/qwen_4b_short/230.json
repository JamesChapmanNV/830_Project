Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Whomever coined the phrase:'Out of the frying pan and into the fire' was on Codeine & tried combatting its costive effects with prune juice".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Codeine" and "prune juice" in the context of combating constipation. Codeine is a controlled substance, a narcotic, and is used medically but also has potential for abuse. The phrase mentions someone using codeine and then using prune juice to counteract its constipating effects.

So, the post is talking about someone who was on codeine, which is a drug. The mention of codeine directly points to drug use. Even though the context is about managing side effects, the presence of codeine in the text would trigger the T label. The other part about prune juice is just a common remedy for constipation, but the main point is the use of codeine. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphorical use here. The phrase "Out of the frying pan and into the fire" is a common idiom, but the post is attributing the creation of that phrase to someone who was on codeine. The mention of codeine is explicit, so it's a direct reference to drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
