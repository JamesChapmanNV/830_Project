Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about Covidien launching a generic version of Actiq. First, I need to recall what Actiq is. Actiq is a brand-name medication that contains fentanyl, which is a potent opioid used for pain management. The post mentions a generic version, which would be a cheaper alternative.

Now, the rules: T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post here is a news headline about a company launching a generic drug. There's no mention of drug use, abuse, or any slang. It's just informing about a pharmaceutical company's action. The mention of Actiq is a medication, not necessarily related to illicit use. Even though fentanyl is a controlled substance, the context here is about a generic version being released, which is a medical/healthcare topic. So this would fall under F because it's a news item about a drug product, not about drug abuse or illicit use. The label should be F.
