Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "I just figured out my sister's friend has over 100k subscribers on YouTube wth". The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, or F for other cases.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key here is to look for any direct or indirect references to drugs. The post talks about someone's sister's friend having a large number of YouTube subscribers. The "wth" is an interjection, probably meaning "what the hell" or expressing confusion. 

Now, does this post relate to drug use? The mention of YouTube subscribers doesn't directly relate to drugs. The person is talking about someone's online presence, maybe expressing surprise or confusion about the number of followers. There's no mention of drugs, drug slang, or any activity related to drug use. The "wth" is just an exclamation, not a slang term for drugs. 

So, the post is about someone's YouTube channel's subscriber count, which is a social media topic. There's no indication of drug use here. Therefore, the label should be F, as it's not related to drug abuse. The user might be confused about the friend's online presence, but there's no drug-related content in the text.
