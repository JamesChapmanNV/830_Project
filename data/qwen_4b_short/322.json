Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "50 Kg Heroin, Rs 30 Lakh Cash Seized From Delhi's Shaheen Bagh *Read More* ðŸ‘‡"

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, it mentions "50 Kg Heroin" and "Rs 30 Lakh Cash Seized". The key words here are "Heroin" which is a drug, and the context is about seizing it. The location is Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, which might be a reference to a protest area, but the main content is about the seizure of drugs and cash. 

The post is reporting on the seizure of heroin, which is a controlled substance. This is related to drug trafficking or illegal drug use. The mention of the quantity (50 kg) and the cash (Rs 30 lakh) suggests that this is a case of drug trafficking, which is part of the illicit drug use category. 

The rules state that T includes trafficking. So even though the post is a news headline about a seizure, the content directly relates to drug trafficking. Therefore, the label should be T.
