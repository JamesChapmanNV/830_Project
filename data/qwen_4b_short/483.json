Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "RT : Codeine Crazy makes me want to shed tears and turn up at the same time. 'We been through a lot, but we still here' music."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Codeine Crazy." Codeine is a controlled substance, classified as a Schedule II drug in the US, which is considered illicit or abusive. The phrase "Codeine Crazy" might be a slang term or a reference to the effects of codeine. The user mentions that codeine makes them want to shed tears and turn up at the same time. "Turn up" could be a slang term for using drugs, especially in the context of music or drug use. 

The second part of the post is about music, which is unrelated. The main focus here is on the mention of codeine and its effects. Since codeine is a drug, and the post is discussing its use and effects, this would fall under T. The other parts of the post don't mention anything else related to drug use. The "RT" is a retweet, but that doesn't affect the label. The key is whether the text shows drug use. So, the answer should be T.
