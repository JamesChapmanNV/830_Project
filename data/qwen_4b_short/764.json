Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says, "im making a heartstopper on crack video and im just laughing at myself like an idiotðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to parse the sentence. The key part here is "heartstopper on crack". "Heartstopper" is a slang term, right? Wait, "heartstopper" can mean something that's extremely exciting or thrilling, but in this context, it's likely referring to a video that's intense or shocking. But the main point is "on crack". Crack is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. So the person is making a video about crack, which is directly related to drug use. 

The user is using the term "on crack" which is a direct reference to the drug. Even though they're making a video and laughing at themselves, the act of making a video about using crack would fall under T because it's about drug use. The label should be T. The other parts like laughing at oneself don't change the fact that the content is about using crack. So the answer is T.
