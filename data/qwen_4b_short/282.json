Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is titled "Effect of Sustained-Release Morphine on Patients With COPD and Refractory Breathlessness." 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the title, it's about a study or medical research on morphine's effect on COPD patients with refractory breathlessness. Morphine is a controlled substance, but in this context, it's being discussed in a medical or research setting. The title doesn't mention personal use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. It's more about the medical application of morphine, which is a treatment for severe breathlessness. 

So, since the post is about a medical study and not about drug use or abuse, it should be labeled F. The key here is that the focus is on the effect of a drug in a medical context, not on the use or abuse of drugs. Therefore, the correct label is F.
