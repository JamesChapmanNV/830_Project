Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Baby I can't quit that lean, put a ring all-round codeine". 

First, I need to understand what the terms mean. The label T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: "Baby I can't quit that lean, put a ring all-round codeine". The key words here are "lean" and "codeine". I know that "lean" is a slang term for cocaine, which is an illicit drug. Then "codeine" is an opioid, which is also a controlled substance, often used in medications but considered illicit when abused. The phrase "put a ring all-round" might be a slang expression related to drug use, perhaps referring to a ring or a method of using the drug. 

The user is talking about not being able to quit "that lean", which implies ongoing use. The mention of codeine directly points to drug use. Since both "lean" and "codeine" are associated with drug use, and the context suggests continued use, this would fall under T. There's no indication of medical discussion, news, or metaphor here. The post is clearly about drug use, so the label should be T.
