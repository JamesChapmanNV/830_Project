Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is "Side effects of Actiq - by Dr Pandula Siribaddana - Helium". 

First, I need to understand what the label rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post mentions "Side effects of Actiq". Actiq is a medication that contains fentanyl, which is a potent opioid used for pain management. However, fentanyl is a controlled substance and can be misused, leading to addiction or overdose. But the post is specifically about side effects, not about using or seeking the drug. It's a medical discussion by a doctor, so it's likely a legitimate health information post.

The name "Dr Pandula Siribaddana" suggests a medical professional, and "Helium" might be a platform or a typo. The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use or just the medical aspects. Since it's about side effects, which is a medical topic, it falls under F. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. Therefore, the label should be F.
