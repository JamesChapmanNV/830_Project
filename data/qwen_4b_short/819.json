Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Morphine will put you on your ass by force ngl. That's the shit they had me on when I broke my leg."

First, I need to check if this falls under the T category, which includes text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, such as using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The F category is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user mentions "Morphine," which is a controlled substance, typically used medically. However, the phrase "put you on your ass by force" seems like a slang or metaphorical way of describing the side effects of morphine, possibly in a humorous or exaggerated way. The phrase "That's the shit they had me on" refers to the drug being prescribed when the person broke their leg. 

But wait, the key here is whether the post is showing drug use. The user is talking about their experience with morphine, which is a drug. However, the context is a personal account of medical treatment. The term "shit" here is slang, but in this case, it's referring to the drug they were prescribed. The question is whether this is considered T or F. 

The rules specify that T includes slang for drugs. So "shit" here might be slang for a drug. But the main point is that the user is discussing their experience with morphine, which is a drug. However, the post is about the side effects of a medical drug, not necessarily about using or seeking it. The user is not engaging in drug use but rather talking about a medical treatment. 

But the second part says "That's the shit they had me on when I broke my leg." The word "shit" here is slang for a drug. So the post is using slang to refer to morphine, which is a drug. Therefore, this would fall under T because it's using slang for drugs. However, the context is medical, but the label rules might consider the use of slang as T regardless of the context. 

Alternatively, if the post is discussing a medical drug, maybe it's F. But the rules say T includes slang for drugs. So even if it's a medical drug, if the user is using slang, it's T. 

Wait, the label rules are about text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the post is about using a drug (morphine) in a medical context, but the user is referring to it with slang, does that count as T? The rules mention "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the user is using slang for drugs, that's T. 

In this case, "the shit they had me on" is slang for the drug. So even though it's a medical drug, the use of slang would make it T. Therefore, the label should be T.
