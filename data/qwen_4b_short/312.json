Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "I'm like ma'am please give me all the Oxy and Morphine. Fuck that Tylenol lol."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is asking for Oxy and Morphine. Both of these are opioids, which are controlled substances and considered illicit drugs. The mention of "Oxy" (Oxycontin) and "Morphine" clearly points to drugs. The phrase "please give me all the Oxy and Morphine" indicates seeking or requesting these drugs, which falls under T. 

The part "Fuck that Tylenol" is a bit more complex. Tylenol is acetaminophen, which is a common over-the-counter medication. The user is dismissing Tylenol, possibly because it's not as strong or they prefer the opioids. However, the key here is that the main request is for Oxy and Morphine, which are drugs. The Tylenol part is more of a contrast or a statement, but since the primary focus is on the drugs, the label should be T.

Also, the use of "ma'am" might be a casual way of addressing someone, maybe a pharmacist or a healthcare provider. The overall tone is demanding, which could be a sign of drug-seeking behavior. There's no mention of medical use or policy, so it's not F. The slang "Fuck that" is more of an expression of preference rather than a metaphor, but the main subject is still drugs. 

Therefore, the correct label should be T.
