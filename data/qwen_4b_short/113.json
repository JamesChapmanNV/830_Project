Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about Tylenol and its effects on the liver, mentioning overdose and the importance of education.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Tylenol" and "overdose." Tylenol is a common over-the-counter medication, not an illicit drug. The post is discussing the risks of taking too much Tylenol, which can be harmful, but it's not about using or seeking an illegal drug. The mention of "Guns and Tylenol" might be a metaphor, but the main point is about the dangers of misuse of a legal medication. The post is warning against overdose, which is a medical concern, not drug abuse. So according to the rules, T is for drug use, and F is for medical discussions. This seems like a medical/policy discussion, so the label should be F.
