Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "You can see the codeine in this mans eyes ðŸ’€". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "codeine", which is a drug. Codeine is an opioid, and it's classified as an illicit drug. The phrase "in this mans eyes" might be a metaphor, but the presence of the drug name itself is a red flag. Also, the emoji ðŸ’€ adds a strong emotional reaction, which might indicate the person is trying to convey the severity of the drug use.

The rules state that T includes any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Codeine is a drug, so even if it's not explicitly stated that someone is using it, the mention of the drug in the context of someone's eyes could be considered as showing drug use. However, I need to be careful here. If the post is just describing someone's eyes as having codeine, maybe it's a metaphor or a misunderstanding. But in the context of drug abuse moderation, any mention of the drug itself would trigger a T label. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is trying to say that the person is under the influence, so the eyes show the effects of codeine. But according to the rules, even if it's a metaphor, if the drug is mentioned, it's T. The emoji might be emphasizing the severity, but the main point is the presence of the drug name. 

So, the answer should be T because codeine is an illicit drug and the post mentions it in a context that could imply drug use.
