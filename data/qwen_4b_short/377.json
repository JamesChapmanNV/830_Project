Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label the social media post as T or F. The post is: "let me get a caesar salad please with croutons and codeine dressing". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "codeine dressing". Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug. Even though it's a dressing, the presence of codeine would make it a drug. 

But wait, codeine is sometimes used in medications, like in some cough syrups. However, in the context of a salad dressing, it's not a typical use. The label rules mention slang for drugs, so codeine is a drug. The post is about ordering a salad with codeine dressing, which directly references the drug. So that would fall under T.

But I need to make sure there's no other context. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Codeine is a drug, so even if it's in a dressing, it's still a drug. Therefore, the label should be T.
