Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a historical figure, Yusef Khan Gorji, an Iranian military leader who founded Arak, a city in Iran. It mentions he left Tbilisi (Georgia) after a conflict with Russian Empress Catherine the Great. The question is whether this post shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to check if the post contains any mention of drugs, their use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post talks about a historical figure, military leader, and a city's founding. The key terms here are "Arak," which is a city in Iran, but I should check if "Arak" is a slang term for a drug. Wait, Arak is actually a type of anise-flavored spirit, which is a traditional Iranian drink. However, in some contexts, especially in certain regions, it might be associated with drug use, but I'm not sure. But the post doesn't mention anything about drug use, seeking, buying, etc. It's purely historical information about a person and a city. The mention of Catherine the Great is historical, not related to drugs. The city of Arak is a place, not a drug. Therefore, there's no indication of drug abuse or related activities here. The label should be F because there's no mention of drugs or drug-related activities. The post is about history and geography, so it's a factual statement, not related to drug use.
