Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if DMX's death can be used to bring attention to addiction issues, comparing it to other celebrities who died from overdoses. The label rules are T for drug use-related text and F otherwise.

First, the post mentions DMX's death and using it to highlight addiction. The key here is whether the text directly refers to drug use. The user is discussing the potential use of DMX's death as a metaphor or a way to discuss addiction. There's no explicit mention of drug use, buying, selling, or slang. Instead, it's about using his death as a topic to discuss addiction issues. 

The label rules say T is for text that shows illicit drug use, like using, seeking, buying, etc. The post here is more about the discussion around addiction, not the act of using drugs. So even though DMX was a rapper known for his drug use, the post isn't stating that he used drugs; it's about using his death to discuss addiction. Therefore, it's more of a F because it's a discussion about the topic, not the drug use itself. The answer should be F.
