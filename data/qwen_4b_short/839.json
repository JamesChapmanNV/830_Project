Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says, "Can see me getting hooked on codeine to fall asleep ðŸ˜³". The rules are T if it's about illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang), otherwise F.

First, I need to determine if the post fits the T category. The key words here are "getting hooked on codeine". Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medications but can be abused. The phrase "getting hooked" suggests dependence, which is a sign of abuse. The context is using codeine to fall asleep, which might indicate misuse, possibly for sleep-related issues. The emoji ðŸ˜³ adds emotional context, but the main point is the use of codeine for sleep, which is a form of drug use. 

I need to check if this falls under T. The label T is for any text showing illicit or abusive use. Since codeine is a drug that can be abused, and the person is "getting hooked" on it, that's a clear indication of drug use. Even if it's for a medical purpose (like sleep), the way it's phrased here suggests it's being used abusively. So the label should be T.
