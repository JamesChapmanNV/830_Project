Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "I can't stay on your morphine 'Cause it's making me itch (8)". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to parse the sentence. The main words here are "morphine" and "itch". Morphine is a drug, specifically an opioid, which is classified as an illicit drug. The person is saying they can't stay on the morphine because it's making them itch. 

Now, the question is whether this is T or F. The key is whether the post is showing drug use. The person is talking about using morphine and the effects of it. Morphine is a controlled substance, so it's considered illicit or abusive in the context of drug abuse moderation. The mention of "itch" might be a side effect of morphine, which is a known effect. 

But wait, is morphine considered slang here? No, it's a direct reference to the drug. The person is using morphine, which is a drug, so this would fall under T. The fact that they can't stay on it because of the side effect still indicates drug use. Even if it's a negative effect, the act of using the drug is what's important here. 

So the label should be T. The other options are F if it's medical discussion, but this is more about the user's experience with the drug, which is related to drug use. Therefore, the answer is T.
