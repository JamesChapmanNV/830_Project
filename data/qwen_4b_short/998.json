Okay, let's tackle this label. The post is "Marvel need to base a super hero off of this Nigguh.. "Captain Codeine"".

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The user is talking about a super hero named "Captain Codeine". The name "Codeine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. But is it being used in a way that indicates abuse or illicit use?

The term "Codeine" itself is a controlled substance, so using it in a name might be a reference to drug use. However, the context here is a fictional character. The user is suggesting a superhero based on this name. The word "Nigguh" is likely a racial slur, but the main focus here is on "Captain Codeine".

In the label rules, T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use. Since "Codeine" is a drug, even if it's part of a name, it might be considered T. But I need to check if the post is directly discussing drug use. The post is more about creating a superhero, not explicitly talking about using or seeking codeine. However, the name "Captain Codeine" could be a slang reference or a metaphor. But according to the rules, if the name includes a drug, it might be considered T. Alternatively, if it's just a name, maybe F. But the rules say "slang for drugs" is included in T. So "Codeine" is a drug, so the name might be considered T. However, the user is not necessarily using it in a context of abuse but as a fictional character. But the rules might consider the presence of the drug name as T. So the label would be T.
