Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "if u buy drawls at the thrift you a nasty ass heroin taking fiend ðŸ¤¨".

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. The user is talking about buying "drawls" at a thrift store. Wait, "drawls" might be a typo or slang. Let me think. Maybe they meant "drugs"? Because "drawl" isn't a drug term. But if it's a typo for "drugs", then that's a clue. Alternatively, "drawl" could be a slang term for something else, but I'm not sure. However, the next part is "heroin taking fiend". That's pretty clear. The person is saying that if you buy drugs (assuming "drawls" is a typo for "drugs") at the thrift store, you're a heroin addict.

So the key elements here are the mention of buying drugs (assuming "drawls" is a typo) and calling someone a heroin taking fiend. The rules state that T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The post mentions buying drugs (if "drawls" is a typo for drugs) and refers to heroin use. Even if "drawls" is not a standard term, the context suggests drug use. Also, the mention of "heroin taking fiend" is a direct reference to drug use. Therefore, this post should be labeled T. The other part is the emoji, which is just an expression, but the main content is about drug use. So the answer is T.
