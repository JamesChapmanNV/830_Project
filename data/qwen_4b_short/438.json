Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "All we have left is to crack the 7M curse on yt. The day we surpass crown's views is the day we'll be invincible".

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about "crack the 7M curse" and "surpass crown's views". The term "crack" here might be a slang, but I need to think. "Crack" can refer to the drug crack, but in this context, it's part of a phrase "7M curse". Wait, 7M could be a reference to a YouTube channel or a term related to views. "Crown's views" might be a reference to a specific channel or a metaphor for achieving a certain number of views. The phrase "crack the curse" might be a metaphor for overcoming a challenge, not necessarily related to drugs. The word "invincible" is a metaphor for success. There's no direct mention of drugs, slang, or any activities related to drug use. The user is talking about YouTube views and a curse, which seems like a metaphor for achieving a goal. So according to the rules, if there's no mention of drug-related terms, then it's F. So the label should be F.
