Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking to determine if the social media post is T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). The post is: "I was like codeine? We have codeine she says yeah it's from a few years back when they used to prescribe it gave you a lot".

First, I need to parse the sentence. The person mentions "codeine" and talks about it being prescribed in the past. They say "I was like codeine" which might be a bit unclear. Maybe they're referring to using codeine? But codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medications. However, the key here is whether the post indicates actual use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs.

The phrase "I was like codeine" could be a metaphor or a misunderstanding. The person might be talking about being similar to codeine in some way, but not necessarily using it. Then they mention that codeine was prescribed in the past, which is a medical use. However, the mention of "gave you a lot" might imply that it was used in a way that had significant effects, but that's not necessarily illegal. Codeine is a controlled substance, but it's also used medically. 

But the label rules specify that T includes any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't explicitly state that the person is using codeine. They might be discussing the historical use of codeine in prescriptions. The mention of "gave you a lot" could be a reference to the effects of codeine, but that's not necessarily abuse. However, if the person is talking about using codeine in a way that's not medical, that could be T. But the post doesn't clearly indicate that. It's more about the historical context of codeine being prescribed. 

Alternatively, if the person is using codeine in a slang way, but the sentence doesn't show that. The key is whether the text shows illicit or abusive use. Since the post is about the past use in prescriptions, which is legal medical use, it's more of an F. Unless there's an implication of abuse, but the text doesn't state that. So the label should be F.
