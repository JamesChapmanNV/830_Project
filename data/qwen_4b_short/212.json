Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "if you wanna touch the spot my cups got codeine in it and mine be straight mud i po more lean in it". 

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. The mention of "codeine" is a drug, so that's a red flag. Then there's "mud", which I think is slang for marijuana. The phrase "i po more lean in it" â€“ "po" is slang for "to use" or "to take", and "lean" here might refer to a type of drug, possibly methamphetamine. 

So the post is talking about having codeine in cups, using mud (marijuana), and taking lean (meth). The user is discussing the use of drugs, specifically mentioning different types. According to the label rules, T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The post doesn't mention medical use or policy discussions. It's more about personal drug use. The mention of "codeine" is definitely a drug, and the other terms are slang for drugs. So this should be labeled T. I need to make sure there's no metaphor here. The context seems to be about using drugs, so it's T.
