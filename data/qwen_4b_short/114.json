Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F. The post lists three songs: Kanye West's "Flashing Lights," Snoop Dogg's "Sensual Seduction," and Future's "Codeine Crazy." The label rules are T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to check each song title for any drug-related terms. "Flashing Lights" by Kanye Westâ€”doesn't seem like a drug reference. "Sensual Seduction" by Snoop Dogg... Snoop Dogg is known for his music, but "Sensual Seduction" might be a song title, not necessarily related to drugs. Then "Codeine Crazy" by Future. Wait, "Codeine" is a drug, right? Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. So the song title includes "Codeine," which is a slang term for a drug. But is the song title directly indicating drug use? Or is it just using the word "codeine" as part of the title?

The label rule says if the text shows drug use, like slang for drugs. So if the song title is using "codeine" as a slang term, then it would be T. But "Codeine Crazy" might be a song title that's just using the word codeine as part of the title, not necessarily indicating that the song is about drug use. However, the term "codeine" is a drug, so if the title includes it, maybe that's considered a slang term for drugs. 

Alternatively, maybe the song is about codeine, which is a drug. But the user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the title uses the name of a drug, even if it's just a title, it might be considered T. But I need to check if the post is directly showing drug use. The post is just listing songs, not discussing their content. However, the song title "Codeine Crazy" might be using "codeine" as a slang term. So according to the rules, if the text shows slang for drugs, then it's T. So "Codeine" is a drug, so the title includes that. Therefore, the label would be T. But wait, the other songs don't have drug terms. So the third song's title has a drug term, so the entire post would be T? Or is it only if the text shows drug use. The post is just listing songs, but the third song's title includes a drug. So the answer would be T? Or is it F because the post isn't discussing drug use, just mentioning song titles that include the word codeine? 

Hmm. The rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So if the song title uses "codeine" as a slang term, then it's T. But is "codeine" considered slang for drugs? Codeine is a drug, so it's a slang term for a drug. So the title includes a drug name, so the text shows slang for drugs. Therefore, the label is T. But maybe the user is considering that the song title is not about drug use but just using the word codeine as part of the title. But according to the rules, if the text includes the slang for drugs, then it's T. So the answer should be T. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the song title is just a title and not indicating drug use, so it's F. But the rules are a bit ambiguous. However, given that "codeine" is a drug, and the title includes it, it's T. So the answer is T.
