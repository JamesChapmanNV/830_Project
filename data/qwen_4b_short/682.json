Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "whaaat? endorphins are peptides? i thought they would look like morphine". 

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about endorphins and morphine. Endorphins are naturally occurring peptides in the body that act as neurotransmitters, and morphine is an opioid drug. The user is confused about whether endorphins look like morphine. But the key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. 

The user is not talking about using drugs, seeking them, buying, selling, or using slang. Instead, they're discussing the biological aspect of endorphins and morphine. This seems like a medical or scientific discussion. The mention of morphine is part of a comparison, not an indication of drug use. There's no explicit mention of drug use, trafficking, or any slang. The user is just expressing confusion about the structure of endorphins versus morphine. 

So, according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's a medical discussion, not related to drug abuse or illicit use. The user isn't promoting or discussing drug use, just clarifying a scientific fact. Therefore, the correct label is F.
