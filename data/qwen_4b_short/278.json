Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "It's crazy that heroin in all forms is legal now." 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

So the post is talking about heroin being legal. Heroin is an illicit drug, right? But the post isn't about using or seeking it. It's more of a statement about the legality of heroin. The user is expressing surprise that heroin is legal, which might be a reference to some policy change or misinformation. But does this count as T? The key is whether the text shows drug use. The post doesn't mention using heroin, but rather its legality. 

Wait, the user is talking about heroin being legal. But heroin is an illegal drug in most places. If the post is saying that heroin is now legal, that might be a false statement or a misunderstanding. However, the label rules are about whether the text shows drug use. The post isn't about using heroin, but rather discussing its legality. So maybe this is a policy discussion, which would be F. Unless the post is implying that heroin is being used or sold because it's legal, but the post doesn't mention that. It just states that heroin is legal. 

So the answer would be F because it's a statement about the legality of a drug, not about its use. The user is not discussing using, seeking, buying, selling, or slang for drugs. They're talking about the legal status, which is a policy or news-related topic. Therefore, the label should be F.
