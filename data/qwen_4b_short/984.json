Okay, let's tackle this label. The post is: "Rue isn't human...how tf do you bounce back from morphine like that #Euphoria". The user is asking if the post should be labeled T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases).

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use. The key words here are "morphine". Morphine is a potent opioid, which is an illicit drug. The user is talking about bouncing back from morphine, which implies that someone has used morphine and is trying to recover. The mention of "morphine" directly points to drug use. 

Also, the hashtag #Euphoria might be a reference to the TV show "Euphoria", which has characters dealing with drug use, especially opioids. But the main focus here is the mention of morphine. Even if the context is a show, the actual text mentions the drug. 

So, the post is discussing the use of morphine, which is an illicit drug. Therefore, it should be labeled T. The other elements like "Rue isn't human" are probably metaphorical or part of the show's narrative, but the key is the mention of morphine. 

I need to make sure there's no medical context here. However, morphine is also used medically, but in this case, the context is about bouncing back from it, which suggests abuse or addiction. The user is asking how to recover from using morphine, which is a sign of drug use. 

Therefore, the correct label is T.
