Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking whether the post should be labeled T or F. The post is about whether it's okay to mock someone who accidentally dies from an overdose compared to someone who intentionally kills themselves, like Robin Williams or Anthony Bourdain.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about overdose and suicide, but it's not explicitly mentioning any drugs. The key terms here are "over dose" and "cowardly kills the self." The user is discussing the morality of mocking someone who died accidentally from an overdose versus someone who intentionally took their own life. 

The label rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use. The post doesn't directly mention using drugs, buying them, or any slang. It's more about the ethical discussion around public shaming in such cases. The mention of overdose could be related to drug use, but the post isn't stating that the person used drugs, just that they died from an overdose. However, the main focus is on the reaction to the death, not the drug use itself.

So, the post is discussing a moral issue, not directly about drug use. Therefore, it doesn't fit the T category. The answer should be F.
