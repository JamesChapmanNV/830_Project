Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking to determine if the given social media post falls under T (illicit drug use) or F (other cases). The post is: "We really gonna keep glorifying mfers that die from an Overdose at 50 years old? Nah! Not me". 

First, I need to understand the content. The person is talking about glorifying people (mfers, which is slang for "my friends" or "members") who die from an overdose at 50. The key terms here are "overdose" and "die from an overdose". 

Now, the label rules: T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

The post is discussing the issue of people dying from overdoses, which is related to drug use. However, the main point here is about the public glorification of such deaths, not the act of using drugs. The person is expressing a view against glorifying those who die from overdoses, not necessarily discussing the use of drugs themselves. 

But wait, the term "overdose" is a direct reference to drug use. However, the post is more about the societal reaction to such deaths rather than the act of using drugs. The user is not describing someone using drugs, but rather commenting on the media or public's glorification of those who died from overdoses. 

So, is the post about drug use (T) or something else (F)? The key is whether the text shows the act of using, seeking, buying, etc. The post doesn't mention using drugs, but rather the consequence of drug use (overdose). However, the term "overdose" is a slang term for drug use. 

But the label rules include "slang for drugs" as part of T. So if the post uses "overdose" as slang, then it would be T. However, the post is not about the use of drugs, but about the glorification of people who died from overdoses. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is a metaphor. But the user is not using metaphor here; they are directly referring to overdoses. 

Wait, the label rules say T includes "slang for drugs". So "overdose" is a direct term related to drug use. However, the post is not about the use of drugs, but about the reaction to people who died from overdoses. 

Hmm. The question is whether the text "shows illicit or abusive drug use". The post is not showing the act of using drugs, but rather the consequence. However, the term "overdose" is a result of drug use. 

But according to the rules, if the text is about drug use (using, seeking, buying, etc.), then it's T. If it's about the consequence, maybe it's F. But the term "overdose" is a slang for drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is discussing the issue of drug overdoses, which is a medical or policy topic. However, the user is not discussing the medical aspect but rather the glorification of those who die from it. 

But the label rules say that F includes "discouraging use" or "metaphor". Since the post is not directly about using drugs but about the societal reaction, it might be F. However, the term "overdose" is a direct reference to drug use. 

This is a bit tricky. Let me check the rules again. The T label includes any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. So if the post uses terms related to drug use, even if it's not the act itself, but the consequence, does that count? 

In this case, the post is talking about people who died from overdoses, which is a result of drug use. However, the post is not about the act of using drugs, but about the societal reaction. Therefore, maybe it's F, as it's a discussion about the consequences rather than the act of using. 

But the term "overdose" is a slang for drug use. However, the post is not using "overdose" as slang for drugs but as a consequence. So maybe it's F. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is about the use of drugs, since overdoses are a result of drug use. But the label is about whether the text shows the use. 

The post is not showing the use, but the consequence. So perhaps it's F. However, the term "overdose" is part of the drug use context. 

I think the correct label here is F because the post is discussing the societal reaction to drug overdoses, not the act of using drugs. The key is whether the text shows the act of using, seeking, etc. Since the post is not about that, but about the consequence, it's F.
