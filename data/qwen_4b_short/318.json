Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "codeine crazy is one of my favorite future songs üôåüèΩ".

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The term "codeine" is a drug, but I should consider the context. Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance, so it's classified as an illicit drug. However, the phrase "codeine crazy" might be a metaphor or a song title. The user is referring to a song, so maybe it's not about using the drug. But the label rules include slang for drugs. "Crazy" here might be part of the song title, not a slang term. Wait, "codeine crazy" could be a play on words. "Crazy" might be a slang term for being high on codeine? Or is it just a song title? The user is saying it's a favorite future song, so it's more likely a reference to the song's title rather than actual drug use. However, the presence of "codeine" might still be a red flag. But according to the rules, if it's a slang term for drugs, then it's T. But if it's just a song title, then maybe F. The key is whether the text shows drug use. Since the user is talking about a song, not using or seeking codeine, maybe it's F. But codeine is a drug, so if the song is about using it, but the post doesn't mention using. The label rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention using codeine, just referring to a song. So maybe F. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, "codeine crazy" could be a slang term. But I think in this case, it's more likely a song title, so F.
