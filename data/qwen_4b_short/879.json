Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "With the booking ID, go direct in nearby Kozhikode dealer and possible to purchase, otherwise choose to wait for Ola S1(99k++) with same feature but less cost." 

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words are "dealer" and "purchase." The mention of a "dealer" could be a red flag. But wait, "dealer" can sometimes refer to a salesperson or someone who sells products, not necessarily drugs. However, in the context of drug abuse moderation, "dealer" might be slang for someone involved in drug trafficking. Also, the phrase "possible to purchase" suggests buying something. 

But wait, the post is talking about a "dealer" in Kozhikode. Kozhikode is a city in India. The mention of a dealer here might be referring to a person who sells drugs. The phrase "possible to purchase" could be indicating that the person is suggesting buying drugs from a dealer. 

However, I need to be careful. The term "dealer" can be ambiguous. In some contexts, it might not be related to drugs. But given the context of drug abuse moderation, any mention of buying or selling from a dealer would be a T. Also, the mention of "purchase" directly relates to buying, which is part of the T category. 

Additionally, the post is in a context where someone is advising to go to a dealer to purchase something, which is likely drugs. The Ola S1 is a car model, so that part is probably unrelated. The main focus is on the dealer and purchasing, which points towards drug-related activity. 

Therefore, the label should be T because the post is about purchasing from a dealer, which is associated with drug use or trafficking.
