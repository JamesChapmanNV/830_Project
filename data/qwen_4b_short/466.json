Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Hit her with no condom had to make her eat a plan b and im sippin on the codeine not brandy".

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let's break down the sentence.

The first part: "Hit her with no condom had to make her eat a plan b". Plan B here is probably emergency contraception, which is a medical term, not a drug. But the next part is "im sippin on the codeine not brandy". "Codeine" is a drug, specifically an opioid, which is classified as an illicit or abusive drug. The user is saying they're drinking codeine, which is a controlled substance. Also, "sippin" is slang for drinking. So that part clearly indicates drug use. 

Even though "plan B" is a medical term, the presence of codeine, which is a drug, makes the label T. The other parts don't mention drug use, but the codeine part is enough. So the answer should be T.
