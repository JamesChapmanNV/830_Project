Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "So #DMX took the injection and the #media said it was an overdose."

First, I need to understand what the rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key part is "#DMX took the injection". DMX is a rapper known for his drug-related controversies. The term "injection" here might refer to drug use. But wait, the media said it was an overdose. Overdose can be a result of drug use, but the post itself is about DMX taking an injection, which could be slang for using drugs. However, I need to check if "injection" here is a slang term for a drug. In some contexts, "injection" could be a medical term, but in slang, it might refer to using drugs. However, the mention of overdose by the media might indicate that it's a real incident, but the post is reporting on that. 

But the label is based on whether the text shows drug use. The post mentions DMX taking an injection, which could be a drug use. However, the media's statement is about an overdose. The user is asking if the text itself shows drug use. The post is stating that DMX took an injection, which might be a drug. But is "injection" a slang term here? Or is it a medical term? If it's a slang term, then it's T. If it's a literal injection, maybe not. But given that DMX is associated with drug use, the context might imply that the injection is related to drugs. Also, the media saying it was an overdose suggests that the injection was a drug, leading to an overdose. So the text is about DMX using a drug (injection) which led to an overdose. Therefore, the label would be T because it's showing drug use (injection) and the consequence (overdose). But wait, the media's statement is about the overdose, but the post is about DMX taking the injection. The key is whether the text itself shows drug use. The term "injection" might be a drug use, so T. Alternatively, if "injection" is a medical term, but in this context, given the mention of DMX and media, it's likely referring to drug use. So the answer is T.
