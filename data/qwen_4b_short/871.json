Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about Loona's demise being premature because of a new job posting, mentioning that their parent company is an arms dealer and military tech firm, implying they should have lots of money.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for terms like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about a company's parent being an arms dealer, which is related to military tech, but there's no mention of drugs. The mention of "money" is part of the context about the company's financial status, not related to drug use. The user is discussing a company's background and financial situation, not drug-related activities. Therefore, there's no indication of drug use here. The label should be F because it's about a company's parent company and financial aspects, not drug-related content.
