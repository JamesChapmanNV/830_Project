Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Snakes start hissing heads go missing rest in piss to the ones im killing chief keef drilling codeine spilling üêç‚öî‚ö∞‚ò†üíä".

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Let's break it down.

The words "codeine" is definitely a drug. Then there's "chief keef" which might be a reference to Chief Keef, a rapper known for his music, but I'm not sure if that's a slang term here. However, "drilling codeine" could be a slang term. "Drilling" in some contexts can mean using a drug, like "drilling" as in using a needle, but I'm not certain. Also, there's "spilling" which might be a slang term for using drugs, like "spill" as in "spill the beans" but not sure. The emojis include a snake, a sword, a skull, and a pill. The pill emoji is definitely related to medication or drugs. The snake and skull might be symbols related to drug use or death. 

But wait, the main drugs mentioned are codeine. Codeine is an opioid, so that's a clear T. The other parts like "chief keef" might be a reference to a person or a song, but if "drilling codeine" is a slang term, then that's T. The emojis also support the drug theme. So even if some parts are ambiguous, the presence of codeine and the pill emoji makes it T. The rest of the text might be metaphorical or unrelated, but the key is that codeine is a drug. So the label should be T.
