Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about someone who had surgery and was given Norco because they were allergic to Morphine. They mention getting the prescription at CVS Pharmacy at Target on the Katy Freeway.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post talks about the person having surgery, pain, and being given Norco. Norco is a brand name for oxycodone, which is a controlled substance used for pain management. The key here is whether the post is indicating drug use or abuse. The person was prescribed Norco because they were allergic to Morphine, which is a medical reason. They mention getting a prescription from a pharmacy, which is part of a medical treatment. There's no mention of using the drug recreationally, selling it, or any slang terms. The focus is on medical treatment and a prescription. So this would fall under F because it's a medical discussion about a prescribed medication. The fact that Norco is a controlled substance doesn't automatically make it a T; the context here is medical use, not abuse or illicit use. Therefore, the label should be F.
