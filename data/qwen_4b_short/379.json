Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "The stabbing was the cause of death. The motive was he was a drug dealer who hid narcotics in fake books and he got found out."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key part is "he was a drug dealer who hid narcotics in fake books." The term "drug dealer" directly relates to selling drugs, which is part of the T category. Also, "narcotics" is a slang term for illicit drugs. The fact that he was hiding them in fake books suggests trafficking or smuggling drugs. The motive being the stabbing is because he was caught, which ties into the illegal activity of dealing with drugs.

So, the post is discussing someone who is a drug dealer involved in trafficking narcotics. This clearly falls under T because it's about drug dealing and trafficking. The other parts about the stabbing being the cause of death are just the context, but the main point is the drug-related activity. Therefore, the label should be T.
