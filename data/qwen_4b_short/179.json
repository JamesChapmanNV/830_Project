Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The user is asking me to determine if the given social media post falls under T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). 

First, I need to read the post carefully. The user mentions George Floyd and his death, referencing a drug overdose. They say that someone who thinks he died of a drug overdose hasn't seen someone on opioids during an overdose. Then they say being high while being murdered by a cop doesn't make one less murdered. The last part is about needing to get off the internet with some emojis.

So, the key parts here are the discussion about George Floyd's death related to opioids. The post is talking about the cause of death and the context of being high during his murder. The mention of opioids is a drug, so that's a key point. The user is discussing drug use in the context of a death, which could be considered T. 

But wait, the label rules say T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post is not explicitly stating that someone is using drugs, but rather discussing the circumstances of a death related to opioids. However, the mention of opioids is a drug, and the context is about drug use leading to overdose. 

The user also says "lucky you" in response to someone who thinks he died of an overdose. That's a bit of a harsh comment, but the main point is the discussion about drug use. The last part about needing to get off the internet is a personal statement, not directly related to drug use. 

So, the main elements here are the discussion about opioids and overdose, which are related to drug use. Therefore, this would fall under T. The other parts are more about the reaction to the situation, but the core of the post is discussing drug-related causes of death. 

I think the correct label here is T.
