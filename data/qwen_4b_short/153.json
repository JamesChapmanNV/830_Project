Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Denver's first "equity" cannabis store went to a white guy from Wyoming Lol".

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "cannabis store" and "equity". The word "equity" in this context might refer to a policy or initiative aimed at promoting fairness in cannabis access, possibly in line with legalization efforts. The mention of a "cannabis store" is relevant because cannabis is a controlled substance in many places, but the label rules specify that T is for drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. 

The post doesn't mention any actual drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. It's talking about a store that's supposed to be equitable, which is a policy or social issue. The mention of a white guy from Wyoming is just a comment on who the store was opened to, which is a social commentary but not related to drug use. The "Lol" at the end is just an expression of humor or surprise. 

So, there's no direct reference to drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. The focus is on the store's equity initiative, which is a policy discussion. Therefore, the correct label should be F.
