Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "To the women I am mutuals with I want you to know that you are echelons above these men. Don't ever forget that. They are truly beneath you. Know that and know peace lolðŸ’ž"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, the main content is about gender dynamics, comparing women to men in a hierarchical way. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or related terms. Words like "echelons," "above," "beneath," "peace" are used, but none relate to drugs. The emojis (lol, ðŸ’ž) are just expressions and don't indicate drug-related content.

So, there's no indication of drug use or related activities here. The post is about social hierarchy and encouragement to maintain that stance. Therefore, it doesn't fit the T category. The correct label should be F.
