Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "YouTube - opiate withdrawal help, addiction: the actiq diaries vol...". The rules are T if it's about drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang), otherwise F.

First, I need to parse the content. The post mentions "opiate withdrawal help" and "addiction: the actiq diaries vol...". "Opiate withdrawal" is definitely related to drug use, specifically opioids. "Addiction" is a key term here. The title might be referring to a YouTube series about someone's experience with addiction, possibly related to opiates. The term "Actiq Diaries" is a real series that documents someone's struggle with addiction, including opiate withdrawal. 

So, the post is talking about help with opiate withdrawal and addiction, which are directly related to drug abuse. The mention of "opiate withdrawal" is a clear indicator of drug use. Even though it's about help and recovery, the content is still about drug use. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled T.
