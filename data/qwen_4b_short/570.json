Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "got a cute lil pendant necklace i can store 2 pills of morphine inside sick". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key part is "store 2 pills of morphine inside". Morphine is a controlled substance, specifically a powerful opioid, which is classified as an illicit drug in many contexts. The act of storing pills, especially a controlled substance like morphine, could indicate involvement in drug use or distribution. The mention of "sick" at the end might be a slang term, but in this context, it's probably just expressing a humorous or sarcastic tone. However, the main focus here is the storage of morphine pills.

Now, considering the rules, storing pills of morphine would be related to drug use or trafficking. Even if the person is just talking about having a pendant to store pills, it's still a direct reference to the use or possession of an illicit drug. The term "sick" might be a slang term, but in this case, the main point is the storage of morphine, which is a controlled substance. Therefore, this should be labeled as T because it's showing the use or possession of an illicit drug. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that would make this F. The post isn't discussing medical use, policy, news, or discouraging use. It's about having a pendant to store pills, which is directly related to drug use. So the correct label is T.
