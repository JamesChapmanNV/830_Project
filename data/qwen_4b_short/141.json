Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post includes hashtags like #crack, #crackhead, and mentions "vibe with us" along with gaming-related tags. The rules say T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. The hashtags #crack and #crackhead are direct references to drug use. Even though the main content is about gaming, the presence of those specific drug-related terms would trigger the T label. So the answer should be T.
