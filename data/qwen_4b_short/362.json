Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The rules state that T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post: The user starts with a question about someone messing up more than Biden, then asks if it's due to heavy drug use, listing specific drugs like heroin, opioids, fentanyl, crack. They also mention the person looking too young and share a personal story about losing brothers to drugs, ending with a plea for help.

First, I need to check if the post contains any direct references to drug use. The user is asking about the "drug of choice" and specifically names several illicit drugs. That's a direct mention of drug use. Also, the mention of losing brothers to drugs is a reference to drug abuse. The plea for help is a common response to drug-related issues. 

However, I need to make sure that the post isn't just a metaphor or a general discussion. The specific drugs listed are all illicit, and the context is about someone's drug use leading to messed-up behavior. The user is implying that the person's drug use is the cause. 

The rules include "slang for drugs" as part of T. The question is phrased in a way that's directly asking about the drug use, so it's not a metaphor. The mention of losing brothers to drugs is a factual statement about drug abuse. 

Therefore, the post clearly falls under T because it discusses drug use, mentions specific drugs, and refers to the consequences of drug abuse. The answer should be T.
