Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "U one of them niggas that don't believe shit he died from overdose". 

First, I need to check if this text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "overdose". Overdose is directly related to drug use, specifically. The person died from an overdose, which is a clear indication of drug abuse. 

But wait, the post also has some slang or offensive language. The user mentioned that T includes slang for drugs. However, the main point here is the mention of overdose. Even if the rest of the language is derogatory, the fact that it's talking about someone dying from an overdose would still fall under T. 

The rules say T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The term "overdose" is a direct indicator of drug use. The rest of the sentence is about the person not believing in something, but the key part is the overdose. 

So even though the post is offensive, the content that's relevant here is the mention of overdose, which is T. Therefore, the label should be T.
