Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a book by Mark Lanegan that's 300+ pages long, detailing him scoring heroin or crack, and mentions that it doesn't cover the Bubblegum-era. The user also says it's tragic and not recommended for those who view him fondly.

First, I need to check if the post contains any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "scoring heroin or crack." Scoring drugs is a slang term for cutting or preparing drugs for sale, which is definitely related to drug abuse. The mention of heroin and crack are specific illicit drugs. 

The post also refers to the book's content, which is about the author's drug use. The user is discussing the content of the book, which includes drug use. Even though the post is a review of the book, the content of the book itself involves drug use. The rules state that if the text shows drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang), it's labeled T. 

The other parts of the post, like the book's length, the mention of music, and the recommendation, don't relate to drug use. However, the core of the post is about the book's content, which includes drug use. So even though the post is a review, the content of the book is about drug use, so the text in the post is discussing that. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled T.

I need to make sure there's no other context that might make it F. The post is not about medical discussion or policy. It's a personal opinion on the book's content, which includes drug use. So the answer is T.
