Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post mentions "Buddy was jammin through the crowd. That's the seal dealer." So first, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang.

"Jammin" could be slang for jamming, which might relate to music, but in this context, it's followed by "seal dealer." Wait, "seal dealer" â€“ that's a slang term for a drug dealer, specifically dealing in drugs. The term "seal" here is likely a slang for a drug, maybe a reference to a specific drug like methamphetamine, which is sometimes called "seal" in some contexts. So "seal dealer" would mean someone selling drugs. 

The user is talking about seeing someone (Buddy) who is a seal dealer. That's directly related to drug trafficking or selling. So according to the rules, that's a T. The rest of the post is about finding a shirt, which is unrelated. The mention of "jammin through the crowd" might be a metaphor or part of a song, but the key part here is "seal dealer," which clearly points to drug-related activity. Therefore, the label should be T.
