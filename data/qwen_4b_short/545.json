Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Crack is one hell of a drug my G". The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to analyze the post. The key words here are "Crack" and "one hell of a drug". "Crack" is a slang term for a form of cocaine, which is an illicit drug. The phrase "one hell of a drug" is a strong expression, likely emphasizing the negative effects or the severity of the drug. The user is using "my G" which might be a typo or a casual way to address someone, but the main focus is on the drug.

Now, checking the label rules. The post mentions the drug "Crack" directly, which is a slang term for cocaine. The phrase "one hell of a drug" is a strong statement about the drug, indicating that the user is talking about the drug's effects. Since the post is discussing the drug itself, it falls under T. There's no mention of medical advice, policy, news, or metaphorical use. The user is likely expressing a negative opinion about the drug, which is part of the T category because it's discussing the drug's use or its impact.

I need to make sure there's no other interpretation. "My G" could be a typo for "my guy" or another slang, but the main content is about the drug. So the label should be T.
