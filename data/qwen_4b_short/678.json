Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Fentanyl is a prescription drug under the brands Actiq, Duragesic, and Sublimaze."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for all other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, it's stating that fentanyl is a prescription drug with specific brand names. The mention of brands like Actiq, Duragesic, and Sublimaze are all prescription medications that contain fentanyl. The statement is factual and informative, explaining that fentanyl is a prescription drug. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang. It's just providing information about the drug's classification and available brands.

So, since the post is a factual statement about fentanyl being a prescription drug without any indication of illicit use or related activities, it should be labeled as F. There's no use or mention of abuse, so it doesn't fit the T category. It's a medical or policy discussion, which falls under F.
