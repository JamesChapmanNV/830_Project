Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "That he scored more coke from his dealer."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: "scored more coke from his dealer." The key terms here are "scored" and "coke." "Coke" is a slang term for cocaine, which is an illicit drug. "Scored" in this context likely means obtained or acquired, so it's about getting the drug from a dealer. The phrase "from his dealer" indicates buying or obtaining the drug. 

So, the post is talking about someone getting more cocaine from a dealer, which directly relates to drug use and buying. According to the rules, this would be labeled T. There's no mention of medical use, policy, news, or metaphor here. It's clearly about drug acquisition, which falls under T.
