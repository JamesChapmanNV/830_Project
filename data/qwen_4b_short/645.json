Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "i'll send you some british ones like black tar heroin". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "send you some british ones like black tar heroin". The phrase "black tar heroin" is a direct slang term for heroin, which is an illicit drug. The mention of sending someone this substance implies involvement in drug trafficking or distribution, which falls under the T category. 

Additionally, the use of "black tar heroin" is a specific term associated with drug use. Even though the sentence is a bit ambiguous in context, the presence of the drug name and the action of sending it suggests illicit drug activity. There's no indication of medical discussion or a metaphor here. 

So, based on the rules, this should be labeled T because it's directly related to drug use and trafficking.
