Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on the given rules. The post is about the lack of affordable treatment and punitive policies leading to severe illness, job loss, and racial disparities. It also mentions overdose deaths being at their highest ever and the pandemic exacerbating treatment shortages, with the hashtag #WellnessWed.

First, I need to check if the post contains any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, such as using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key here is to look for explicit mentions of drug-related activities or slang.

Looking at the post: "A3: Lack of affordable treatment + punitive policies result in severe illness, job loss, and racial disparities in outcomes. Overdose deaths are at their highest ever + the pandemic is exacerbating treatment shortages #WellnessWed"

The terms here are "lack of affordable treatment," "overdose deaths," "treatment shortages." There's no mention of specific drugs, slang, or direct references to using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. The focus is on the consequences of policies and treatment availability, not on the act of using drugs. The hashtag #WellnessWed might be a reference to promoting wellness, but that's not directly related to drug use.

So, according to the rules, T is for text showing drug use, and F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, or discouraging use. This post is discussing the effects of policies on drug-related issues, not the actual use of drugs. It's more about the systemic issues leading to drug-related problems, not the use itself. Therefore, it should be labeled F.
