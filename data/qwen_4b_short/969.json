Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Ion Even Po Codeine, Got To Saddity Fa Da Lean." 

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. The words "Codeine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. The phrase "Got To Saddity Fa Da Lean" is a bit unclear, but "Saddity" might be a misspelling or slang. "Fa Da Lean" could be "for the lean," which might refer to something related to drug use, like "lean" being slang for a drug (like methamphetamine, which is sometimes called "lean"). 

So the post mentions Codeine, which is an illicit drug. Even though the rest of the phrase is unclear, the mention of Codeine alone is enough to trigger the T label. The user's rules state that any text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including slang, should be labeled T. 

I should check if there's any other part that might be a metaphor or not related. But "Codeine" is a direct reference to a drug. The rest might be slang or misspelled, but since the main term is a drug, it's T. The answer should be T.
