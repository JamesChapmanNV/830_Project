Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "birds in the trap sing brian mcknight, percocet and codeine please don't take my life". 

First, I need to check if the text mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let's break down the post.

The first part is "birds in the trap sing brian mcknight". "Birds in the trap" might be a metaphor or a song reference. "Brian McKnight" is a musician, so maybe that's a song title. Then "percocet and codeine" are both prescription drugs. Percocet is a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen, which is a controlled substance. Codeine is also a controlled substance, often used in medications. 

The last part is "please don't take my life", which seems like a plea, but not directly related to drug use. However, the mention of percocet and codeine are definitely drugs. The user might be referring to using these drugs, possibly in a context of addiction or seeking help. 

So, according to the rules, any mention of drugs (slang or names) would be T. The presence of "percocet" and "codeine" are direct references to drugs, so that's a T. The rest of the text might be metaphorical, but the drugs are explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the label should be T.
