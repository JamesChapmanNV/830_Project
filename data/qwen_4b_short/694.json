Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "She definitely a cool ass retired drug dealer ðŸ˜‚".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key part is "retired drug dealer". The term "drug dealer" directly refers to someone involved in selling drugs, which is trafficking. Even though the person is retired, the fact that they were a drug dealer indicates involvement in drug trafficking. The slang here is "cool ass", which is a colloquial expression, but the main term is "drug dealer".

So, according to the rules, since it mentions being a drug dealer, which is trafficking, the label should be T. The other parts like "cool ass" are just descriptors and don't relate to drug use. The emoji is just an expression, not relevant to the label. Therefore, the correct label is T.
