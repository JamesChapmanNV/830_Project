Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Rubix cubes were invented to give Xers something to do when the heroin kicked in."

First, I need to understand what the rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

So the post mentions "Xers" and "heroin." I need to figure out what "Xers" refers to. Wait, "Xers" might be a slang term. I recall that "X" is a slang term for marijuana, so "Xers" would be people who use marijuana. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, "Xers" could be a typo or a different slang. But given the context, it's likely referring to drug users.

Then the mention of heroin. Heroin is definitely an illicit drug. The sentence suggests that Rubik's cubes were invented to keep people (Xers) occupied when heroin's effects kick in. This implies that the users are using heroin and need something to do while under its influence. That's a direct reference to drug use, specifically heroin, and the slang term "Xers" for marijuana users. However, the combination of heroin and Xers might be a bit confusing. Wait, but "Xers" could be a typo for "Xers" as in users of a drug, but if "X" is marijuana, then it's a mix of two drugs. But the main point is that the post is talking about drug use, specifically heroin and possibly marijuana. 

The key here is whether the post is showing illicit or abusive drug use. The sentence is stating that Rubik's cubes were invented for people using drugs (heroin and Xers) to do something when the drug's effects kick in. This is a direct reference to drug use, so it would fall under T. 

But wait, is "Xers" a slang term for a specific drug? If "X" is a slang for a drug, then yes. For example, "X" is sometimes used as a slang for marijuana, but in some contexts, it could be other drugs. However, the mention of heroin is clear. The post is about people using heroin and possibly other drugs (Xers), so the presence of heroin alone is enough to label this as T. 

Alternatively, if "Xers" is not a recognized slang term, maybe it's a typo. But given the context, the user is probably referring to drug use. The sentence is making a metaphor or a statement about drug users needing something to do when under the influence. However, the rules include metaphor as F, but if the text is directly referring to drug use, then it's T. 

Wait, the rules say T includes slang for drugs. So if "Xers" is a slang term for drug users, then that's part of T. Even if it's a metaphor, if it's using slang for drugs, then it's T. But the sentence is stating that Rubik's cubes were invented for people using drugs (heroin and Xers) to do something when the drug kicks in. That's a direct reference to drug use, so it's T. 

Therefore, the label should be T.
