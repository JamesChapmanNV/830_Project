Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I'll let you know soon. I prob won't crack it open for a few days or a week. We have guests arriving on the 8th! :D"

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user says "I prob won't crack it open for a few days or a week." The phrase "crack it open" might be a slang term. Wait, "crack" can mean to open something, but in drug slang, "crack" refers to a drug (crack cocaine). However, the context here is about opening something, maybe a container or a package. But the user is talking about not opening it for a few days. The "prob" is probably "probably" (slang for probably). 

But is "crack it open" a slang term for drug use? I'm not sure. If "crack" is referring to the drug, then "crack it open" might be a metaphor. Alternatively, maybe the person is talking about opening a container, like a bottle or something. But without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the key here is whether the post shows drug use. The rest of the message is about guests arriving, so it's probably not related to drugs. 

The phrase "crack it open" could be a metaphor, but if it's slang for drug use, then it would be T. But I need to check if "crack" in this context is a drug slang. In some contexts, "crack" is a drug, but "crack it open" might be more about opening something. Alternatively, maybe the person is referring to opening a container of a drug, but that's not clear. 

Since the rest of the message doesn't mention drugs, and the only possible clue is "crack it open," which could be a metaphor or a slang term. However, without more context, it's safer to assume that it's not directly related to drug use. The user is talking about not opening something for a few days, perhaps a container. So maybe it's F. 

But wait, if "crack it open" is a slang for using drugs, then it would be T. However, I'm not certain. In some contexts, "crack" can be a slang for drug use, but "crack it open" might not be. Alternatively, maybe the person is talking about opening a container, like a pill bottle. But the user is not mentioning drugs, so maybe it's F. 

Alternatively, maybe "crack it open" is a metaphor for something else. The user is probably talking about not opening a container (like a package) for a few days. So the label would be F. 

Therefore, the answer is F.
