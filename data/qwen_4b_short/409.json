Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "If playing football was drugs i would hv been taking overdose üò≠üôèüíî God knows". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "drugs", "overdose", and the context of comparing playing football to drugs. The user says if playing football was drugs, they would have taken an overdose. 

The rule says T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The phrase "taking overdose" directly relates to drug use. Even though it's a metaphor (comparing football to drugs), the actual mention of overdose is a strong indicator of T. 

But wait, the user might be using a metaphor. However, the rules include metaphor as F. Wait, no: the rules say F is for all other cases except when it's T. The label rules state T is when there's drug use, and F otherwise. The metaphor here is the comparison, but the actual use of "overdose" is a direct reference to drug use. So even if it's a metaphor, the presence of the word "overdose" would still make it T. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is joking or using hyperbole. But according to the rules, if the text shows drug use, it's T. The mention of overdose is a clear indicator. Therefore, the label should be T.
