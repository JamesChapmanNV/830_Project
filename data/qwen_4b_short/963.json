Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Ever seen a nigga keep it real then he change up". 

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "nigga" and "keep it real". "Nigga" is a slang term, often used in African American Vernacular English, and it can be considered offensive or part of a cultural context. However, the main question is whether this post relates to drug use. 

The phrase "keep it real" is a common expression, often used in rap or hip-hop culture to mean being genuine or authentic. The second part, "then he change up", might be referring to someone changing their behavior or appearance. There's no direct mention of drugs here. 

I need to check if "keep it real" is a slang for drugs. From what I know, "keep it real" isn't a slang term for drug use. It's more about being honest or authentic. The word "nigga" is not related to drugs. The post seems to be about someone's behavior or appearance, not drug use. 

So, based on the rules, since there's no mention of drugs, using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or drug slang, the label should be F. The post is more of a metaphor or a cultural reference rather than discussing drug abuse. Therefore, the answer is F.
