Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "He can't open them. He's got a serious drug problem. We'll be hearing about his death from overdose at some point."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let's break down the post.

The first part: "He can't open them." Not sure what "them" refers to, but maybe it's a metaphor or unrelated. The second part: "He's got a serious drug problem." That's a direct mention of a drug problem, which is T. The third part: "We'll be hearing about his death from overdose at some point." Overdose is a direct mention of drug-related death. 

So the key points here are "serious drug problem" and "overdose." Both are related to drug abuse. Even though the first part is unclear, the rest clearly indicates drug use. The label should be T because it's discussing drug use and overdose, which are part of the T category. The other cases are F, but here it's definitely T.
