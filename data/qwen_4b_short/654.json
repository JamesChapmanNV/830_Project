Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "we need racial justice. Support healing for Black communities and provide funding from cannabis tax revenue towards our communities for healing justice". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main points are about racial justice, healing Black communities, and using cannabis tax revenue. The mention of cannabis tax revenue might be relevant. But does that relate to drug use? Cannabis is a drug, but here it's being discussed in terms of tax revenue. The post is about using that revenue for healing justice, which seems more like a policy or social issue rather than direct drug use. 

The key here is whether the post is about drug use itself or using drug-related topics in a policy context. The term "cannabis tax revenue" is part of a policy discussion. The post is advocating for funding from cannabis taxes to support communities, which is a policy or medical discussion, not directly about using or seeking drugs. There's no mention of using, selling, or trafficking. The term "healing justice" might be a metaphor or a policy initiative, not direct drug use.

So, the label should be F because it's discussing policy and funding related to cannabis taxes for social justice, not directly about drug use. The presence of "cannabis" is part of the policy context, not the illicit use. Therefore, the correct label is F.
