Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "Or it's george floyd, and his dealer is hereðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜†". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang), otherwise F.

First, I need to parse the sentence. The mention of George Floyd is a reference to the real-life event where he died after being killed by police, which is a significant social justice issue. The phrase "his dealer is here" suggests that someone involved in drug dealing is present. But wait, is this a literal statement or a metaphor?

The user is moderating social media posts, so I need to check if the post is directly referring to drug use or trafficking. The term "dealer" here could imply someone selling drugs. However, the context might be a metaphor or a reference to a situation where a dealer is present, perhaps in a different context, like a metaphorical or symbolic meaning. But given that George Floyd's case was related to police brutality, not drug use, maybe the mention of a dealer is part of a metaphor or a reference to a different context.

But the problem is whether the post is showing illicit drug use. The phrase "dealer is here" could be referring to someone selling drugs, which would be T. However, if it's a metaphor, like in a song or a reference to a different context, maybe not. But the presence of "dealer" in the context of George Floyd's case might be a reference to the real-life situation where he was involved with drugs, but that's not clear. Alternatively, it could be a metaphor for something else.

Wait, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so the key is whether the post is directly showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The mention of "dealer" is a term associated with selling drugs. So even if it's a metaphor, if the post is using the term "dealer" in the context of drug trafficking, then it's T. However, if it's a metaphor for something else, like a person in a different role, then maybe not. But in the absence of more context, "dealer" is a term that's associated with drug selling. Therefore, the post is referring to a dealer, which is part of drug trafficking. So the label should be T.
