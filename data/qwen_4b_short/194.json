Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Real talk I'm PISSED because as a Broke using medical cannabis I relish the sales at dispensaries ðŸ˜­ (and they can't deliver in NH)".

First, I need to check if this post falls under the T category, which includes text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, such as using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The F category is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post: The person mentions "using medical cannabis". Medical cannabis is a legitimate medical use, so that's a bit tricky. However, the user is "Broke using medical cannabis" which might indicate they are using it for medical purposes. The phrase "relish the sales at dispensaries" could imply they are purchasing from dispensaries, which are legal in some places for medical use. The mention of "they can't deliver in NH" refers to a location (New Hampshire) where maybe medical cannabis delivery is restricted.

But the key here is whether the post is about illicit drug use. Since it's specified as "medical cannabis", which is legal in some states for medical purposes, the use here is for medical reasons. However, the user is also mentioning being "PISSED" about not being able to get delivery, which might be a frustration with the system, but not necessarily about drug use itself. The main points are about using medical cannabis and the challenges with dispensaries. There's no mention of illicit drug use, slang, or activities like selling or trafficking. The post is more about the personal experience with medical cannabis and the issues with access. Therefore, this should be labeled F because it's a medical discussion, even though it's about cannabis, which is a controlled substance. The key is that it's for medical use, not illicit. So the answer is F.
