Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "#ICYMI: Great Neck man sentenced to prison after providing heroin in two overdose deaths in Queens: DA"

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "heroin" and "overdose deaths." Heroin is definitely an illicit drug. The man is sentenced for providing heroin, which is directly related to drug use. The mention of overdose deaths indicates that the heroin was involved in fatal cases. 

The label rules say T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Here, the post is about someone being sentenced for providing heroin, which is selling or trafficking. The overdose deaths are a consequence of the drug use. So this clearly falls under T. 

The other option is F, which includes medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. This post is news about a legal case involving drug trafficking, so it's not F. Therefore, the correct label should be T.
