Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking how high someone needs to be to fall asleep while smoking crack. First, I need to determine if this post falls under the T or F category.

The label rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post mentions "smoking crack," which is a slang term for crack cocaine, an illicit drug. The question is about the effects of the drug, specifically the high needed to fall asleep. 

Even though the question is about the effects, the mention of crack cocaine is a direct reference to an illicit drug. The user is asking about the drug's impact, which relates to its use. The question isn't about medical advice or policy, but rather about the experience of using the drug. So, according to the rules, this would be labeled T because it's discussing the use of an illicit drug. The answer should be T.
