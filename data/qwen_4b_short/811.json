Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Mix the codeine with the sprite and i pop me a xan bitch, i'm getting to the money i ain't changing my plan". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, "codeine" is a controlled substance, so that's definitely a drug. Then there's "xan bitch". Wait, "xan" could be a slang term. Let me think. Xan is sometimes slang for Xanax, which is a benzodiazepine, another controlled drug. So "xan" here is likely referring to Xanax. 

Then the phrase "pop me a xan" might mean taking a dose of Xanax. The user is mixing codeine with sprite, which is a drink, and then taking Xanax. The mention of "getting to the money" might be about money, but the main point here is the drug use. 

The user is also saying they're not changing their plan, which might be related to their drug use. So the key elements here are codeine and Xanax, both are drugs. The actions mentioned are mixing codeine with a drink and taking Xanax. 

So according to the rules, any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs would be T. Here, the user is using codeine and Xanax, which are drugs. The slang "xan" is a reference to Xanax. Therefore, this post should be labeled T.
