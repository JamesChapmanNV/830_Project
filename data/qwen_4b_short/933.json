Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Comes with a bottle of heroin for a housewarming gift."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The key words here are "heroin" and "bottle." Heroin is a controlled substance and an illicit drug. The phrase "comes with a bottle of heroin" suggests that the item is heroin, which is clearly an illicit drug. The context is a housewarming gift, but the presence of heroin in a bottle directly indicates drug use. 

I should also consider if there's any metaphorical or non-literal use. However, "bottle of heroin" is a direct reference to the drug itself. There's no indication that it's a metaphor, like a "bottle of wine" being a metaphor for something else. The term "heroin" is a slang term for the drug, so that definitely falls under T.

Therefore, the correct label should be T.
