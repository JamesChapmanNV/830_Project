Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I stopped bleeding and then I fell because of the rain. Totally crack my waist and now I'm bleeding again."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person talks about stopping bleeding, falling in the rain, cracking their waist, and bleeding again. The key words here are "crack my waist" which might be a metaphor for a severe injury, like a fracture. But I need to check if there's any mention of drugs. The words "crack" could be slang, but in this context, it's more likely referring to a physical injury. There's no mention of drugs, drug-related terms, or any slang. The bleeding and falling are physical injuries, not related to drug use. The user might be describing a physical injury from falling, not drug use. So, there's no indication of drug use here. Therefore, the label should be F.
