Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "They say scrap NASS that provide checks for executive recklessness but give PMB special power, too much codeine is dangerous to reasoning".

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. The mention of "NASS" might be an acronym, but I'm not sure. However, the key part here is "too much codeine is dangerous to reasoning". Codeine is a drug, specifically an opioid, which is classified as an illicit or abusive drug. The phrase "too much codeine" directly refers to the use of codeine, which is a controlled substance. 

The rules state that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The phrase "too much codeine" clearly indicates the use of codeine, which is a drug. Even though the rest of the sentence talks about NASS and PMB, the key part here is the mention of codeine. 

So, the presence of codeine in the text, even if it's part of a longer sentence, should trigger the T label. The other parts of the sentence might be about political or institutional issues, but the mention of codeine is the critical factor here. 

I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. The term "codeine" is a drug, and the context is about its danger, which is a direct reference to its use. Therefore, the label should be T.
