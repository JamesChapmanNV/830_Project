Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "*** fans calling it karma like he himself wasn't an addict w a peddling gf/ dealer for the rich and famus ðŸ‘€ dramatic ass".

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. It mentions fans referring to someone as "karma" but implying that the person isn't an addict. Then there's "w a peddling gf/ dealer for the rich and famus". The key parts here are "addict" and "dealer for the rich and famous". 

The label rules state that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main terms are "addict" and "dealer". "Addict" directly refers to drug use, so that's a T. The mention of "dealer for the rich and famous" suggests someone involved in selling drugs, which is trafficking or selling, so that's also T. The rest of the text seems to be about fans' reactions and maybe some drama, but the key terms here are the drug-related ones. 

I need to check if there's any metaphorical use. The phrase "karma" might be a metaphor, but the context is about someone being an addict and a dealer. The mention of "peddling" (which means selling) and "dealer" clearly points to drug trafficking or selling. So even if "karma" is a metaphor, the other parts are about drug use and dealing. 

Therefore, the label should be T because the post mentions drug use (addict) and selling (dealer), which are covered under the T category.
