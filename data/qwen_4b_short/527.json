Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about partnering with someone to host an online discussion about an issue brief on the impact of the overdose crisis on the Latino community in California. The event is on April 21 at 3pm PST, and they mention registering here.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "overdose crisis" and "Latino Community in California." The topic is about the effects of an overdose crisis, which is related to drug abuse, but the post itself doesn't mention specific drugs, using, buying, selling, or any slang. It's more about discussing the impact of the crisis, which is a medical or policy discussion. The event is about raising awareness or discussing the issue, not promoting or discussing drug use. So according to the rules, T is for text that shows drug use, and F is for other cases like medical or policy discussions. Since the post is about discussing the impact of an overdose crisis, which is a medical or policy topic, the label should be F.
