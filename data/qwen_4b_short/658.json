Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about people trying drugs to get high, overdosing, and the struggle with addiction. The rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: The person mentions "take drugs to get High" which is directly referring to drug use. Then "break the barrier it happens a lot then they overdose" – that's talking about the consequences of drug use. Also, "drug addiction it's a big struggle" and "crave it & try to get high" – all of these are discussing the use of drugs, the effects, and the addiction. There's no mention of medical advice, policy, news, or metaphors. The language is straightforward about using drugs and the problems associated with it. So according to the rules, this should be labeled T because it's discussing drug use and its consequences. The answer should be T.
