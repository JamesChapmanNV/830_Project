Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a comic dealer in Glasgow with contact info and some hashtags.

First, I need to check if the text mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The post talks about a comic shop, which is a store selling comics. The hashtags include things like #Glasgow, #ScotlandLovesLocal, and #comics. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, selling drugs, or any slang related to drugs. The contact info is a phone number and social media handles, which doesn't relate to drugs. 

The rules say T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Since the post is about a comic dealer, it's related to comics, not drugs. The hashtags are about local businesses and comics. There's no indication of drug-related activities here. 

So, the answer should be F because it's all about a comic shop and doesn't involve any drug-related content. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden references or slang. But "comics" here is a noun referring to the store, not the comic books. The tags are about local businesses. No mention of drugs or related terms. Therefore, F is correct.
