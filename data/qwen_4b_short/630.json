Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a police officer attending a court case where someone was sentenced for cannabis factories. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang.

First, the main subject is Edison ADEMAJ being sentenced for two cannabis factories. The term "cannabis" is a drug, but the context here is about manufacturing and trafficking. The post mentions "cannabis factories," which implies production, so that's trafficking. The police officers are involved in the case, but the post doesn't mention any personal use or seeking. The quote from SGT WILLOUGHBY talks about the work of PCSO's, which is about law enforcement, not drug use. 

The rules say T if it's about drug use, trafficking, etc. Here, the focus is on the legal case related to cannabis manufacturing, which is trafficking. But the label is for the text itself. The post doesn't mention any personal use, but the fact that it's about cannabis factories (trafficking) might be considered. However, the user's instruction says T if the text shows drug use. The post is reporting on a legal case, not the individual's personal use. So, the answer might be F because it's a news report about a legal case, not the person using drugs. Wait, but the term "cannabis factories" is trafficking. But the label is about the text showing drug use. The post is about the legal case, not the person's use. So maybe F. The answer is F.
