Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Morphine is more powerful than single malt scotch ðŸ˜³".

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

So the post is comparing morphine to single malt scotch. Morphine is a powerful opioid, which is an illicit drug. But is the post indicating drug use? The sentence is a comparison, not directly stating that someone is using morphine. However, morphine is a drug used medically, but in the context of the post, it's being compared to a type of alcohol. The emoji is a face with tears, which might indicate some emotional reaction, but not necessarily drug use.

Wait, the key here is whether the text shows drug use. The post mentions morphine, which is a drug, but is it being used in a way that indicates abuse or illicit use? The sentence is a comparison, not a statement about using the drug. It's more of a metaphor or a humorous comparison. The user might be making a statement about the potency of morphine versus alcohol. Since the post doesn't explicitly mention using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking, but just comparing two things, it's more of a metaphor. Therefore, the label should be F. But wait, morphine is a controlled substance, so maybe the mention of it is considered a slang for drugs. However, the post doesn't indicate that the person is using it. It's just a comparison. So according to the rules, unless it's directly about using, seeking, etc., it's F. So the answer should be F.
