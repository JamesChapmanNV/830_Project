Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post mentions something about Halloween urban legends where people put drugs in sweets, specifically heroin gummy bears. The user is pointing out that making heroin gummy bears is a lot of hassle and not worth it.

First, I need to check if this post falls under the T category, which is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is whether the post is directly discussing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The post talks about the Halloween legend where people might put drugs in sweets. However, the user is actually pointing out that making heroin gummy bears is not practical. The main point here is that the post is discussing a myth or a rumor, not actually promoting or discussing the use of drugs. The mention of heroin is part of the legend, but the post is not endorsing or encouraging drug use. Instead, it's highlighting the impracticality of the idea. 

So, even though heroin is mentioned, the context is about a myth and the impracticality of making such gummy bears. There's no explicit mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. The post is more about debunking a myth rather than discussing drug use. Therefore, it doesn't fit the T category. The correct label would be F because it's not promoting or discussing drug use but rather addressing a myth.
