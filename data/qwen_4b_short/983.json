Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "She's gonna get her hooked on morphine now so she becomes dependant or sell her. It's bad". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "hooked on morphine" and "dependant". Morphine is a controlled substance, typically used medically but also associated with abuse. The phrase "get her hooked" suggests that someone is being made to use morphine, which could imply drug use. Also, "dependant" is a term related to addiction, which is a form of drug abuse.

The post also mentions "sell her", which might refer to selling drugs, but the main focus seems to be on the person becoming dependent. The phrase "It's bad" is a general statement, but the main content is about drug use leading to dependency. 

According to the label rules, T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, "morphine" is a drug, and the context implies that someone is being hooked on it, which is a form of drug use. The mention of dependency is a direct indicator of drug abuse. 

So, the label here should be T because the post discusses drug use (morphine) leading to dependency, which is a form of abuse. The other part about selling might be a bit ambiguous, but the main focus is on the drug use and dependency. Therefore, the correct label is T.
