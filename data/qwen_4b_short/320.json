Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "When a girl has Codeine snaps at night then snaps of her kids soccer game in the morning, it's like wtf.. Parenting 101 or..?ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚ #PoorKids"

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is the mention of "Codeine." Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug. The post says the girl "has Codeine snaps at night." Wait, "snaps" here might be a typo or slang. But in the context, "snaps" could refer to using the drug, maybe "snaps" as in taking the drug. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "snaps" as in photos, but the mention of Codeine is the key.

So the main point is that the person is using Codeine, which is an illicit drug. The rest of the post talks about parenting and the girl's behavior, but the presence of Codeine is the critical factor. The hashtag #PoorKids might be a reference to the situation, but the main issue here is the mention of Codeine. Therefore, according to the rules, if the text shows drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang), then it's T. Since Codeine is explicitly mentioned, even if the context is about parenting, the drug use is present. Therefore, the label should be T.
