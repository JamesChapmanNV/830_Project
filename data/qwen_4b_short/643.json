Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise.

Looking at the post: "Last name Savage bitch, but no I'm not Randy Hit her with no condom, had to make her eat a plan B And I'm sippin' on that Codeine,not Brandy"

First, I need to check for any mention of drugs. The key parts here are "Codeine" and "Brandy". Codeine is a controlled substance, an opiate, so that's definitely a drug. The mention of "Codeine" would trigger the T label. 

Then there's "plan B" which is a contraceptive, but the context here is that the person had to make her eat it, which might imply an emergency contraceptive. However, the main drug here is Codeine. 

Also, the phrase "sippin' on that Codeine" clearly indicates consumption of the drug. Even though "Brandy" is a type of alcohol, the contrast here is between Codeine (a drug) and Brandy (alcohol), but the key is the mention of Codeine. 

The other parts of the post involve a sexual encounter without a condom and using Plan B, which are health-related but not directly related to drug use. However, the presence of Codeine as a drug use is enough to label this as T. 

So, the answer should be T because Codeine is an illicit drug mentioned in the text.
