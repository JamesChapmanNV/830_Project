Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "hi yes I just woke up from a codeine nap to this compliment ty Robbie". The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to check if "codeine" is mentioned. Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance, so that's a key point. The phrase "codeine nap" might be a slang term. Wait, "codeine nap" could be a way of saying taking codeine to fall asleep, which is using the drug. But is that considered illicit or abusive? Codeine is a controlled substance, and using it without a prescription could be considered abuse. However, if someone is using it for medical purposes, like prescribed for pain, it's different. But the post doesn't mention a prescription. The user just says they took codeine to nap, which might be a form of misuse. 

But the label is T if it shows drug use. The term "codeine" itself is a drug. So even if it's for a nap, the act of using codeine could be considered T. However, the user might be using it for a medical reason, but the post doesn't specify. The key is whether the text shows illicit or abusive use. Since the post doesn't mention a prescription or medical context, it's more likely to be considered T. 

Alternatively, maybe "codeine nap" is a metaphor. But I don't think that's the case. Codeine is a drug, and taking it for a nap would be using it. So the label should be T. But wait, the user is just waking up from a codeine nap. The act of taking codeine for a nap is using the drug, which would be T. Therefore, the answer is T.
