Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F. The post is "New Music! Dwelly ft. Yung Spyda in "Codeine Chill"!". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug-related terms. The title of the song is "Codeine Chill". Codeine is a drug, right? It's an opioid, used in medications, but also classified as a controlled substance. So "Codeine" here is the name of the song. But does that count as showing drug use? The label rules mention slang for drugs. Codeine is a drug, but is it considered slang here? Or is it just the name of the song?

Wait, the song title might be using "Codeine" as part of the title, which could be a reference to the drug. But the question is whether the text shows drug use. The post itself doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. It's just a music release announcement. The song title includes "Codeine", which is a drug, but is that considered showing drug use? Or is it just the name of the song?

The label rules say "slang for drugs" would be T. Codeine is a drug, but is it slang? Or is it a proper noun here? For example, if the song was called "Cocaine Chill", that would be more obvious. But "Codeine" is a specific drug. However, in the context of a song title, it might be using the drug's name as part of the title, which could be considered as showing drug use. But the rules specify that T is when the text shows drug use, like using, seeking, buying, etc. So if the song title is "Codeine Chill", does that count as showing drug use? Or is it just a reference to the drug without indicating use?

This is a bit tricky. The key is whether the text is showing the act of using or referring to the drug in a way that implies use. The post is just announcing a song titled "Codeine Chill". The title might be a play on words, but unless it's explicitly mentioning using the drug, it might not be T. However, the presence of the drug's name in the title could be considered as showing the drug's name, which is part of the T category. But the rules specify "slang for drugs". Codeine is a drug, but is it slang? Or is it a proper noun here?

Alternatively, maybe the song title is using "Codeine" as part of the title, which could be considered as showing the drug's name, thus T. But I need to check the exact rules again. The rules state T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. So if the song title is "Codeine Chill", that's a reference to the drug, but is that considered showing use? Or is it just a name?

In this case, the post is just announcing the song, not stating that the song is about using codeine. The title is just a title. So maybe it's F, because it's not showing the act of using or seeking, but just the name of the song. Unless the title is using the drug's name as a metaphor or slang. But codeine is a real drug, so it's not slang. Therefore, the label might be F. But I'm not 100% sure. Wait, the user says "slang for drugs" is part of T. So if the text uses slang, like "dope", "acid", etc., then it's T. But codeine is a drug, not slang. So the title includes the drug's name, but not necessarily slang. So the answer might be F. But I'm not sure. Maybe the presence of the drug's name in the title is considered as showing drug use, hence T. But I think the correct answer here is F, because the post is just announcing a song, not indicating that the drug is being used. The title is just a title, not a reference to use. Therefore, the label is F.
