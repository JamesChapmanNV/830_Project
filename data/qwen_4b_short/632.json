Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says, "i need me a little morphine myself after that episodeâ€¦. #Euphoria #EuphoriaHBOMax". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use. The user mentions "morphine". Morphine is a controlled substance, typically used in medical settings for pain relief. However, in the context of the post, the person is saying they need a little morphine after an episode. The use of "morphine" here could be a reference to the show Euphoria, which is about drug use, but the actual mention of morphine is a real drug. 

But wait, the user is using "morphine" in a literal sense. The post is about needing morphine, which is a drug. However, the context is after an episode of the show. But the label rules are about whether the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if someone is talking about using morphine, that's T. However, if it's in the context of a show or metaphor, maybe it's F. But the user is directly mentioning morphine, which is a drug. 

But the post is from a user who is talking about needing morphine. So that's using the drug. However, the user might be referring to the show's content. But the actual text says "i need me a little morphine myself after that episode". The use of "morphine" is a real drug, so this would be T. Unless it's a metaphor. But the user is directly stating they need morphine, which is a drug. So the label should be T. But wait, the show Euphoria is about drug use, so maybe the user is referencing the show. However, the actual text is about needing morphine. So the answer is T because it's mentioning the use of morphine. Unless it's a metaphor, but the user is directly stating they need it. So the answer is T.
