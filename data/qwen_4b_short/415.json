Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking if the post should be labeled T or F. The post is: "Gah! I by coldy flu tabs as separate ingredients to avoid paracetamol. No chance of tramadol if straight codeine not available?"

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The person mentions buying cold flu tabs as separate ingredients to avoid paracetamol. They're also talking about tramadol and codeine. Now, I need to check if this involves illicit or abusive drug use.

Paracetamol is a common over-the-counter medication, so avoiding it might be a way to mix other substances. Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. Tramadol is another opioid. The user is talking about buying medications and using them in a way that might involve combining or altering them. 

But wait, the key here is whether this is about using illicit drugs. Paracetamol is legal, but codeine and tramadol are controlled substances. However, the user is discussing the possibility of using codeine and tramadol, which are prescription medications. But the post is about avoiding paracetamol and using codeine, which could be a way to self-medicate or misuse prescription drugs. 

The label T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The user is talking about using codeine and tramadol, which are controlled substances. If they're using them without a prescription or in a way that's considered abuse, that would be T. But the post doesn't explicitly state that they're using them illegally. It's more about their method of obtaining or using medications. 

However, the mention of "coldy flu tabs" might be a typo for "cold flu tabs" as in cold medications. If they're splitting the tabs to avoid paracetamol, that's a way to mix ingredients, which could be a form of misuse. But paracetamol is a common ingredient in cold meds. If they're avoiding it, maybe they're trying to get other ingredients like codeine. 

But the main point is whether this is about drug use. Since codeine and tramadol are controlled substances, and the user is discussing their use, even if they're not necessarily using them illicitly, the act of seeking or using them could be considered T. Alternatively, if it's just about using medications as prescribed, it might be F. 

But the user is talking about "no chance of tramadol if straight codeine not available," which might imply they're trying to get tramadol through codeine, which is a controlled substance. This could be a form of drug abuse or misuse, so the label would be T. 

Alternatively, if they're just discussing the availability and methods of obtaining medications, maybe it's F. But the key is the context of drug use. Since they're talking about using codeine and tramadol, which are drugs, even if they're prescription, the act of seeking or using them could be considered T. 

So, the answer is T.
