Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "It gets confusing which lie to believe. Make cannabis legal to help the suffering, but do nothing to accomplish. Been almost 2 years since failed elections promises."

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "cannabis legal" and "drug use." The user is talking about making cannabis legal, which is a policy discussion. However, the mention of "cannabis" could be a red flag. But wait, the rules specify that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. So, if the post is discussing cannabis in the context of legalization, is that considered drug use?

Wait, the rules say T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So, if the post is talking about making cannabis legal, that's a policy discussion, not necessarily using or seeking. But the term "cannabis" itself is a drug. However, the post is not about using it, but about legalizing it. The user is discussing the political aspect of legalization, not the actual use. 

But the second part says "do nothing to accomplish" which might be a metaphor. The mention of "failed elections promises" is about politics, not drug use. The main subject here is the discussion around legalizing cannabis as a policy, not the actual use or abuse. Therefore, the post is a policy discussion, which would fall under F. 

Wait, but the first part says "Make cannabis legal to help the suffering." The word "cannabis" is a drug. But the post is not about using it, but about legalizing it. The rules say T is when the text shows drug use, seeking, buying, etc. So if the post is discussing legalization, that's a policy discussion, not T. Unless the post is using "cannabis" as slang for something else, but in this case, it's clearly referring to cannabis. However, the context is about legalizing it, not using it. Therefore, the label should be F. 

But wait, the user is talking about "cannabis" in the context of legalizing it. The rules don't say that discussing legalization is T. The T is for when the text shows drug use, not the discussion about legalizing. So the answer is F.
