Okay, let's see. The user provided a social media post: "Put codeine on salad, guess I'm on a codeine salad." They want me to label this as T or F based on the rules given.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about putting codeine on a salad and saying they're on a codeine salad. Codeine is a controlled substance, an opioid, and is classified as an illicit drug. The phrase "codeine salad" is a slang or a metaphor for using codeine. But wait, is it a metaphor or actual drug use?

The key here is whether the post is indicating actual drug use. The person is saying they are "on a codeine salad," which sounds like they are consuming codeine in this context. The phrase "put codeine on salad" might be a way of saying they're taking codeine, perhaps in a non-literal way, but the intent here is to indicate that they are using codeine. 

Since codeine is an illicit drug and the post is using it in a way that suggests consumption, this would fall under T. Even if it's a metaphor, the use of the drug's name in a context that implies use would still be considered T. The label rules mention slang for drugs, so "codeine salad" could be a slang term here. Therefore, the correct label is T.
