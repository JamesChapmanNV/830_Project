Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about CBD oil from the cannabis plant and mentions that it doesn't contain THC, so it's safe and doesn't cause intoxication or problems with driving. The person also says that anything with THC is a no-no.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post here is talking about CBD oil, which is a compound from cannabis. The user is explaining that CBD doesn't have THC, so it's okay. They're also warning against THC-containing products. The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use or just providing information about CBD and THC.

The post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking drugs. It's more about explaining the difference between CBD and THC, and their effects. The user is giving information, not engaging in drug use or discussing illegal activities. The mention of THC being a no-no is more of a cautionary statement rather than promoting or discussing drug use. 

So, since there's no explicit mention of drug use, seeking, buying, etc., and it's more of an informative post about the differences between CBD and THC, the label should be F. The user is not promoting drug use but rather educating about the substances. Therefore, the correct label is F.
