Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Jumping Off Of A Mountain Into A Sea Of Codeine". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key part here is "Sea Of Codeine". Codeine is a drug, specifically an opioid. The phrase "Sea Of Codeine" is a metaphor, right? It's not literal. The user is using codeine as a metaphor to describe something else, maybe a lot of codeine, but not necessarily using it. The rest of the phrase "Jumping Off Of A Mountain Into A Sea Of Codeine" seems like a metaphor for a dramatic or intense action, perhaps in a creative or literary context. 

But wait, is "Sea Of Codeine" a slang term for drug use? I don't think so. Slang terms would be more like "crack", "herb", "coke", etc. "Sea of codeine" is more likely a metaphor. The post isn't explicitly talking about using codeine, but rather using it as a metaphor. So according to the rules, if it's a metaphor, then it's F. 

But I need to make sure. The rules say T includes slang for drugs. If "Sea Of Codeine" is considered slang, then it would be T. But I don't think that's the case. Slang would be more direct terms. "Sea of codeine" is a metaphor, so it's F. Therefore, the label should be F.
