Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "arrest ppl committing these crimes, instead of blaming the victims.they just smash the window, or wreck the lock.When is the last time you arrested a drug dealer...oh yeah campers legally camping on crown lands are the problem GR8t deflection Karen"

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Let me break it down.

The first part talks about arresting people committing crimes, blaming victims, smashing windows, wrecking locks. Then it asks when the last time someone was arrested for drug dealing. The next part says that campers legally camping on crown lands are the problem. The user also uses "GR8t deflection Karen" which is probably a slang or a term used in some contexts, but not sure if it's drug-related.

Looking at the key parts: "drug dealer" is mentioned directly. That's a clear indicator of T. The term "drug dealer" falls under selling drugs, which is part of the T category. Even though the rest of the post is about campers and deflection, the mention of drug dealers is enough to label it as T. The other parts might be about deflecting blame, but the presence of "drug dealer" makes it T. The "GR8t" is likely a typo for "great" or "great", but not related to drugs. So the answer should be T.
