Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Hit her with no condom.. Had to make her eat a plan B.. And I'm sippin on that codeine not brandy."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let me break down the post sentence by sentence.

The first part: "Hit her with no condom." That seems like a reference to not using a condom, which is related to sexual activity without protection. But does that involve drug use? Not directly. Maybe it's about unprotected sex, but not necessarily drugs.

Next part: "Had to make her eat a plan B." Plan B is a form of emergency contraception. So that's a medical term related to preventing pregnancy. But the user is making her eat it, which might be a metaphor or a literal action. However, the mention of Plan B here is about contraception, not drugs. Unless there's a slang term I'm missing. But Plan B is a known term for emergency contraception, so probably not a drug here.

Then: "And I'm sippin on that codeine not brandy." "Sippin on" is slang for drinking or consuming. Codeine is a narcotic, an opioid, which is an illicit drug. So that part clearly mentions codeine, which is a drug. The phrase "not brandy" might be contrasting codeine with alcohol, but the key part is codeine. So this part is definitely T.

So the post includes codeine, which is an illicit drug. Even though the other parts might not be directly related, the mention of codeine is enough to label it as T. The other parts are about sexual activity and contraception, which are F. But since there's a direct mention of codeine, which is a drug, the label should be T.
