Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Im on Ocean Drive sipin' codeine w the top down üèç".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "codeine". Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medication, but in the context of the post, it's being consumed. The user is "sipin' codeine", which is a slang term for drinking or taking codeine. The mention of "w the top down" might mean the person is driving with the top down, but the main focus here is on codeine.

Now, according to the label rules, T is for text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since the user is explicitly mentioning codeine, which is a drug, and the context is consumption, this would fall under T. The other elements like being on Ocean Drive and the top down are just contextual details but don't relate to the drug use. The emoji üèç might be a stylistic choice but doesn't change the fact that codeine is being consumed. 

So, the answer should be T.
