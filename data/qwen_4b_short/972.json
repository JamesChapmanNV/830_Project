Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Codeine and some moutain dew you never see what i go through."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, "Codeine" is definitely a drug. Codeine is an opioid, which is classified as an illicit drug. Then there's "moutain dew"â€”probably a typo for "Mountain Dew," which is a soft drink. But wait, there's a slang term "Mountain Dew" sometimes used as a slang for methamphetamine. However, in this context, it's more likely a misspelling of the actual drink. But the user might be referring to the slang. However, the main term here is Codeine, which is clearly a drug. 

The phrase "you never see what I go through" is a bit vague, but the presence of Codeine is enough to trigger the T label. Even if "Mountain Dew" is a typo, the mention of Codeine alone is sufficient. The other part about "what I go through" might be a metaphor, but the drug use is explicit. So the label should be T.
