Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about fentanyl, meth, and heroin hitting Ohio in 2021. 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: The user is asking questions about fentanyl, meth, and heroin arriving in Ohio. They're not using these drugs themselves, nor are they discussing personal use. They're just inquiring about the presence of these drugs in the area. The mention of fentanyl, meth, and heroin are all illicit drugs, but the context here is about their arrival in Ohio, not about personal use or related activities. 

The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. Since the user is asking about the presence of these drugs in a specific location and time, it's more of a news or informational query. There's no indication of personal use, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. The terms are used in a factual sense, not as slang or in a context that implies use. 

Therefore, according to the rules, this doesn't fit the T category. The post is about the spread of drugs, which is a news topic, so it should be labeled F.
