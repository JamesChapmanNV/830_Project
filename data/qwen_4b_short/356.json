Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I mean to general audience, not this crack team of sleuths. Spoiler being just how hurt might she be."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise.

Looking at the post, the key part is "crack team of sleuths." Wait, "crack" here might be a slang term. But in common usage, "crack" can refer to the drug, but in this context, it's part of a phrase "crack team," which usually means a highly skilled team. However, "crack" as a slang for cocaine is possible. But the user is moderating for drug abuse, so I need to check if "crack" is used here as a drug reference.

But the post is about a spoiler in a movie or show, mentioning "how hurt might she be." The mention of "crack" in "crack team" might be a metaphor or a reference to a team, not the drug. However, if "crack" is used as a slang term for cocaine, then it would be T. But the context here is about a group of sleuths, so "crack team" is more likely a metaphor for a top team. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is trying to trick me. But the post doesn't mention any drug use directly. The word "crack" is part of a phrase that's not clearly referring to the drug. The rest of the post is about a spoiler, not drug use. So the answer would be F because there's no direct mention of drug use, slang, or related activities. The "crack" here is part of a team name, not a drug reference. Therefore, the label should be F.
