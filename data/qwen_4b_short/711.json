Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about drug use in Pittsburgh, mentioning Meth, heroin, and crack. The rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to check if the post contains any of the T indicators. The post says "Meth has been blowing up here last few years" and lists heroin, crack, and meth as the most used. The words "blowing up" might be slang for drug use. Also, the mention of heroin, crack, and meth are all illicit drugs. The user is talking about their prevalence in the area, which could be part of discussing drug use. However, the post is more of a statement about the popularity of these drugs rather than directly using them or seeking to use them. 

But wait, the rules include "slang for drugs" as part of T. "Blowing up" could be considered slang here. Also, the list of drugs (heroin, crack, meth) are all illicit drugs. The user is discussing their usage in the area, which might be considered as showing drug use. However, the post is more about the prevalence of these drugs rather than personal use. 

But according to the rules, even if it's discussing the use of drugs, as long as it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang, it's T. The post is talking about the popularity of these drugs, which could be considered as discussing drug use. So the label would be T. Alternatively, if it's just discussing the prevalence without personal use, maybe F? Wait, the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use". If the text is discussing the use of drugs, even in a general sense, it might still be T. For example, if someone talks about how meth is popular, that's discussing drug use. So the answer is T.
