Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Especially with the montage of kuruma and narutos journey at the end of the episode. Animation, art, and FEELS was all there. Your high on crack ðŸ˜‚"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the main parts are talking about a montage from an anime (Kuruma and Naruto's journey), mentioning animation and art, and then the last part says "Your high on crack ðŸ˜‚". 

"High on crack" is a direct reference to using crack, which is an illicit drug. The slang "high" here is used in the context of drug use. Even though it's followed by an emoji, the key part is the mention of crack. 

So according to the rules, this would be a T because it's referring to drug use. The rest of the post is about the anime, but the last part clearly indicates drug use. The emoji might be just expressing a reaction, but the content itself is about using crack. 

Therefore, the label should be T.
