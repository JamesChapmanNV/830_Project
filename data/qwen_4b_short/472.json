Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "I support laws that say you can't shoot up heroin on the sidewalk outside my house or at the park my kids play or their school. Red Flag laws are tyranny and any 2A violation is an infringement. Next?"

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "shoot up heroin." "Shoot up" is a slang term for injecting drugs, which is definitely related to drug use. The mention of heroin is a specific illicit drug. The person is talking about laws preventing this activity in specific locations, which is about drug use. 

The rest of the post talks about Red Flag laws and 2A violations, which might relate to gun control, but the main focus here is on heroin use. The question is whether the post itself is about drug use. The user is supporting laws against using heroin in certain places, which is directly related to drug abuse. 

So according to the rules, T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post does mention using heroin, so it's T. The other parts about laws might be related to policy, but the core content is about drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
