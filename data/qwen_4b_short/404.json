Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about a game, mentioning "Overdose will officially be picking up making the roster" and then some comments about a player being a "straight shooter" and "1vX specialist," and that they're worth the pickup once their PC stops crashing.

First, I need to check if this post relates to drug use. The term "Overdose" is mentioned, but in this context, it's likely referring to a game character or a player's performance in a game, not actual drug use. The rest of the post talks about a player's skills and a game-related issue with their PC crashing. There's no mention of drugs, slang, buying, selling, or any other drug-related activities. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so I need to make sure there's no hidden reference. The term "overdose" could be a metaphor, but in the context of a game, it's probably not related to drug use. The rest of the post is about gaming, so it doesn't fit the T category. Therefore, the label should be F.
