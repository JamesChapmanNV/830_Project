Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "My name is khan,I am not a COCAIN dealer". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the person mentions they are not a cocaine dealer. The word "dealer" here is related to selling drugs, which is part of the trafficking or selling category. However, the person is denying being a dealer. The key is whether the post itself is showing drug use. 

But wait, the post is about not being a dealer. The term "dealer" is part of the drug-related terminology. However, the person isn't using drugs themselves; they're talking about not selling them. The rules include selling as part of T. So even though they are denying being a dealer, the mention of "dealer" could still be considered under T because it's related to drug trafficking. 

But maybe the label is about the content of the post. If the post is about not being a dealer, does that count as T? The rules state that T is when the text shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post is not about using drugs, but about not being a dealer. However, the term "dealer" is part of the drug-related terminology. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is not showing any drug use but is instead a statement about not being involved in selling. But according to the rules, even if the person is denying being a dealer, the mention of "dealer" (which is related to trafficking) might still be considered as T. 

Wait, the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs)." So if the text includes any of those terms, even if the person is denying it, does that count? For example, if someone says "I am not a drug dealer," does that count as T? 

But the label is for when the text shows drug use. If the person is not using drugs but is talking about not being a dealer, maybe that's not T. However, the term "dealer" is part of the trafficking category. So maybe the post is T because it's about trafficking. But the person is denying being a dealer, so maybe it's not showing drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is F because it's not about using drugs, but about not being a dealer. The label is for when the text shows drug use. The post is not showing drug use, but rather a denial of being involved in selling. So the answer might be F. 

But I'm a bit confused. The term "dealer" is part of the trafficking category. If the post mentions "dealer," does that count as T? The rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs)." So if the text includes any of these terms, even if the person is denying it, maybe it's T. 

But the post is "I am not a COCAIN dealer." The person is not using drugs, but they are talking about not being a dealer. However, the term "dealer" is part of the trafficking category. So the text includes a term related to trafficking. Therefore, according to the rules, this would be T. 

Wait, but the label is for when the text shows drug use. If the text is about not being a dealer, maybe it's not showing drug use. The person is not using drugs, but the term "dealer" is part of the trafficking. So maybe the answer is T because it's related to trafficking. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F because the post is not about using drugs, but about not being a dealer. The rules include "trafficking" as part of T. So if the text mentions trafficking (dealer), then it's T. 

Hmm. This is tricky. The post is about not being a dealer, but the term "dealer" is part of the trafficking category. So the text includes a term related to trafficking. Therefore, the label would be T. 

But maybe the label is only if the text is showing the act of using or being involved in drug use. If the person is denying being a dealer, maybe it's not showing drug use. However, the presence of the term "dealer" might still be considered as T. 

I think the answer is T because the post includes the term "dealer," which is related to trafficking, even though the person is denying it. Therefore, the label should be T.
