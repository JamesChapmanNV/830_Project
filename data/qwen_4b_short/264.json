Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a character named FV casting someone as "heroin" in a story, and mentions Carly knocking out Harmony and saving Alexis.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The term "heroin" is a drug, so that's a key point. However, the context here is a fictional story or role-playing, maybe from a show or game. The user is talking about a character being cast as "heroin," which could be a metaphor or a role in the narrative, not actual drug use. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The term "heroin" is a drug, but if it's used in a metaphorical or fictional context, it might not be T. However, if the post is about someone actually using heroin, then it would be T. 

In this case, the post is about a story where a character is "heroin" of every story. The term "heroin" here is likely a metaphor for a key or essential character, not actual drug use. The mention of knocking out others and saving someone is part of the plot, not drug-related actions. 

So, since there's no explicit mention of drug use, seeking, buying, etc., and it's part of a fictional narrative, the label should be F. But wait, the term "heroin" is a drug. However, the context is a story, so it's a metaphor. The rules include slang for drugs, but if it's used in a non-literal way, maybe it's not T. 

Alternatively, if the post is about a character named "Heroin" (a name), but that's not the case here. The term is used as a metaphor. Therefore, the answer is F.
