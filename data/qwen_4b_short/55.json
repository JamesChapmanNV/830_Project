Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Listen to - Kobe Codeine Ft.  (Prod. by ) by Dirty Rose Music Group #np #SoundCloud". 

First, I need to check if the text mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "Codeine". Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and can be used illicitly. But wait, the label rules specify that T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. 

So, the song title is "Kobe Codeine". The word "Codeine" is part of the title. Now, is "Codeine" considered slang for drugs here? Well, codeine is a drug, but in the context of a song title, it might be referring to the actual drug. However, the presence of the word "Codeine" in the title could be a reference to the drug. But the user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the song is about using codeine, that would be T. But the post itself is just a music post, not explicitly stating that the song is about drug use. 

Wait, the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs)". The post is just a music post, not necessarily indicating that the song is about drug use. However, the title includes "Codeine", which is a drug. But is that enough to label as T? Or is it just a song title that uses the word "Codeine" as a name, not necessarily indicating drug use?

Hmm. The rules are a bit ambiguous here. If the song's title includes the drug name, does that count as showing drug use? Or is it just a reference to the drug in the title? For example, if a song is called "Cocaine", does that mean the song is about drug use? The answer might depend on context. But in the absence of more context, the label rules might consider the presence of the drug's name in the title as T. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for explicit mentions of using, seeking, buying, etc. The title here is just a song title. Unless the song is about using codeine, which isn't stated here. The post is just a link to the song. So maybe it's F because it's not explicitly discussing drug use, just mentioning the title. 

But the rules say "slang for drugs". Codeine is a drug, so if the title is using the name of the drug, that could be considered as slang. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is F because it's just a song title, not indicating that the song is about drug use. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the post is just a music post, it's F. Unless the title is using the drug's name as a slang. But in this case, "Codeine" is the actual drug name, not slang. 

Wait, the user is moderating social media posts for drug abuse. So if the post is about a song that's related to drug use, then it's T. But the post is just a link to a song. The title is "Kobe Codeine". The name "Kobe" might be a reference to Kobe Bryant, but the song is called "Codeine". So maybe the title is using the word "Codeine" as part of the song's title, which could be a reference to the drug. But the post itself doesn't state that the song is about drug use. 

In this case, the label might be F because the post is not explicitly showing drug use, just mentioning the song title. Unless the presence of the drug's name in the title is considered as showing drug use. But according to the rules, it's T if the text shows drug use. So if the title is part of the text, then it's T. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F because the post is just a music post, not discussing drug use. The title is a song title, not a statement about drug use. Therefore, the label would be F.
