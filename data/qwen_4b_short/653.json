Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Is that a true quote? Context? Because, you know, I used to be a glue dealer ðŸ˜†"

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The user is talking about being a "glue dealer." Now, "glue" here is slang for crack cocaine, right? So that's a drug. Selling glue would be trafficking or selling drugs. So that's a T. But wait, the user is using "glue dealer" as a slang term. But the label rules include slang for drugs. So "glue" is a slang term for crack, so that's a T. The rest of the post is about questioning a quote and context, but the key part is "I used to be a glue dealer." So that's definitely T. Therefore, the label should be T.
