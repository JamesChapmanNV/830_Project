Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone discussing an overdose amount and comparing it to a court medical expert's claim. The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to check if the post mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about Tim finding a Wiki claimed overdose amount and comparing it to a court expert's claim. The user is discussing the accuracy of these amounts in the context of a case involving Floyd's blood. There's no direct mention of drug use, but rather a discussion about medical data and legal claims. 

The user is not talking about their own drug use or any specific drug-related activities. They're analyzing numbers from a Wiki and a medical expert. The mention of "overdose amount" is part of a legal or medical context, not indicating that the person is using drugs. The post is more about the comparison of data rather than the act of using drugs. 

So, according to the rules, T is for drug use related terms, and F is for other cases. Since there's no explicit mention of drug use, seeking, buying, etc., this should be labeled F. The discussion is about medical and legal analysis, not the actual use of drugs. Therefore, the correct label is F.
