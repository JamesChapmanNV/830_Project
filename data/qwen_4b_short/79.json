Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about cannabis profits in the US, mentioning specific numbers from 2019 to 2024. The key here is to determine if the post is discussing drug use, illicit activities, or something else.

First, the post talks about cannabis profits and legal aspects. It mentions legalization and tax revenues. The terms used are "cannabis," "legalized," "profits," "tax revenues." There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Instead, it's focused on the economic impact and growth of the cannabis industry. 

The label rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, and F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor. Since the post is discussing the business and economic aspects of cannabis, which is legal in some states and federal level, it's more about policy and economic data rather than drug use. The mention of profits and tax revenues is in the context of legalization, not illegal activities. Therefore, this should be labeled F.
