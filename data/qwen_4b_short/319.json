Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post says, "just found out cheese addiction is very real because cheese has morphine like compounds wtf". 

First, I need to check if this post falls under the T category, which includes text showing illicit or abusive drug use, such as using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The F category is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The key here is to determine if the post is about actual drug use or if it's a metaphor. The user mentions "cheese addiction" and that cheese has "morphine-like compounds". Morphine is a potent opioid, so if cheese actually contains morphine, that's a real drug. However, I know that cheese doesn't contain morphine. This might be a metaphor or a misunderstanding. The person is using "cheese addiction" as a metaphor for something else, perhaps a strong craving or obsession, not actual drug use. The mention of morphine-like compounds might be a joke or a misunderstanding. Since the post is not discussing actual drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang for drugs, but rather a humorous or metaphorical statement, it should be labeled F. The user is not promoting or discussing drug use, but rather making a joke about cheese. Therefore, the correct label is F.
