Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "i didn't know how much crack you have to smoke in order to say harry maguire was fantasticâ€¦"

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main subject is "crack," which is a slang term for crack cocaine, an illicit drug. The user is talking about how much crack someone needs to smoke to say that Harry Maguire was fantastic. This seems like a metaphor. The person is using the drug (crack) as a metaphor to express that someone's opinion is so extreme or exaggerated that it's like needing a lot of drugs to say that. 

But wait, is the post actually discussing the use of crack? The user is not necessarily saying they used crack, but rather using the drug as a metaphor. However, the presence of the drug name "crack" might trigger the T label if it's part of the content. But according to the rules, T includes slang for drugs. So even if it's a metaphor, the mention of the drug's name could still be considered as showing drug use. However, the context here is a metaphor. 

The key is whether the text is showing the use of the drug. If the person is using the drug in a metaphorical sense, but not actually using it, does that count? The rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use" which includes slang for drugs. So if the text uses the slang term, even in a metaphor, it might still be labeled T. But the user is not using the drug, they're using the term as a metaphor. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is about the amount of drug needed to reach a certain opinion, which could be a metaphor for how extreme the opinion is. But the presence of the drug term might still be considered as showing drug use. 

Wait, the rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the post uses the slang term, even in a metaphor, it's still T. So even if the person is not using the drug, but mentioning it, it's T. 

But in this case, the user is not using the drug. They are using the term "crack" as a metaphor. However, the term "crack" is slang for the drug. So according to the rules, even if it's a metaphor, the use of the slang term would make it T. 

But maybe the question is whether the post is about drug use. The post is about the amount of drug needed to say something, which is a metaphor. However, the presence of the drug name might still be considered as showing drug use. So the answer would be T. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is not showing drug use, but using the term as a metaphor. However, the rules might consider the use of the slang term as T. Therefore, the label is T.
