Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "BIRDS IN THE TRAP SING BRIAN MCKNIGHT PERCOCET AND CODEINE PLS DON'T TAKE MY LIFE". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, there are two parts. The first part is "BIRDS IN THE TRAP SING BRIAN MCKNIGHT". That seems like a song title or a reference to a song. "BRIAN MCKNIGHT" might be a person's name, maybe a musician. The second part is "PERCOCET AND CODEINE PLS DON'T TAKE MY LIFE". 

Percocet and codeine are both drugs. Percocet is a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen, which is a controlled substance. Codeine is an opioid. The phrase "DON'T TAKE MY LIFE" is a plea, possibly indicating someone is struggling with drug use. 

So, the presence of "PERCOCET AND CODEINE" directly points to drug use. The user is mentioning specific drugs, which falls under the T category. The "DON'T TAKE MY LIFE" part is a warning, but the key here is the explicit mention of the drugs. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that might make this F. The other part about birds in a trap and the song title doesn't relate to drug use. But the drugs are clearly listed. So the label should be T.
