Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is from Mason's mom talking about her son who's undergoing chemo. She mentions that he's off morphine but the chemo is making him sicker. Also, his body is being eliminated of white blood cells, leaving him with zero immunity. The hashtags include #leukemiawarrior.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The post talks about chemo, which is chemotherapy, a treatment for cancer. Morphine is a painkiller, but the mom says he's off of it. The key part here is the mention of chemo leading to a loss of white blood cells, which is a side effect of chemotherapy, not drug abuse. The hashtags relate to leukemia and being a warrior, which are medical terms. There's no mention of seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The text is discussing medical treatment and its effects, not drug use. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's a medical discussion, not about drug abuse. The mention of morphine is a medication, not illicit drugs. Therefore, the answer is F.
