Okay, let's see. The user provided a social media post that says, "I say everything Triple Times 333..... â€” listening to Codeine Crazy [Prod. by TM-88]". They want me to label this as T or F based on the rules given.

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key here is to identify any references to drugs. 

Looking at the text: "Triple Times" and "333" might be a reference to something else, maybe a song title or a trend. Then there's "Codeine Crazy". Codeine is a controlled substance, a type of opioid. The song title "Codeine Crazy" directly mentions codeine, which is a drug. 

So the mention of "Codeine Crazy" would fall under the T category because it's referring to a drug. Even though the rest of the text doesn't explicitly mention using or seeking, the song title itself is a slang reference to codeine. 

Therefore, the label should be T.
