Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "If u can't bring nothing to the table i don't want nothing with you âœŒ". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The keywords to look for are using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the words "nothing" are used a lot, but that's probably just a metaphor. The phrase "bring nothing to the table" is a common idiom meaning not contributing anything. The "nothing with you" might be a way of saying not wanting to be around someone. There's no mention of drugs, drug-related activities, or slang terms. 

The user is probably trying to express a refusal to engage with someone who isn't contributing. There's no indication of drug use here. So according to the rules, if there's no drug-related content, it should be labeled F. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden slang or alternative meanings. But "nothing" in this context is likely a metaphor for not contributing, not a drug reference. So the answer should be F.
