Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Car finance from the dealer on a new car is pretty cheap."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for all other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

The post here is about car finance from a dealer. The key words are "car finance," "dealer," and "new car." There's no mention of drugs, drug-related terms, or any activity related to drug use. The topic is purely about financing a car, which is a financial service. 

I should check if there's any possible slang or hidden meaning. "Finance" here is a standard term for financial services. The dealer is part of the car sales process. There's no indication of drug use or related activities. 

So, according to the rules, since there's no drug-related content, the label should be F. The post doesn't fit the criteria for T. It's a straightforward statement about car financing, which is unrelated to drugs. Therefore, the correct label is F.
