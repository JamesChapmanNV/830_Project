Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about the DuPont Family being responsible for banning cannabis in 1938 and related arrests, and now they're involved in Dr. Oz's senate bid. The user is criticizing them as the worst human beings.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key terms here are "banning cannabis," "cannabis related arrests," and "Dr. Oz's senate bid." The DuPont Family is being accused of being involved in these actions. 

But does the post itself talk about using drugs? The user is discussing historical actions related to cannabis prohibition, not necessarily current drug use. The mention of "cannabis related arrests" could be about policy or legal issues, not personal drug use. The phrase "worst human beings" is a strong statement but not directly about drug use. 

The rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use. The post is more about political figures and their historical actions, not about someone using drugs. The Dr. Oz part might be a metaphor or a political comment. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

So the label should be F because it's discussing policy and political figures, not drug use itself. The user is criticizing the DuPont Family's actions, but that's about their role in cannabis prohibition, not about drug use. Therefore, the answer is F.
