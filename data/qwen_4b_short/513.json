Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a court ruling to revoke marijuana ballot initiatives in Lamar. The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, the post mentions "recreational marijuana sales" and a court ruling on ballot initiatives. The main topic is about legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The hashtags #cannabiscommunity and #marijuana are relevant, but the content is about a legal decision, not about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use in any of those forms. The post doesn't mention personal use or any illegal activities related to drugs. It's discussing a legal matter, so it's more of a news or policy discussion. Therefore, the label should be F. 

I need to make sure there's no slang or hidden references. The term "marijuana" is used, but in this context, it's about legal sales, not abuse. So the answer is F.
