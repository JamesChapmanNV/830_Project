Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F. The post is: "Have any of you guys actually drank codeine and sprite?" 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

So the post is asking if people have actually drunk codeine and sprite. Codeine is a controlled substance, classified as a narcotic and is used in some medications, but it's also a controlled drug. The term "drank" here is key. Normally, "drank" refers to consuming alcohol, but in this context, codeine is a drug. However, the phrase "drank codeine" might be a slang or a way to refer to using codeine, which is an illicit drug. 

But wait, codeine is also a prescription medication. So the question is whether this is considered illicit drug use. The user is asking if people have actually used codeine (presumably in a non-medical way) combined with Sprite. The act of using codeine, even if it's a prescription, might be considered illicit if it's not under medical supervision. However, the label rules specify that T includes "slang for drugs." So if "drank codeine" is considered slang for using the drug, then this would be T. 

Alternatively, if the user is referring to codeine as a medication, maybe it's not considered illicit. But the question is about whether the text shows drug use. The key here is the context. The user is asking if people have actually used codeine (presumably in a way that's not medical) and combined it with Sprite. So the act of using codeine, even if it's a controlled substance, could be considered under T. 

Therefore, the label should be T because the post is about using codeine, which is an illicit drug, and the question is about personal experience with using it. The combination with Sprite might be a metaphor, but the main point is the use of codeine. So the answer is T.
