Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "And the heroin was no more than 6 years ago. Since it was 2015 when you were actively doing heroin and meth."

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "heroin" and "meth," which are both illicit drugs. The phrase "actively doing heroin and meth" clearly indicates that the person was using these drugs. The mention of the year 2015 and the time frame of 6 years ago further reinforces that this is about past drug use. 

The rules state that T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, the post directly refers to using heroin and meth, which are both controlled substances and considered illicit. There's no mention of medical use, policy discussion, or anything else that would fall under F. 

I should make sure there's no metaphorical use here. The context seems straightforwardâ€”talking about past drug use. The mention of the year and the time frame is just providing context for when the use occurred. There's no indication that "heroin" is being used metaphorically here. 

So, based on the rules, this should be labeled T because it's explicitly discussing the use of illicit drugs.
