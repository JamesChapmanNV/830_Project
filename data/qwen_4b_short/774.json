Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about dental health, specifically using teeth to chew food, ripping tape, or opening packaging, which can lead to dental issues like root canals or tooth loss. The hashtags are #dental, #oralhealth, etc.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use. The post talks about using teeth for non-drug-related activitiesâ€”chewing food, opening packaging. It's a health tip about dental care. There's no mention of drugs, drug slang, or anything related to drug use. The hashtags are all about oral health, not drugs. So according to the rules, T is for drug-related content, and F is for other cases like medical advice. Since this is a dental health warning, it's F. I should make sure there's no hidden drug reference here. The user is advising against using teeth for non-food purposes, but that's not related to drugs. So the label is F.
