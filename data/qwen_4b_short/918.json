Okay, let's tackle this label. The post says, "Keith Richards is literally freebasing heroin right now and he will outlive you." First, I need to check if this falls under T or F.

The key here is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The phrase "freebasing heroin" is a direct reference to using heroin in a way that's considered illegal and abusive. Freebasing involves inhaling the drug in a pure form, which is a method of use. So that's a clear T. 

But wait, is there any other part that might not be? The second part says "he will outlive you." That's a statement about longevity, but it's not related to drug use. However, the first part is the main focus. Since the post is stating that Keith Richards is currently using heroin, that's a T. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphor or other context. The user mentioned that F includes medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. The statement here is a direct claim about drug use, not a metaphor. So the label should be T.
