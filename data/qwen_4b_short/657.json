Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post mentions Elon Musk being a distraction because he's autistic, and how they use moral debates to distract him while doing other things. Then it talks about Canada getting fertilizer and cannabis money, telling the USA no.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The term "sundial cannabis" might be a slang reference. "Sundial" here could be a typo or slang for cannabis. Also, "fertilizer and sundial cannabis $$" â€“ the "$$" might be a typo for "dollar" or "cash," but the key part is "cannabis." 

The first part about Elon and autism doesn't seem related to drugs. The second part mentions Canada getting cannabis money, which could be referring to cannabis-related funds. The phrase "telling USA NO" might be about trade or policy, but the main point is the mention of cannabis. 

So, the presence of "cannabis" would fall under T because it's directly related to drug use. The other parts don't mention drug use, but the cannabis part is a clear indicator. Therefore, the label should be T.
