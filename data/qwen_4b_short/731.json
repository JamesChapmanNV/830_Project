Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post talks about cannabis access in 18 states, mentions 250 million Americans having access, and references a video of Joe Biden discussing cannabis reform. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, which would be T, or if it's something else like medical, policy, news, or discouraging use, which would be F.

First, the post mentions "legal, adult-use/medical cannabis." That's a bit of a red flag because it's talking about legal cannabis, but the term "illicit" or "abusive" isn't directly used. However, the context is about access and reform, which is more about policy or news. The mention of prison sentences for cannabis offenses is about the criminal justice system, which is a policy issue. The video of Biden discussing reform is a political statement. There's no direct mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Instead, it's discussing the legal status, access, and political figures' positions. So, the main topics are policy, news, and medical cannabis. Therefore, this doesn't fit the T category. The label should be F.
