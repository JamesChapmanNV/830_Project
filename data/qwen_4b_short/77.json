Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "codeine help me stop feeling ~ take me away from the pain". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the word "codeine" is mentioned. Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug. The user is asking for codeine to help them stop feeling pain and "take me away from the pain." This seems like a request for drug use. 

The phrase "help me stop feeling" and "take me away from the pain" are strong indicators of seeking drugs for their effects, which is a sign of drug use. Even though the user might be using codeine for a medical reason (like pain relief), the context here is a social media post that's likely expressing a desire to use the drug, which could be for abuse. 

The label rules specify that T includes seeking or using drugs. Since the post is asking for codeine to alleviate pain, it's a clear case of seeking drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
