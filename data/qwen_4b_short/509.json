Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about Switzerland launching a cannabis sale pilot and mentions Malta legalizing cannabis. The rules say T is for text showing drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use. The post talks about Switzerland launching a pilot for cannabis sale, and Malta legalizing recreational use. The key here is that it's discussing the legalization and sale of cannabis, which is a policy or news topic. There's no mention of actual use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The focus is on the legal aspect and attitudes changing globally. 

So, the post is reporting on news about cannabis legalization, not about someone using or seeking drugs. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's a news item discussing policy changes, not drug use. The mention of "recreational use" is part of the policy discussion, not indicating that people are using drugs. So the answer is F.
