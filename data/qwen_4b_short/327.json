Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about Paul Auster's son Daniel dying of a drug overdose while awaiting trial for killing his baby daughter with heroin and fentanyl.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "drug overdose," "heroin," and "fentanyl." Both heroin and fentanyl are classified as illicit drugs. The mention of overdose directly relates to drug use. Additionally, the context of the son being charged with killing his daughter with these drugs indicates that the drugs were used in a harmful manner. 

The rules state that T includes any text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post clearly mentions the drugs involved and the consequence of overdose, which is a direct indication of drug use. There's no mention of medical use or policy discussion here. The focus is on the drug-related death and the crime committed, which falls under T. 

I should make sure there's no ambiguity. The post doesn't use metaphors or discuss drugs in a non-literal sense. It's a factual statement about drug use leading to a death. Therefore, the correct label should be T.
