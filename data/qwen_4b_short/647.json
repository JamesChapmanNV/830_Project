Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Up, after fuck all sleep, because my left foot is being an absolute bastard again. Fuck you, left foot! Give me codeine, or give me death. â˜ "

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the user mentions "codeine," which is a controlled substance, specifically an opioid. The phrase "Give me codeine, or give me death" clearly indicates a request for the drug. Additionally, the use of "fuck you, left foot" is more about frustration with the foot, but the main point here is the mention of codeine. 

The other parts of the post are about sleep and a foot issue, but the key part is the explicit request for codeine. Since codeine is a drug and the user is seeking it, this should be labeled T. The presence of "codeine" directly falls under the T category as it's a drug. The other parts don't relate to drug use, but the mention of codeine is enough. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphor here. The user is not using codeine metaphorically; they are explicitly asking for it. So the label should be T.
