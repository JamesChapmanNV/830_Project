Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "I got morphine in the hospital and I was so out of it, having sepsis and renal failure, that it just didn't feel like anything. Except for when they tried to put a tube up my nose to my stomach, which I refused. They just carted me in."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person mentions getting morphine in the hospital. Morphine is a controlled substance, typically used for pain management. The user was in the hospital with sepsis and renal failure, which are serious medical conditions. The mention of morphine here is part of medical treatment, not illicit use. However, the phrase "I was so out of it" could be a slang term for being under the influence of drugs, but in this context, it's likely referring to the effects of morphine, which is a prescribed medication. 

The key here is whether the post is about illicit drug use. The person is describing a medical scenario where morphine was administered as part of treatment for a severe illness. The refusal to have a tube inserted is a medical procedure, not related to drug use. There's no mention of seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking drugs. The use of "out of it" might be a metaphor for being dazed or confused due to the medication, but the context is medical. 

Therefore, the post is about medical treatment and the effects of a prescribed drug, not illicit drug use. So the label should be F.
