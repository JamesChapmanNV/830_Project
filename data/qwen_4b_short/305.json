Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Codeine got me movin @ a turtle pace I show love idk why niggas hate #AllThatHating ‼️ 1k plays already ‼️👟💩 GO LISTEN"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The word "Codeine" is a controlled substance, so that's a red flag. The user is saying "Codeine got me movin," which implies they're using codeine. Even though it's a slang term here, the actual drug is mentioned. 

Next, the rest of the post: "I show love idk why niggas hate #AllThatHating" seems like a personal comment, maybe about social media trends or personal feelings. The hashtags and the mention of 1k plays might be about views or engagement, but not directly related to drug use. The emojis like 🤯👟💩 might be expressive, but not indicating drug use.

The rules state that T is for any text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Since "Codeine" is a drug and the user is referencing its use ("got me movin"), this should be labeled T. The other parts of the post don't relate to drug use, so the main focus here is the mention of codeine. Therefore, the label should be T.
