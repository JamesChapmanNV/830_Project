Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Nothing much, there are just two protest groups outside." The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug-related activities. The post talks about protest groups outside. The words "protest groups" don't directly relate to drugs. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang terms for drugs. The post is a neutral statement about protests. So according to the rules, since there's no drug use or related terms, it should be labeled F. I don't see any metaphors here either. The context is about protests, not drugs. So the answer is F.
