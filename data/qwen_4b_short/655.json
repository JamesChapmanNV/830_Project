Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post talks about Purdue Pharma, Arthur's death, and the sale of OxyContin. 

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Purdue Pharma," "OxyContin," and "morphine." OxyContin is a brand name for oxycodone, which is an opioid, a controlled substance. The mention of selling OxyContin, which is a drug, would fall under T. 

The post also mentions that Arthur's brothers were involved in directing the sale. The context is about a company involved in pharmaceuticals, specifically a drug that's known for abuse and addiction. Even though the post is about a company and its history, the mention of selling a drug (OxyContin) that's associated with illicit use would trigger the T label. 

The other part about the Sackler Faculty of Medicine might be a red herring, but the main point is the sale of OxyContin. Since the post is discussing the sale of a drug related to drug abuse, it's T. The label should be T.
