Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on whether it mentions drug use. The post is about the Women's March event in Cleveland and NYC on October 2, 2021. The key here is to check if there's any mention of drugs, their use, slang, or related terms.

Looking at the text: The user talks about "great news that people out fighting for women's rights prochoice" and mentions specific events like the Women's March. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang related to drugs. The focus is entirely on a political or social event. 

So, according to the label rules, T is for drug-related content, and F is for other cases. Since there's no drug-related content here, the label should be F. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden references or slang. The words "prochoice" and "Women's March" don't relate to drugs. Therefore, the correct label is F.
