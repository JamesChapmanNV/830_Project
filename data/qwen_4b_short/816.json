Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "omg I'm on sm codeine atm BC of my pain that my excuse I'm off it". The options are T or F. 

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. The person mentions being on "sm codeine". "Sm" could stand for "sustained release" or maybe "sm" as in "smoke", but in the context of codeine, it's more likely "sm" here is part of the drug name, like "sm codeine" might be a typo or slang. But codeine is an opioid, which is an illicit drug. However, codeine is also used in some over-the-counter medications, like cough syrups, so it's a bit ambiguous.

The user says they're on codeine because of pain and that their excuse is they're off it. The key here is whether the use is illicit or abusive. Codeine is a controlled substance, and using it without a prescription is illegal. The mention of being on it for pain could be for medical reasons, but if they're using it without a prescription or in excess, it's considered abuse. 

The label rules say T if it shows illicit or abusive use. The post doesn't mention a prescription or medical context. The person is using codeine for pain, which is a common reason for prescription, but the way it's phrased might indicate that they're using it without proper medical supervision. Also, the phrase "my excuse I'm off it" is a bit confusing, but it might imply that they are currently using it and are trying to explain their situation. 

Since codeine is a controlled substance and the post doesn't provide context of a medical prescription, it's more likely that this is considered illicit or abusive use. Therefore, the label should be T.
