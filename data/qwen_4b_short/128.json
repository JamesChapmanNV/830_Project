Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "When you realize you're the only person in your generation Who uses codeine for what it's actually for."

First, I need to check if this post falls under the T category, which includes text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, such as using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The F category is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The key here is the phrase "uses codeine for what it's actually for." Codeine is a controlled substance, typically used medically for pain relief or as a cough suppressant. However, in some contexts, it can be misused or abused. The post mentions using codeine for its actual purpose, which might be a medical use. But the user is highlighting that they are the only one in their generation doing so. 

Wait, but the problem is whether the post is indicating drug use. The phrase "uses codeine" could be seen as T if it's about using it for non-medical purposes. However, the post specifies "for what it's actually for," which might imply that the user is using it as prescribed. But the statement could also be a metaphor or a way of expressing feeling isolated in using it for its intended medical purpose. 

But the rules state that T includes "slang for drugs." However, codeine is a drug, and using it as prescribed is a medical use. However, the post might be implying that the user is using it in a way that's not typical, perhaps for non-medical reasons. But the wording is a bit ambiguous. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is saying that they are the only one in their generation using codeine for its actual medical purpose, which might be a way of highlighting that others aren't doing so. However, the key is whether the post is showing illicit or abusive use. If the user is using codeine as prescribed, that's medical, so maybe F. But if they are using it for non-medical purposes, then T. The problem is the phrasing. The post says "for what it's actually for," which could be a way of saying they are using it correctly, but maybe it's a metaphor. 

Alternatively, the user might be implying that they are using codeine for non-medical purposes, such as for pain relief in a way that's not prescribed. But the wording is unclear. However, the label rules say that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. If the post is about using codeine, even if for medical purposes, but in a way that's considered misuse, it might still be T. But the rules also mention "medical/policy discussion" as F. 

Wait, the rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the user is using codeine for its actual purpose (as a medical use), that's not illicit. But if they are using it for non-medical purposes, that's T. The post says "for what it's actually for," which could be the intended medical use, but the user is the only one in their generation doing that. However, the post might be a metaphor. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using codeine in a way that's not appropriate, but the post doesn't specify. The key is whether the post is indicating drug use. Since the post mentions "uses codeine," that's a direct reference to drug use. However, if it's for medical use, then maybe F. But the rules don't specify that medical use is F. The F category includes "medical/policy discussion," so if the post is discussing medical use, it's F. 

But the post is more about the user being the only one in their generation using codeine for its actual purpose. The actual purpose is medical, so maybe it's a medical discussion, hence F. But the user is using codeine, which is a drug. However, the label rules might consider using a drug for its intended medical purpose as not T. 

So the answer would be F. But I need to be careful. The problem is that the post is ambiguous. However, according to the rules, if it's a medical discussion, then F. The post is more about the user's experience, not necessarily discussing the medical aspects. But the key is whether it's showing illicit or abusive use. If the user is using codeine as prescribed, then it's not T. But if they are using it for non-medical purposes, then T. Since the post says "for what it's actually for," which is the intended use, then it's F.
