Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post mentions the CDC site explaining opiates and opioids. The key part here is "Her usage is correct." Wait, "Her" refers to heroin, right? So the post is talking about heroin being a opiate, which is a type of opioid. But the label rules are T if it's about drug use, and F otherwise.

The post is explaining the difference between opiates and opioids, and mentions heroin as an example. But the last sentence says "Her usage is correct." That seems like it's talking about using heroin. So that's a direct mention of drug use. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled T because it's discussing the use of heroin, which is an illicit drug. The rest of the post is factual information, but the mention of "usage" here is key. Even though it's in a context of explaining terminology, the actual statement about usage would trigger the T label. So the answer should be T.
