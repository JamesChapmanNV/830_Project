Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "My former Pot Dealer. Started selling guns and ripping people off recently. Stole my money, but I hope the $140 was worth the Karma. Sucks to be him."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the person refers to their former "Pot Dealer," which is a slang term for someone who deals in pot (marijuana). The term "Pot Dealer" is a direct reference to drug dealing. Then they mention "started selling guns and ripping people off," which is about selling guns, not drugs. The mention of stealing money is about theft, not drug use. The $140 is a vague amount, but the context is about stealing money. 

The key here is whether the post shows drug use. The person is talking about their former dealer, but the main actions here are selling guns and stealing money. The term "Pot Dealer" is a reference to drug dealing, but the post is more about the dealer's criminal activities (selling guns, stealing) rather than the dealer using drugs. The person is talking about their former dealer's actions, not their own drug use. 

The phrase "hope the $140 was worth the Karma" is a metaphor, implying that the dealer's actions have consequences, but not directly related to drug use. The label F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor. 

So, even though "Pot Dealer" is a drug-related term, the post is more about the dealer's criminal activities (selling guns, stealing) and the speaker's reaction. There's no direct mention of the speaker using drugs, seeking drugs, buying/selling drugs, or any slang for drugs beyond the term "Pot Dealer." The main focus is on the dealer's actions, not the speaker's drug use. Therefore, the label should be F because the post is about the dealer's activities, not the speaker's drug use. The term "Pot Dealer" might be a red herring, but the context doesn't indicate the speaker is using drugs. The post is more about the dealer's crimes, so it's not T.
