Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is in Korean with some hashtags. Let me break it down.

First, the hashtags: #2 EXO, #6 LOTTO, #8 MAMA, #10 OVERDOSE. Then there are other hashtags like #9ToEternityWithEXO, #9YearswithEXO, #EXO9thAnniversary, and some Korean phrases. The main thing here is to check if any of the content relates to drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs.

Looking at the hashtags, #10 OVERDOSE stands out. "Overdose" is directly related to drug use, specifically a medical term related to drug abuse. The other hashtags are about EXO, a K-pop group, and lotto, which is a game. The Korean phrases are also about EXO and their anniversary, so they don't relate to drugs. 

The rule says T if there's any mention of drug use. Since #OVERDOSE is a direct reference to drug overdose, which is a form of illicit drug use, this should be labeled T. The other parts of the post don't mention drugs, so the presence of #OVERDOSE is enough to trigger the T label.
