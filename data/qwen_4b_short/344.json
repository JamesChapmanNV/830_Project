Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about medical examiners confirming that George Floyd didn't die from an overdose. The user mentions the medical report and interviews being available, but then says "fall into the 'push the narrative' trap."

First, I need to check if the post contains any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The main points here are about autopsies, medical reports, and the cause of death. The key term here is "overdose," which is related to drug use. However, the post is discussing a medical confirmation that Floyd didn't die from an overdose. The user is talking about the medical findings, not their own use of drugs or any slang related to drugs.

The phrase "push the narrative" might be a metaphor, but the main content is about medical reports and the cause of death. There's no mention of using drugs, seeking, buying, selling, or any slang terms. The label rules state that T is for text showing drug use, and F is for other cases like medical discussions. Since the post is discussing medical reports and the cause of death (overdose), but the conclusion is that he didn't die from an overdose, it's a medical/policy discussion. Therefore, the label should be F.
