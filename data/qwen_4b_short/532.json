Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I don't want to be the kind to push someone when their back is turned ðŸ¥´". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main phrase is "I don't want to be the kind to push someone when their back is turned". The emoji is a face with tears of joy, which might be a metaphor. The key here is whether there's any mention of drugs or drug-related activities. The words "push someone when their back is turned" could be a metaphor for being pushy or confrontational, not necessarily related to drugs. There's no explicit mention of drugs, slang, or any drug-related actions. The emoji doesn't seem to relate to drugs either. 

So, the post is more about interpersonal behavior rather than drug use. Therefore, it doesn't fit the T category. The answer should be F.
