Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about Teva Pharma and Cephalon, mentioning a legal case related to Actiq. The task is to determine if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, or if it's something else.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, policy, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: "Teva Pharma News Cephalon says Travelers lacks authority to bring Actiq suit: Cephalon says Tr..." 

This seems to be a news headline or a statement about a legal dispute between pharmaceutical companies. Actiq is a brand name for a medication containing fentanyl, which is a controlled substance. However, the post is not discussing the use of drugs, but rather a legal case between companies. The mention of Actiq is in the context of a lawsuit, not about someone using or seeking the drug. 

The key here is whether the text is about drug use. Since the post is about a legal matter involving a drug product (Actiq) but not about individuals using, selling, or seeking it, it doesn't fit the T category. It's more of a news or legal discussion. Therefore, the correct label should be F.
