Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about choosing between White Zombie and Morphine, mentioning "Astro-Creep" as a Top 20 metal album. 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The terms "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs" are the key here. The post talks about music bands and an album, which seems like a music discussion. The words "White Zombie" and "Morphine" are band names. "Astro-Creep" is the album title. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any related terms. The user is talking about music preferences, not drug-related activities. 

The label rules say T if it's about drug use, otherwise F. Since there's no drug reference here, it should be F. The mention of "coolness points" is metaphorical, not related to drugs. So the answer is F.
