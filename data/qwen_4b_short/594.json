Okay, let's tackle this labeling problem. The user wants to know if the given social media post should be labeled T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about someone who left high school at 16 to go to college and later, when they returned to walk with their graduating class, several people told them they had heard they died of a heroin overdose. The person clarifies they had never used drugs.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is whether the text mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The person in the post says they "had never done drugs in my life," so they're not using drugs. However, the post mentions that others believed they died of a heroin overdose. But the person is not actually using drugs; they're talking about others' beliefs. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use. Since the person is not using drugs, but others are misinformed, the post is about the misconception. The actual drug use isn't mentioned here. The person is not using heroin, and the others' belief is a rumor. Therefore, the post doesn't show drug use but rather a situation where others have a wrong belief. 

So the label should be F because it's not about drug use. The post is more about the person's experience with others' misinformation, not actual drug use. The mention of heroin is in the context of others' beliefs, not the person's own actions. Therefore, it's not T. The correct label is F.
