Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about the person being woken up by their mom, who told them to call off work because hospice left their house and started their grandma on morphine. The person refers to this as their worst nightmare.

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post mentions morphine, which is a medication used in hospice care for pain management. Morphine is a controlled substance, but in this context, it's being used medically for a terminally ill patient. The person isn't using it for recreational purposes or engaging in any illegal activity. The mention of morphine is part of a medical situation, not drug abuse or illicit use. The post also doesn't mention any slang terms or activities related to drug use. The user is expressing distress about their grandmother's condition, not about drug use. Therefore, the label should be F because it's a medical situation, not drug abuse. The key here is that morphine is prescribed for medical reasons, not as a drug being used illicitly. So the answer is F.
