Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "PAS only concerned on the name itself, they the one loudly asked for arak ban in malaysia but now so damn quite like a mice". 

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The mention of PAS (which I know is the Islamic Party of Malaysia) and arak (a type of palm wine, which is a controlled substance in Malaysia). The user is talking about PAS being concerned with the name of arak and previously advocating for a ban but now being quiet like a mouse.

Now, applying the label rules. T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use or related activities. The mention of "arak ban" is about a ban on arak, which is a controlled substance. However, the post is not explicitly stating that PAS is using or seeking arak. It's more about their stance on banning arak. The phrase "they the one loudly asked for arak ban" suggests they were in favor of a ban, but now they are quiet. 

But the post doesn't mention any actual use of drugs. It's more about political stance or policy discussion. However, arak is a controlled substance, so maybe the mention of it could be considered as related to drugs. However, the post isn't about using or seeking arak, but rather about the political actions regarding a ban. 

Wait, the rules include "slang for drugs". Is "arak" considered slang for drugs here? Or is it a specific substance that's controlled? In Malaysia, arak is a traditional drink, but it's banned in some contexts. However, the post is about the political stance towards banning it, not about using it. 

So the post is discussing a political issue related to a banned substance, but not directly about using or seeking it. Therefore, it might fall under F, as it's a policy discussion. However, the presence of the term "arak" which is a controlled substance might make it T. But the post isn't about using or seeking it. It's about the political actions of PAS regarding a ban. 

Alternatively, if the post is using "arak" as a slang term for drugs, but in reality, arak is a specific drink. So maybe it's a policy discussion. Therefore, the label should be F. But I need to be careful. The rules say T if the text shows drug use. Since the post is not about using, but about a ban, it's F. 

So the answer is F.
