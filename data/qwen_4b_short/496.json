Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "You'd think they'd want to crack down on CRACK. But who am I to tell you how to raise your kid named Hunter?" 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the first part mentions "crack down on CRACK." CRACK here is a slang term for cocaine, right? So that's definitely a drug reference. The mention of "crack down" implies law enforcement action against drug use, which relates to drug abuse. The second part talks about raising a kid named Hunter. That seems like a personal statement, maybe about parenting. 

But the key here is whether the post is showing drug use. The first part is about cracking down on crack, which is a drug. However, the user is not explicitly stating that they are using or seeking crack. They're talking about someone else's situation. The second part is about raising a child, which is unrelated. 

But wait, the first part is about the government or authorities cracking down on crack, which is a drug. The post is discussing a policy or social issue related to drug abuse. However, the rules specify that T is when the text shows drug use. The post is not about the person using the drug, but rather talking about the government's response to drug use. So maybe that's more of a policy discussion, which would be F. 

Alternatively, if the mention of "crack" is considered a slang term for drugs, then the post is discussing a drug-related issue, which might be T. But the rules say T is when the text shows drug use, not just mentioning the drug. The post is not about the person using the drug, but about the government's actions. So maybe it's F because it's a policy discussion. 

Wait, the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs)." So if the text includes the slang term for drugs, even if it's not the person using it, maybe it's T? Or is it only when the person is using the drug? 

Hmm, the example given in the rules is that T includes slang for drugs. So if the post mentions "crack" as a slang term, even if it's not the person using it, but the context is about drug abuse, maybe that's T. But the user is not using the drug, they're talking about someone else's kid. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is discussing a drug-related issue, which is a T. But the rules are about the text showing drug use. The post is not about the person using the drug, but about the government's response. So maybe it's F. 

I think the key is whether the text is showing drug use. The post is talking about crack (a drug) and the government's response, which is a policy discussion. So the answer would be F. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. 

The rules say T is when the text shows drug use. If the text is discussing a drug (like crack) in a context related to drug abuse, even if it's not the person using it, maybe it's T. But the example might be different. Wait, the user is not using the drug; they're talking about others. So maybe it's F. 

Alternatively, the mention of "crack" as a slang term is part of the text, so that's T. But the rest of the sentence is about parenting, which is unrelated. But the overall text is about a drug-related topic, so maybe T. 

I think this is a bit ambiguous. However, according to the rules, if the text includes the slang for drugs, even if it's not the person using it, it's T. So the answer would be T. But wait, the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs)." So if the text includes the slang term, then it's T. So the post is talking about "crack," which is a slang term for cocaine, so that's T. Therefore, the label is T. 

But wait, the user is not using the drug, but the text is discussing the drug. The rules might consider that as T. Alternatively, if the text is about the drug in a policy context, maybe it's F. 

This is tricky. Let me think again. The rules say T is when the text shows drug use. So if the text is about the drug, even if it's not the person using it, but the text is discussing the drug's use, then it's T. For example, if someone says "crack is a big problem," that's T. But if the text is about a policy discussion, maybe it's F. 

But the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs)." So the presence of the slang term would make it T. Therefore, the answer is T.
