Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I was going for drug dealer 🤣🤣🤣 but 🤷🏽‍♀️". 

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post: The user says "I was going for drug dealer". The phrase "going for a drug dealer" could be interpreted in different ways. It might mean they were trying to approach a drug dealer, which would be T because it's about seeking or interacting with someone involved in drug trafficking. However, it could also be a metaphor or slang. The emojis are laughing (🤣) and a hand wave (🤷🏽‍♀️), which might indicate the user is being humorous or dismissive. 

But the key part is "going for drug dealer". If someone is "going for" a dealer, that could imply they are seeking to engage with them, which is related to drug use. However, the phrase might not necessarily mean they are using drugs. It could be a metaphor for something else, like a social situation. But the presence of "drug dealer" is a direct reference to someone involved in drug trafficking, which falls under T. 

Alternatively, if "going for" is a slang term for something else, but in this context, without more context, it's safer to assume that "drug dealer" is a direct reference. The user might be joking, but the label rules don't consider intent or context for metaphors. The presence of the term "drug dealer" itself is enough for T. 

Wait, the rules mention "slang for drugs". If "going for a drug dealer" is a slang term for something else, but I don't think that's the case. The term "drug dealer" is a direct reference to someone selling drugs. So the act of going after a drug dealer could be part of trafficking or selling, which is T. 

Alternatively, if the user is just making a joke, like "I was going after a drug dealer but then I backed out", that's a metaphor. But the rules say to label T if it's about drug use, seeking, buying, selling, etc. The post is ambiguous, but the presence of "drug dealer" is a direct reference. The emojis might indicate the user is being sarcastic or humorous, but the label rules don't account for that. So, according to the rules, the presence of the term "drug dealer" would make it T. 

But maybe the user is using "going for a drug dealer" as a metaphor for something else, like a social situation. However, without more context, the safest answer based on the rules is T because the text directly mentions a drug dealer, which is part of the illicit drug use category.
