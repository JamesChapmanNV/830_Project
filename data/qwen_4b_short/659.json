Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about two men being charged with drug-related crimes. They seized drugs worth Â£4 million, including heroin and cocaine. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, the post mentions "seized drugs" which are heroin and cocaine. Both are illicit drugs. The men were charged after police raids, so it's about drug trafficking or possession. The terms "seized," "heroin," and "cocaine" are all directly related to drug abuse. The post doesn't mention medical use or policy discussions. It's news about drug crimes, so according to the rules, that should be labeled T. The answer should be T.
