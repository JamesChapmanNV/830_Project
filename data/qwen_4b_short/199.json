Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "DMX's Children Arrive At Hospital Amid 'Grim' Prognosis Following Overdose". 

First, I need to check if this post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "overdose". Overdose is a direct indicator of drug use, especially if it's a fatal overdose. The mention of DMX's children arriving at the hospital with a grim prognosis suggests that there was an overdose incident. 

Now, according to the label rules, T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The term "overdose" here is a direct result of drug use, so it falls under T. The other part of the post is about the prognosis and the hospital visit, which are related to the overdose but don't add any other context. 

The alternative label F is for medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor. This post is reporting on a real event involving an overdose, which is a medical issue related to drug use. However, the main point here is the overdose itself, which is a clear indication of drug use. 

I should make sure there's no metaphorical use here. The term "overdose" is a literal term, not a metaphor. So the label should be T. The answer is T.
