Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Presumably, because he died of a drug overdose."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rule says T if the text mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post mentions "drug overdose," which is a direct reference to drug use leading to death. 

But wait, the label rules say T is for text that shows drug use. The phrase "died of a drug overdose" is a result of drug use. So even though it's not directly stating someone is using drugs, it's indicating that the cause of death was a drug overdose, which is a form of drug use. 

However, the user's instruction says to label T if the text shows drug use. The post is talking about someone's death due to an overdose, which is a consequence of drug use. But does the post itself show the act of using drugs? Or is it just stating the cause of death? 

The key here is whether the text directly mentions drug use. The phrase "died of a drug overdose" is a result of using drugs, so it's a form of drug use. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled T. 

But wait, the rules also include "slang for drugs." Is "overdose" considered slang? No, "overdose" is a term used to describe the consequence of drug use, not slang. However, the act of overdosing is a result of using drugs, so the text is showing drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is just stating a cause of death without directly mentioning the use. But the term "drug overdose" is a direct reference to drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
