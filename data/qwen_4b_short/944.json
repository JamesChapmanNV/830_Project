Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F. The post is: "Flying J gas stations smells like bbq sauce and heroin". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, F.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any of those things. The post talks about the smell of heroin. Heroin is an illicit drug, so that's a direct mention. The phrase "smells like heroin" is a bit odd, but it's still a direct reference to the drug. Even if it's a metaphor, the presence of the drug name itself would trigger the T label. But wait, the rules say "slang for drugs" as well. So if "heroin" is considered a slang term here, but heroin is a specific drug, not slang. However, the key is whether the text shows drug use. The post is stating that the gas station smells like heroin, which is a direct reference to the drug. So that would be T. The other part about bbq sauce is just a comparison, but the heroin part is the key. So the answer should be T.
