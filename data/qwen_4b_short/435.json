Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F. The post is: "#MoodðŸ˜ˆ Future - '16 Codeine Crazy [Prod. By TM-88]' using app #mymixtapez". 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise.

Looking at the post, the song title is "16 Codeine Crazy". The word "Codeine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. So that's a direct mention of a drug. Even though it's in a song title, the presence of the drug name itself would trigger the T label. The hashtag #MoodðŸ˜ˆ might be related to mood, but the key part here is the song title. Also, the app mentioned is #mymixtapez, which is a music app, but that's not relevant here. 

The user is moderating for drug abuse, so even if it's in a song, the mention of codeine, which is an illicit drug, would count. So the answer should be T.
