Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post says, "Omg that sounds like FRAUD The f-word is crack cocaine for a certain type of investor."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the user mentions "FRAUD" and then explains that "the f-word is crack cocaine for a certain type of investor." The key here is whether the post is referring to drug use. The term "f-word" here is being used as a slang term for crack cocaine. The user is using the term "f-word" as a slang for a drug, which would fall under the T category because it's referring to drug use. However, the context is that the user is talking about "FRAUD" and the "f-word" being a slang term. But the main point is that they are using the term "f-word" as a slang for crack cocaine, which is a drug. So that would be T. But wait, the user is using "f-word" as a slang term for crack cocaine. However, the post is in the context of talking about fraud, so maybe it's a metaphor? Or is it actually referring to drug use?

Wait, the user is saying that the "f-word" is a slang for crack cocaine. So they are using the term "f-word" as a slang term for a drug. That would be T because it's using a slang term for a drug. However, the first part says "Omg that sounds like FRAUD" which might be a metaphor. But the second part is explicitly stating that "f-word" is crack cocaine. So that's directly referring to drug slang. Therefore, the label should be T. But I need to make sure that the "f-word" is indeed a slang term for a drug. In some contexts, "f-word" can be a slang term for a drug, like crack cocaine. So the post is using that term, which is a slang for drug use. Therefore, the label is T.
