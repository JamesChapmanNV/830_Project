Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about whether something explains why people died before, mentioning looking at a wake, feeling nervous nerve system, and whether it works for pain relief or causes more pain, with an example of morphine used by cancer patients.

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "morphine" and "pain relief." Morphine is a drug, but it's also a medical painkiller. The post is discussing its use in cancer patients, which is a medical context. The user is asking about the effects of the drug, whether it causes pain relief or more pain. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang). F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. 

The post is not using slang or discussing illegal drug use. It's talking about morphine's medical application. Even though morphine is a controlled substance, the context here is medical, not illicit. The user is inquiring about its effects, not using or distributing it. So, this should be labeled F. 

I need to make sure there's no hidden slang or mention of drug use beyond the medical context. The mention of "morphine" is a drug, but since it's in a medical discussion about pain relief, it's not T. Therefore, the correct label is F.
