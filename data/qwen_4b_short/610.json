Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking to determine if the given social media post falls under T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (all other cases). The post is: "I gotta bitch for everyday of the week & I gotta brick for every crack on yo street".

First, I need to break down the words and phrases. The key terms here are "bitch" and "brick". The user is using "bitch" which is slang for "bitch", but in this context, it's part of the phrase "gotta bitch". Wait, "bitch" in slang can sometimes refer to a drug, like "bitch" as a slang term for a drug, but I'm not sure. Then "brick" is a common slang term for a brick of cocaine. So "brick" here is definitely a drug reference. 

The second part is "for every crack on yo street". "Crack" here is a slang term for crack cocaine. So the post is using "brick" and "crack" which are both slang for drugs. The user is talking about "gotta brick" and "crack on yo street", which implies they are referencing drug use. 

So the post is using drug slang, specifically "brick" and "crack", which are associated with illicit drug use. Therefore, this should be labeled T. The other parts like "bitch" might be a bit confusing, but in this context, since "brick" is a drug, and "crack" is also a drug, the entire post is about drug use. So the answer is T.
