Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "IS IT CRACK? COCAINE OR METH YOU SMOKE!???"

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post is asking whether something is crack, cocaine, or meth, which are all illicit drugs. The user is probably trying to identify which drug they're referring to. The question is about the classification of these drugs, which are all controlled substances. The use of the words "crack," "cocaine," and "meth" directly refers to drugs that are considered illicit. Even though the post is a question, the mention of these drugs falls under the T category because they are slang for drugs. The exclamation marks and the use of "you smoke" might indicate that the person is discussing drug use, which is part of the T category. There's no mention of medical use, policy, news, or metaphors here. So the correct label should be T.
