Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "#MedASSIST is kicking goals with >2 million records of OTC #codeine meds in real time". The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, or F for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

First, I need to parse the content. The hashtag #MedASSIST is likely referring to a medical or public health initiative. The mention of "OTC #codeine meds" refers to over-the-counter codeine medications. Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medications for coughs or pain, but it's also a controlled drug because of its potential for abuse. However, the key here is whether the post is indicating drug use or abuse.

The phrase "kicking goals" is a slang term, often used in sports or in a metaphorical sense, but in the context of drug use, it can be a slang for using drugs. However, the main focus here is on the OTC codeine meds. The post is talking about tracking OTC codeine medications in real time. This seems like a public health monitoring effort, possibly related to tracking the distribution or usage of codeine medications to prevent abuse or misuse. 

But wait, codeine is a controlled substance, and OTC codeine is available in some countries, but it's regulated. The post is about tracking these medications, which could be part of a policy or medical discussion. However, the term "kicking goals" might be a red flag. If "kicking goals" is a slang term for using drugs, then the post could be T. But if it's just a metaphor or a sports reference, then it's F. 

But the main subject is OTC codeine meds. The fact that they are tracking them in real time could be part of a medical or policy discussion, which would be F. However, the use of codeine is a controlled substance, so if the post is indicating that people are using these medications in a way that's abusive, then it's T. 

But the post doesn't explicitly state that people are using them for abuse. It's more about tracking the availability or distribution. So maybe it's F. However, codeine is a drug, and OTC codeine is a controlled substance. The term "OTC" is over-the-counter, but in some places, codeine is only available with a prescription. But the post is about tracking OTC codeine, which could be a sign of misuse. However, the post is about monitoring, not about use. 

Alternatively, the post could be a news or policy discussion about tracking these medications. So the label would be F. Unless the term "kicking goals" is a slang for drug use. But I'm not sure. If the user is moderating for drug abuse, then any mention of codeine, even OTC, could be a T. But the context is about tracking, not using. 

Hmm. The key is whether the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post is about tracking OTC codeine meds, which is a medical or policy discussion. Therefore, the label is F. Unless the tracking is for abuse, but the post doesn't indicate that. So the answer is F.
