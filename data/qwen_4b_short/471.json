Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "She want me to quit that lean, baby I can't quit that lean, put a 💍 around codeine". 

First, I need to understand what the terms here mean. The label rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words are "lean" and "codeine". I know that "lean" is a slang term for cocaine. So that's definitely a drug reference. Then there's "codeine", which is an opioid, often used in medications but also a controlled substance. The phrase "put a 💍 around codeine" is a bit unclear, but "put a 💍" might be a reference to a tattoo or some kind of mark, but in this context, it's likely a slang term. However, the main point here is the mention of codeine, which is a drug.

The user is talking about wanting to quit "that lean" (cocaine) and struggling with codeine. The mention of codeine is a direct reference to a drug. So according to the rules, this would fall under T because it's discussing drug use. The other parts like "She want me to quit" might be about seeking help, but the key is the drugs mentioned. The 💍 could be a symbol related to drug use, but even if it's a metaphor, the presence of codeine and lean (cocaine) makes it T. So the answer should be T.
