Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "So, imagining yourself to be one of these otherwise reasonably intelligent people, what is the story you are telling yourself about why NOT to invest in the cannabis sector?"

First, I need to check if this post involves illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The post is about discussing why not to invest in the cannabis sector. Cannabis here is likely referring to marijuana, which is a drug. But the context is about investment, not personal use. The user is talking about the cannabis industry, which might be legal in some places, but the post isn't about using the drug. It's more about financial investment. 

I need to check if there's any slang or mention of drug use. The term "cannabis" is a drug, but the post is about investing in the sector. The question is about the reasons not to invest, not about personal use. So, the post is discussing a business or financial topic related to cannabis, not about using or dealing with drugs. 

Therefore, according to the rules, since it's not about drug use but a discussion on investment, it should be labeled F. The answer is F.
