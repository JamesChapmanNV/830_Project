Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "thanks. I've taken a night nurse! Just one, not two. Codeine hates me so I try to avoid it".

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: The person mentions "taken a night nurse". Wait, "night nurse" might be a slang term. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or a misstatement. Then they say "just one, not two" – maybe referring to dosage? Then "Codeine hates me so I try to avoid it". Codeine is a drug, specifically an opioid. The person is talking about avoiding codeine because it "hates" them. 

So the key parts here are "Codeine hates me" and "try to avoid it". Codeine is a drug, and the person is avoiding it. But does that count as drug use? The user is avoiding codeine, which is a drug. However, the post doesn't explicitly state that they are using codeine. They are avoiding it. But the mention of codeine is a direct reference to a drug. Also, the phrase "Codeine hates me" is a metaphor? Or is it a slang term? 

Wait, the user is saying they are avoiding codeine because it "hates" them. That might be a metaphor, but it's also possible that they are using codeine and it's causing issues. However, the main point is that the post is about avoiding codeine. But the label rules include any mention of drug use, even if it's avoiding. Wait, the rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if they are avoiding codeine, is that considered drug use? Or is it just a reference to the drug without using it?

Alternatively, maybe "taken a night nurse" is a typo. Maybe they meant "taken a night shift nurse" or something else. But that's unclear. Alternatively, "taken a night nurse" could be a slang term for something else. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the mention of codeine is a direct reference to a drug. 

In the label rules, if the text shows drug use, even if it's avoiding, does that count? The rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs". So avoiding codeine is not using, seeking, buying, etc. But the mention of codeine is slang for drugs. So the text includes a reference to codeine, which is a drug. But is that enough to label as T?

Alternatively, maybe the user is talking about taking codeine, but they are avoiding it. The post says "I try to avoid it" – so they are not using it. However, the fact that they mention codeine as a drug is a reference to drugs. But according to the rules, does mentioning the name of a drug count as T? The rules say "slang for drugs" as well. So if codeine is considered a drug, then mentioning it would be T. But the user is not using it, just avoiding it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using codeine. The phrase "Codeine hates me so I try to avoid it" – if they are using codeine and it's causing issues, then that would be T. But the wording is a bit unclear. "Codeine hates me" is a metaphor, but the person is avoiding it. 

I think the key here is that codeine is a drug, and the post mentions it. So even if the person is avoiding it, the mention of codeine is a reference to a drug, which would be T. But according to the rules, T is for text that shows drug use, which includes using, seeking, etc. So if they are avoiding it, maybe it's not T. But the mention of codeine is a slang term for drugs. So the text includes a reference to a drug. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is talking about taking codeine, but they are avoiding it. The post says "I try to avoid it", so they are not using it. Therefore, the text is about avoiding codeine, which is a drug, but not using it. However, the rules might consider mentioning the drug as T. 

But according to the label rules, T is for text that shows drug use. If the text is about avoiding a drug, does that count as T? The rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs". So if the text mentions a drug (codeine) as slang, then that would be T. But the user is not using it, just avoiding. 

This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the example, if someone mentions a drug, even if they are avoiding it, it might still be T. Because the presence of the drug's name is considered a reference to drug use. Alternatively, if the text is about avoiding a drug, maybe it's F. 

But according to the rules, "slang for drugs" is included. So if codeine is considered a drug, then the mention of codeine is slang for drugs. Therefore, the text is T. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using codeine. The phrase "I try to avoid it" could mean they are using it, but they are trying to avoid it. But the text is not clear. However, the mention of codeine is a drug, so the label would be T. 

I think the answer here is T because the text mentions codeine, which is a drug, and the user is discussing their relationship with it. Even though they are avoiding it, the mention of the drug is a direct reference to drug use. So the label is T.
