Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Fentanyl Floyd died of overdose. Get over it." 

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post: "Fentanyl Floyd died of overdose." Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, which is an illicit drug. The mention of Floyd (probably referring to George Floyd, who died from a drug overdose) is a real event. The phrase "died of overdose" directly relates to drug use. The second part, "Get over it," is a response to the event, but the main content here is about the cause of death, which is drug-related.

So the first part is T because it's discussing the use of fentanyl and the overdose. The second part is more of a reaction, but the key part is the first sentence. The label should be T. But wait, the rules say T includes "slang for drugs." Fentanyl is a drug, so that's T. The mention of overdose is a direct result of drug use. Therefore, the label is T. The second part is just a comment, but the main content is T.
