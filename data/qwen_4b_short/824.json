Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about Sister Morphine and BB by Wilson, mentioning "doo-wah" shit and some songs.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The labels T include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about "Sister Morphine," which is a song by The Rolling Stones. Wait, "Morphine" is a drug, right? But here it's part of a song title. However, the user is referring to the song, not the drug itself. The mention of "doo-wah" might be a slang term, but I'm not sure. The post is discussing music, specifically criticizing the song's "doo-wah" part. There's no direct mention of drug use, seeking, buying, etc. The words "Morphine" could be a reference to the drug, but in this context, it's a song title. The user is talking about music, not drug use. So maybe it's F because it's a metaphor or discussion about music, not actual drug use. The "doo-wah" might be a slang, but I'm not certain. However, the main point is that the post is about music and not directly about drug use. So the label should be F.
