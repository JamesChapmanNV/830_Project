Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about the murder of JFK, the war in Vietnam, and the Golden Triangle heroin trade.

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use directly. The post talks about the Golden Triangle and heroin trade. The Golden Triangle is a region known for opium production, so heroin is a drug. The mention of the heroin trade would fall under drug trafficking or selling, which is part of the T category. 

But wait, the post is more about the political context of JFK's assassination and the Vietnam War. However, the mention of the heroin trade is a key point here. Even though the main topic is political, the specific reference to heroin trade is a drug-related activity. 

The rules state that T includes any text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post mentions "heroin trade," which is selling or trafficking. So even if the main context is political, the presence of heroin trade would make it T. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphorical use. The post seems to be stating facts about the heroin trade in the context of the war, not using drugs metaphorically. So the label should be T.
