Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is about products labeled "rosin-enhanced" and Wana Spectrum gummies. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

First, I need to read the post carefully. The user is talking about products made from cannabis. They mention "rosin-enhanced" products aren't true live rosin but are made with frozen cannabis and dried trim. Then they talk about Wana Spectrum gummies made entirely from frozen plant matter, preserving active cannabinoids and terpenes.

Now, the key here is to determine if this post is discussing drug use. The terms used are "cannabis," "active cannabinoids," "terpenes," which are related to cannabis, but the post is explaining the composition of products. The user isn't necessarily talking about using drugs, but rather the ingredients and processing methods of these products. There's no mention of using, selling, seeking, or trafficking drugs. Instead, it's more about the product's ingredients and their benefits.

However, I need to check if "rosin" or "cannabis" are considered slang for drugs. Rosin is a resin from cannabis plants, so it's a component of cannabis. But the post is discussing the composition of products, not the use of drugs. The mention of "live rosin" and "frozen plant matter" is about the product's ingredients, not the act of using drugs. The post is informative, explaining what the products are made of, not promoting or discussing drug use. Therefore, it doesn't fit the T category. The label should be F.
