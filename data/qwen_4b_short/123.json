Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Because no one tell me what the fuck I do. And if they put me out on the street I would just become a meth dealer."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the person is talking about becoming a meth dealer. "Meth dealer" directly refers to selling methamphetamine, which is a controlled substance. That's trafficking, so that's a T. Also, the phrase "the fuck I do" might be slang, but the main point here is the mention of becoming a dealer. 

The other part is "no one tell me what the fuck I do." The "fuck" here is a strong word, but the key is whether it's related to drug use. The main issue is the threat of becoming a meth dealer, which is clearly related to drug trafficking. 

So even though there's some slang, the main content is about selling meth, which is a T. Therefore, the label should be T.
