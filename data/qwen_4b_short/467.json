Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post mentions "Watching OUTER BANKS" and lists some characters, one of whom is "Barry the drug dealer." 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rule says T if there's mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The character Barry is referred to as a "drug dealer," which directly relates to selling drugs. That seems like a clear T. 

But wait, is the term "drug dealer" considered slang or a direct reference to drug use? The label rules include "selling" as part of T. So even though it's a character in a show, the term "drug dealer" is explicitly about selling drugs. Therefore, the post does show drug use (selling) and should be labeled T. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that might make it F. The post is about a TV show, but the mention of the character as a drug dealer is a direct reference to drug trafficking. So the answer should be T.
