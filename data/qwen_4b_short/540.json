Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post mentions "cuntER is just advertising Pedo joe's" and "FREE CRACK PIPES". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The term "crack pipes" is definitely related to drugs. Crack is a slang term for cocaine, and pipes are used for smoking it. Also, "FREE CRACK PIPES" is a clear indicator of drug distribution. 

The mention of "Pedo joe's" might be a typo or a misspelling. If "Pedo" is short for "pedophile", that's a different issue, but the context here is about drug-related content. The phrase "10% for the big guy" and "seeing he will be Joes biggest customer" suggests some form of transaction or sale, which could be related to drug trafficking. 

The post also has a note about "the smartest man joe knows," which might be a reference to someone involved in drug activities. Since there's a direct mention of crack pipes and the context of selling or distributing them, this fits under T. 

I should make sure there's no metaphorical use here. The terms are straightforward and directly related to drug use. Therefore, the correct label is T.
