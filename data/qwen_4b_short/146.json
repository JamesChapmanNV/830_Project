Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Games have to cater to everyone is the most retarded take I have ever seen". The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drugs or drug-related terms. The post talks about games and catering to everyone, and uses the word "retarded". The key here is whether any drug-related terms are present. The words "retarded" is a slang term, but is it considered slang for drugs? Wait, "retarded" is more of a derogatory term, not directly related to drugs. The post doesn't mention any drugs, drug use, or related activities. The user is talking about games and a viewpoint on gaming, not drug use. So, there's no mention of drugs here. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's not related to drug use. The term "retarded" might be a metaphor or an insult, but not a drug slang. So the answer is F.
