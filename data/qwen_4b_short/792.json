Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Matter number 13 on Judge Malindi's unopposed motion roll of 27 Jan". 

First, I need to check if this post mentions anything related to drug use. The label rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, it's talking about a legal matter, specifically a motion roll by a judge. The mention of "Judge Malindi" and "Matter number 13" seems to be related to a legal proceeding. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, slang, or any related terms. The date is 27 Jan, but that's just a date. 

So, the post is about a legal motion, not discussing drugs or any related activities. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's not related to drug abuse or illicit drug use. There's no indication of any drug-related content here. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden references or slang, but "Matter number 13" doesn't seem to be a slang term for drugs. The key is that the post is about a legal matter, not drug use. So the answer is F.
