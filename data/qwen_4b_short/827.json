Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Do you have the full judgement? If you do, please share it with me. ✨"

First, I need to check if this post relates to drug use. The rules state that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user is asking if someone has "the full judgement" and wants them to share it. The phrase "full judgement" isn't a slang term for drugs. The mention of "judgement" here seems metaphorical, perhaps referring to a legal judgment or a decision. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or related activities. The emoji ✨ is just a decorative symbol and doesn't indicate drug-related content. 

Since there's no direct reference to drugs or drug-related activities, and the phrase "full judgement" is not a slang term for drugs, this post doesn't fit the T category. Therefore, it should be labeled as F.
