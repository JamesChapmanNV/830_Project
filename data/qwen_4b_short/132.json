Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone who is a dealer at the WSOP 2021, winning a bracelet for $39,013.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "dealer" and "drug use." But wait, in this context, "dealer" might refer to a poker dealer, not a drug dealer. The event is a poker tournament, so the dealer here is probably a person who deals cards, not drugs. 

The post mentions "career-first #WSOP gold bracelet," which is related to poker. The amount $39,013 is the prize money. There's no mention of drugs, slang, or any activity related to drug use. The term "dealer" could be confusing, but in a poker context, it's not related to drugs. 

So according to the rules, T is for drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Since there's no indication of drug-related activities here, it's F. The post is about a poker tournament and prize money, so it's a factual statement about a poker event. Therefore, the label should be F.
