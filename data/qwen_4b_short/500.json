Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Xs family said it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine why are people still saying it's an overdose???" 

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The user mentions a family's reaction to the COVID vaccine and people still referring to it as an overdose. The key here is to determine if the post is discussing drug use, abuse, or related terms.

Looking at the rules: T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

The post talks about a reaction to the COVID vaccine and confusion about whether it's an overdose. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any slang related to drugs. The mention of "overdose" here is in the context of a vaccine reaction, which is a medical issue, not related to drug abuse. The user is questioning why people still call it an overdose, which seems to be a misunderstanding or a mix-up between vaccine side effects and drug overdoses.

So, the post is discussing a medical reaction to a vaccine, not drug use. There's no indication of drug abuse, trafficking, or related terms. The "overdose" here is a metaphor or a misinterpretation, not a reference to drug use. Therefore, the label should be F.
