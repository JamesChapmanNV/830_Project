Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a legal case where a law firm is filing a motion to disqualify another law firm. The hashtags are #cannabiscommunity, #marijuana, #cannabis. The content mentions Markowitz Herbold PC vs. Susman Godfrey LLP.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The main topic here is a legal dispute between law firms. The hashtags are related to cannabis, but the content is about a business or legal matter, not about using, seeking, buying, selling drugs, or slang. The mention of cannabis is in the context of a legal case, not drug use. There's no mention of anyone using drugs, selling them, or any slang terms. The legal action is about disqualifying a law firm, which is a business issue. So, according to the rules, this doesn't fit the T category. Therefore, the label should be F.
