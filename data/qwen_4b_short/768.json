Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about the NABP PMP InterConnect network, which allows state PDMPs to exchange controlled substance Rx data to lower overdose deaths from the opioid epidemic.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "controlled substance Rx data" and "opiate epidemic." The post is talking about a system that helps track and manage prescriptions to combat overdoses. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Instead, it's about a medical or policy-related initiative to address the epidemic through data sharing. 

The label rules say T is for drug use related terms, and F is for other cases like medical discussions or policy. Since the post is explaining a program aimed at reducing overdoses by managing prescriptions, it's a medical/policy discussion. Therefore, the correct label should be F.
