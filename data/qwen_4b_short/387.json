Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about comparing narcotics like oxycodone and morphine to marijuana, mentioning that marijuana can help others even though the person hasn't smoked it.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The mention of narcotics like oxycodone and morphine are definitely illicit drugs. However, the post is comparing them to marijuana. The user says they've never smoked but know marijuana can help others. 

The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. The user is talking about the dangers of narcotics and questioning why marijuana isn't considered as dangerous. But they don't explicitly state they are using or advocating for the use of any drugs. They're making a comparison, not necessarily promoting use. 

The rules say T if it shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post doesn't mention using, but it does mention marijuana, which is a drug. However, the context is a comparison, not a direct statement of use. The user is discussing the potential benefits of marijuana, but not necessarily endorsing its use. 

Wait, but the question is whether the text shows drug use. The mention of marijuana is a drug, but the user hasn't used it. They're talking about its potential benefits. So maybe it's not T because they aren't using it. The post is more about discussing the risks and benefits, not actual use. 

But the rules also include "slang for drugs." The post doesn't use slang, just mentions the names of drugs. So the label would be F because it's a discussion about drugs, not showing use. The user is not using, seeking, buying, etc. They're just comparing the dangers. So the answer should be F.
