Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is a series of hearts with "heroin" in the middle. The rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to check if the post directly mentions drug use. The text includes "heroin," which is a specific illicit drug. The hearts are probably just decorative, but the presence of "heroin" in the middle is key. Even if it's in a creative or artistic way, the word itself is a direct reference to a drug. So according to the rules, that should be T. The other parts are just heart symbols, so they don't add any context. The post isn't discussing medical use, policy, news, or discouraging use. It's just showing the drug name. So the label should be T.
