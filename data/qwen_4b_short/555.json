Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "" just get me some fuckin' morphine doc before I rip out your other eye. ""

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "morphine," which is a controlled substance, and the context of the user demanding it. The phrase "fuckin' morphine" is pretty explicit. Also, the threat of "ripping out your other eye" might be a metaphor, but the main focus is on the drug request.

Looking at the label rules: T is for any text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post clearly mentions morphine, which is a drug. The user is asking for it, which falls under seeking. The threat might be a separate issue, but the main point here is the request for morphine. Even though there's a threat, the primary action is seeking a drug. So according to the rules, this should be labeled T. The other part about the eye is a threat, but the main drug-related term is morphine. So the answer should be T.
