Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is "They won't take a QB at 6". The rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to parse the sentence. "They won't take a QB at 6". QB stands for Quarterback, which is a position in American football. The phrase "take a QB" might be a metaphor or slang. But wait, in football terms, "taking a QB" could mean selecting a quarterback in a draft, but the "at 6" part is confusing. Maybe "at 6" refers to the 6th round in the draft? So the sentence is about a football draft, where they aren't taking a quarterback in the 6th round. 

Now, checking if there's any drug-related terminology here. The words "QB" is an acronym for football, not drugs. The numbers "6" could be a round number, but not related to drugs. There's no mention of drugs, slang, or any related terms. The sentence is about sports, specifically football drafts. 

So according to the rules, since there's no mention of drugs or related terms, the label should be F. The user is testing if I can distinguish between sports jargon and drug-related terms. The answer is F.
