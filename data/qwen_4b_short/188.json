Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The post is about DoorDash considering expanding into cannabis delivery. The user wants to know if this is a T (text shows drug use) or F (other cases).

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use. The key terms here are "cannabis." Cannabis is a drug, but the context is about a company expanding delivery services. The post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. It's talking about a business decision, not actual drug use. 

The label rules say T is for any mention of drug use activities. Since the post is about a company's potential expansion into a market (cannabis delivery), it's more of a business news or policy discussion. There's no indication of someone using drugs, seeking them, or engaging in related activities. 

So, the correct label should be F because it's not about drug use but rather a business move. The mention of cannabis is part of the industry, not the use of the drug itself. Therefore, it's an F.
