Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about DMX being in the ICU after a heart attack, with early reports mentioning an overdose, and the person recalls listening to his music before sports events.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key part here is "early reports said over dose." Overdose is directly related to drug use. DMX is a rapper, so his music might involve drug references, but the post specifically mentions an overdose in the context of his hospitalization. The user is talking about his medical condition, but the mention of overdose is a direct indicator of drug use. The other parts about listening to his music before matches aren't relevant to the drug use aspect. So, the main point here is the overdose, which falls under T. The rest is about his health, but the overdose is the key factor. Therefore, the label should be T.
