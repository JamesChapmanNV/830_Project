Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about scientists with NASA's MMS Mission solving a 60-year mystery related to fast magnetic explosions.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The keywords to look for are using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about a scientific discovery related to magnetic explosions, which is a space-related topic. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any related terms. The subject is entirely about a scientific achievement, not related to drug abuse. 

Since the post is about a medical or policy discussion, news, or discouraging use, but in this case, it's just reporting a scientific breakthrough. There's no indication of drug use or related activities. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F.
