Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is "Caddy shack >mr bean but do go on". First, I need to understand what the post is saying.

"Caddy Shack" is a movie title, right? It's a comedy about a caddy and his interactions with a golfer. "Mr. Bean" is another TV show, a comedy series. The user is comparing these two, saying "Caddy Shack > Mr. Bean but do go on". The phrase "do go on" is a bit unclear. Maybe they're saying "do go on" as in "keep going" or "continue"? But in the context of the comparison between the two shows, it might be a way of saying that even though Caddy Shack is better than Mr. Bean, they should still go on with something else? Or maybe it's a typo or a misphrased sentence.

Now, the label rules: T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

Looking at the post, there's no mention of drugs, drug use, slang, or any related terms. The post is just comparing two TV shows. The phrase "do go on" might be a metaphor, but it's not related to drugs. The user is not discussing drug abuse, medical issues, policy, news, or discouraging use. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F. There's no indication of drug-related content here. The comparison between movies is just a general statement without any drug references. Therefore, the correct label is F.
