Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Heroin. It almost killed me once - motherfucker won't get me again! ðŸ˜¬"

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The word "Heroin" is definitely a drug, and the user mentions it almost killed them, which indicates they've used it. The phrase "won't get me again" might be a metaphor, but the context here is about past use leading to a near-death experience. The exclamation "motherfucker" is a strong expression, but the main point is about heroin use. Since the post directly mentions heroin and the consequences of its use, it fits the T category. The emoji is just an expression, not relevant to the label. So the answer should be T.
