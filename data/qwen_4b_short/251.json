Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is about a Cowboys player, Rolando McClain, getting a 10-game suspension for drinking "purple drank," which is a mix of cough syrup and codeine. The label rules are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, and F for other cases.

First, I need to determine if the post falls under T or F. The key here is to check if the content directly mentions drug use. The post specifically mentions "purple drank," which is a slang term for a drug mixture. The components listed are cough syrup and codeine, both of which are associated with illicit drug use. The suspension is due to using this substance, which is a clear case of drug use. 

The label rules state that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since "purple drank" is a slang term for a drug, and the post is reporting on the suspension related to its consumption, this should be labeled T. The post is not about medical discussion or policy; it's about the actual use of a drug. Therefore, the correct label is T.
