Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "bruh does no one notice this guy is wearing a tie dye codeine shirt?" The options are T or F. 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

The post mentions "codeine shirt." Codeine is a opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug. But wait, is codeine considered slang here? Or is it a reference to something else? The phrase "codeine shirt" might be a metaphor. But codeine is a drug, so if someone is wearing a shirt that's a slang reference, that could be T. However, sometimes people use codeine in a non-drug context, like a brand name or a reference to a song. But in this case, the person is asking if someone is wearing a shirt that's "tie dye codeine." 

Wait, "codeine shirt" could be a metaphor for something else. But codeine is a drug, so if the shirt is a reference to codeine, that might be T. But maybe the user is just referring to a shirt with codeine printed on it, not necessarily implying drug use. However, the label rules include slang for drugs. So if "codeine" is being used as slang, then it's T. But codeine is a drug, so even if it's a shirt, the mention of codeine could be considered as showing drug use. Alternatively, maybe the person is just referring to a shirt with codeine on it as a fashion statement, not implying drug use. But according to the rules, if the text shows drug use, even in a metaphorical way, it's T. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using "codeine" as a brand name or something else. But codeine is a drug. So the mention of codeine in the shirt could be considered as T. Therefore, the label would be T. But I need to be careful. The key is whether the text shows drug use. If the shirt is a codeine shirt, that's a reference to the drug. So the answer is T.
