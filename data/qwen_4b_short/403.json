Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about pharmacy shortages and drugs, specifically mentioning Morphine PF and diamorphine. 

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "diamorphine," which is a slang term for heroin. The user is talking about shortages of diamorphine, which is an illegal drug. They also mention Morphine PF, which is a form of morphine, but the context here is about drug shortages and availability.

The rules state that T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post doesn't explicitly state that someone is using or seeking the drugs, but it's discussing the availability and challenges of getting diamorphine, which is a controlled substance. Since diamorphine is a slang term for heroin, this would fall under T because it's referring to an illicit drug. 

However, the user is talking about pharmacy shortages and medical contexts. But the mention of diamorphine as a drug that's been in and out of supply for a long time, and the fact that it's a controlled substance, makes it clear that this is related to illicit drug use. The post is discussing the availability of a drug that's associated with drug abuse. 

So, even though the post is about shortages and medical aspects, the mention of diamorphine (heroin) as a drug that's been in and out of supply would trigger the T label. The key is whether the text shows drug use. Since diamorphine is a slang term for heroin, which is an illicit drug, this should be labeled T.
