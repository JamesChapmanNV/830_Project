Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on whether it mentions drug use. The post is from someone talking about their ex-husband, a general surgeon, explaining that morphine titrated for pain, even if self-administered, and then withdrawn to non-opioids once healing began rarely leads to addiction.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are morphine, which is an opioid, and the context is surgical use. The person is discussing medical use under the supervision of a surgeon. The post mentions titration and withdrawal, which are medical procedures. The user is talking about the medical aspect, not personal use or abuse. There's no mention of seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The focus is on medical treatment and the outcome (rare addiction). So, this seems like a medical discussion. Therefore, the label should be F, as it's not about illicit drug use but medical use. The answer is F.
