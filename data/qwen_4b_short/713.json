Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "my drafts are so fucking funny i crack myself tf UP".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key parts are "fucking funny" and "crack myself tf UP". The word "crack" here might be a slang term. Wait, "crack" can refer to the drug crack, which is a form of cocaine. But in this context, the person says "crack myself tf UP", which could be a metaphor for laughing so hard they're cracking up. However, the use of "crack" in the phrase "crack myself up" is a common idiom meaning to laugh until you cry. But the user might be using "crack" as a slang for the drug. 

But the original post says "crack myself tf UP". The "tf UP" is probably a typo or slang for "fucking up". So the main phrase is "crack myself up", which is a common expression. However, the presence of "crack" might be confusing. But in standard usage, "crack up" is a metaphor. However, if someone is using "crack" as a slang for the drug, then it would be T. But the context here is the person is laughing so hard they're cracking up, which is a metaphor. 

But wait, the user is a moderator for drug abuse, so they need to be careful. The phrase "crack myself up" is definitely a metaphor. However, the use of "crack" could be a slang for the drug. But in this case, the person is talking about laughing, not using drugs. The "tf UP" is probably a typo for "fucking up", so the main point is the metaphor. 

But the problem is that "crack" can be a drug. So is this a case of using the slang for drugs? The user might be using "crack" as a slang for the drug. However, the context is that the person is laughing so hard they're cracking up. So the intended meaning is the metaphor. But the presence of "crack" could be a red flag. 

But according to the rules, if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, then it's T. If it's a metaphor, then F. The key is whether "crack" here is a slang for drugs or a metaphor. In this case, the user is using "crack myself up" as a metaphor for laughing. However, the presence of "crack" might be a slang for the drug. But the context is the person is laughing, not using drugs. 

So the answer would be F, because it's a metaphor. Unless the user is using "crack" as a slang for the drug. But in this case, the person is talking about laughing, so it's more likely a metaphor. Therefore, the label is F.
