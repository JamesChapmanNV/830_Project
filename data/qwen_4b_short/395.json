Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is in Hindi, so I need to understand it first. Let me translate it to make sure I get the context right.

The post says: "Thanks Geet I'm fine now kal overdose ho gya tha bs isliye...or kuch cheeze effect kr ri thi mujhe now I'm fine...n thanku jo vi tumne kaha M yd rakhunga n isliye tumse hi suru kr rha hu if achha lage to accept kr lenga friend ü§ù"

Translating that, it seems like the person is thanking Geet and saying they're fine now. They mention that yesterday they had an overdose (kal overdose ho gya tha), and some things were affecting them, but now they're okay. They also mention remembering what the person said and will keep it in mind, starting from them, and if it's good, they'll accept the friendship.

Now, applying the label rules. The T label is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The F label is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

The key part here is "kal overdose ho gya tha" which translates to "yesterday I had an overdose." Overdose is a clear indication of drug use, specifically mentioning an overdose, which is a direct reference to illicit drug use. The person is talking about an overdose they experienced, which falls under the T category. The rest of the post is about gratitude and starting a friendship, but the mention of overdose is the critical factor here.

I need to make sure there's no other possible interpretation. The user might be referring to a medical overdose, but the context of the post is about drug use. The term "overdose" in this context is strongly associated with drug abuse. Therefore, the label should be T.
