Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Over here in the ER high asf off of morphine.... ðŸ˜Š"

First, I need to understand what the rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post mentions "high asf off of morphine." Let's break this down. "High" is a common slang term for being under the influence of drugs. "Asf" is likely a typo for "as fuck," which is a slang expression, but in this context, it's part of "high asf," which might be a way of saying "high as fuck," meaning extremely high. However, the key part here is "off of morphine." Morphine is a powerful opioid, typically used medically for pain relief. But in this context, the person is in the ER and says they're "high off of morphine," which could imply that they're using it for recreational purposes or perhaps experiencing the effects of the drug.

Now, considering the rules: if the text shows drug use, even if it's in a medical context, but here the person is in the ER, so maybe they're talking about the effects of morphine, which is a controlled substance. However, the use of "high" and "asf" might be indicating that they're using the drug, which is considered illicit or abusive. But wait, morphine is a prescription drug, so using it without a prescription is illegal. The post is from someone in the ER, so maybe they're discussing the effects of morphine, which is a medical use, but the way it's phrased could be seen as using it for recreational purposes. Alternatively, it could be a metaphor, but the mention of "high" and "asf" suggests a slang term. 

But the label rules specify that T includes slang for drugs. So "high" is a slang term for drug use, and "morphine" is a drug. The person is in the ER, but the key is whether the text shows drug use. Since they're saying they're "high off of morphine," that could be indicating that they're using the drug, which would be T. However, if they're in the ER, maybe they're talking about the medical use of morphine, but the phrasing "high asf off of morphine" seems more like a slang expression. The "asf" is a slang term, but it's part of "high asf," which might be a way of saying "high as fuck," which is a strong expression. 

Alternatively, "high asf" could be a typo for "high as f," but that doesn't make sense. The correct term would be "as fuck," so "high as fuck" is a common slang term for being very high. So the person is saying they're high from morphine, which is a drug. Since morphine is a controlled substance, and the person is using it in a way that's indicating they're high, this would be T. 

But wait, the person is in the ER. Maybe they're talking about the medical use of morphine, but the way it's phrased is more like a slang expression. The key is whether the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. If they're using morphine in a medical setting, it's not considered illicit, but the use of "high" and "asf" might indicate that they're using it recreationally. However, the ER is a medical setting, so maybe they're discussing the effects of the drug. 

But the label rules include "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the text is using slang for drugs, then it's T. "High" is slang for drug use, and "morphine" is a drug. Therefore, the label would be T. However, if the person is in the ER and talking about the medical use of morphine, then it's F. But the phrasing "high asf off of morphine" suggests that they're using it, not just receiving it. So the answer is T.
