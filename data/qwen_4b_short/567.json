Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "It's kind of insane that Switzerland's medical cannabis program is more stringent than UTAH." The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, or F for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to determine if the post is about drug use. The mention of Switzerland's medical cannabis program and Utah's comparison. Medical cannabis is a controlled substance, but it's used medically. The post is talking about the strictness of the programs, not about using drugs. It's a comparison between two places' regulations. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post is more about policy or regulation. So, the label should be F. The user is discussing medical cannabis programs, which is a policy or medical discussion, not about illicit drug use. Therefore, the answer is F.
