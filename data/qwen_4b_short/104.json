Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says, "I just read somebody post said DMX didn't overdose it was the covid vaccine." The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, or F for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to determine if the post is about drug use. The mention of DMX, a rapper, and the claim that he didn't overdose but rather the COVID vaccine caused it. The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. The user is talking about a possible cause of death (overdose) but attributes it to the vaccine instead of drugs. 

The post is discussing a medical or health-related topic, specifically the cause of DMX's death. The user is sharing information about a possible link between the vaccine and his death, which is a medical/health discussion. There's no explicit mention of drugs, slang, or any direct reference to drug use. It's more about a medical claim or conspiracy theory, which falls under F. 

I should check if there's any slang or hidden reference to drugs. The term "overdose" is used, but in this context, it's about the vaccine, not drugs. The post is not about using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking drugs. Therefore, the label should be F.
