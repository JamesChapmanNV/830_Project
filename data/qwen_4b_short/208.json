Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a forensic pathologist ruling out drug overdose as the cause of death for George Floyd. The pathologist mentioned that based on videos and knowledge of fentanyl deaths, it was "totally different than what is seen in Mr. Floyd."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for mentions of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about fentanyl, which is a drug. However, the pathologist is discussing the cause of death and comparing it to fentanyl deaths. The main point is that they ruled out drug overdose, but the mention of fentanyl is a specific drug. However, the post doesn't mention any actual use, seeking, buying, or trafficking. It's more about the forensic analysis and the comparison to fentanyl cases. The term "fentanyl" is a drug, but the context is about the cause of death being ruled out, not the act of using or dealing drugs. So, the label here would be F because it's a medical or policy discussion about the cause of death, not directly about drug use. The mention of fentanyl is part of the analysis, not the act of using it. Therefore, the correct label is F.
