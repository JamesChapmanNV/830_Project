Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Yeah fat Albert a.k.a. river and Al Sharpton the Coke dealer!!!"

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key part is "Al Sharpton the Coke dealer". Al Sharpton is a public figure, but here he's being referred to as a "Coke dealer". The term "Coke dealer" directly relates to selling cocaine, which is an illicit drug. The mention of selling (dealer) fits under the T category. 

I should also check if there's any other slang or terms for drugs. "Coke" is a slang term for cocaine, which is an illicit drug. The person is being called a dealer, which implies selling. So this clearly falls under T. 

The other part of the post is "fat Albert a.k.a. river". That seems like a nickname or a reference to a person, but doesn't relate to drug use. The main point is the mention of Al Sharpton as a Coke dealer. 

So the label should be T because it's about selling cocaine, which is illicit drug use.
