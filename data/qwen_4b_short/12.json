Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is about Long Covid symptoms and using AI on patient data. The label rules are T if it's about drug use, and F otherwise.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drugs, drug use, or related terms. The post talks about Long Covid, which is a condition related to COVID-19, and AI being used to study patient data. The words here are "Long Covid," "symptoms," "study," "AI," "patient data." There's no mention of drugs, drug use, buying, selling, or slang. The question is about using AI to analyze data, which is a medical or research topic. The term "unleashing AI" is a metaphor here, not referring to any drug. So, according to the rules, this doesn't fit T. Therefore, the label should be F.
