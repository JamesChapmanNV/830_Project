Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about New York's cannabis industry and events in Rochester for 4/20. The key here is to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs.

The post talks about the cannabis industry, which is legal in New York now. It mentions events celebrating the holiday, which is April 20th, a day associated with cannabis. The words used are "cannabis industry," "events," and "celebrate the holiday." There's no mention of drug use, abuse, or slang. The focus is on the industry and events, not on drug use. So according to the rules, since there's no indication of drug use or abuse, it should be labeled F. The answer is F.
