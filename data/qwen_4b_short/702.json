Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "All this codeine got me nodding off yo bitch at the crib nodding off".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "codeine" and "nodding off". Codeine is a controlled substance, typically used in medication, but in this context, it's likely referring to its use as a drug. The phrase "nodding off" is a slang term for falling asleep, which can be a side effect of drug use. 

The user mentioned that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. "Codeine" is a drug, and "nodding off" is a slang term related to the effects of drug use. The phrase "yo bitch at the crib" might be a colloquial expression, but the main point is the mention of codeine leading to nodding off. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that would make this F. The post is clearly discussing the use of codeine and its effect, which fits under T. There's no mention of medical use or policy discussion here. The person is talking about using codeine and the result, which is a direct indication of drug use. 

So the label should be T.
