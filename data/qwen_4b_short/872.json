Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Dude really told me my bumper fell off my car as soon as I pulled out of car dealer so I pulled over and it was still on they just wanted to pass me on the road."

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, the main content is about a car bumper falling off. The person mentions a car dealer and pulling over. There's no mention of drugs, drug-related activities, slang, or any terms associated with drug use. The only thing here is a car-related incident. The phrase "Dude really told me" might be a bit informal, but it's not related to drugs. The person is talking about a situation where someone tried to pass them on the road, but that's a traffic-related issue, not drug-related.

I don't see any keywords that would trigger the T label. The post is about a car problem, not drug use. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F.
