Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "When the nurse asked me if I wanted the morphine it was as much as I could do to squeak 'yes please'... utter agony."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about receiving morphine. Morphine is a prescription opioid, typically used for pain management. The context here is a medical situation where the nurse is administering it. The person is in agony and can barely say "yes please." 

Now, the key is whether this is considered drug use. Morphine is a controlled substance, but in a medical context, it's prescribed for pain relief. The post doesn't mention using drugs recreationally or illegally. It's about a medical treatment. The person is not seeking or using drugs for non-medical purposes. The mention of "morphine" is part of a medical scenario, not slang or abuse. 

The phrase "utter agony" might be a metaphor, but in this context, it's describing the physical pain from a medical condition, not drug use. There's no indication of drug seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. The person is receiving medication as part of treatment. 

So, according to the rules, since it's a medical discussion about a prescribed drug, the label should be F. The post isn't showing illicit or abusive drug use but rather a medical situation. Therefore, the answer is F.
