Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about the trail, Dr. Bradford Lagenfeld, and George Floyd's death. The key part is that the doctor said he died from asphyxia, not a drug overdose.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use. The post states that the cause of death was asphyxia, not a drug overdose. So, there's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The focus is on the cause of death being asphyxia, which is a medical term. The mention of a physician and the official cause of death is factual. Since there's no indication of drug abuse or related activities, the label should be F. The user is asking for only T or F, so I need to make sure I don't add any extra text. The answer is F.
