Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Actiq, the fentalyl lollipop was clearly developed with rappers in mind."

First, I need to understand what the label rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

So the post mentions "Actiq" and "fentalyl lollipop." I know that Fentanyl is a powerful opioid, and Actiq is a brand name for a fentanyl product used for pain management. The term "lollipop" is a slang term for fentanyl, which is a drug. The post is saying that this product was developed for rappers. 

Now, the question is whether this post falls under T or F. The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. The mention of "fentanyl lollipop" is a slang term for the drug, which is illicit. Even though the post is making a comment about the product being designed for rappers, the mention of the drug itself is a direct reference to an illicit drug. 

But wait, the post is talking about the product's development. However, the term "fentanyl lollipop" is a slang for the drug, so it's indicating that the drug is being used. Even if the context is about the product's target audience, the presence of the drug's name and slang term would still fall under T. 

Alternatively, if the post was discussing the medical use of Actiq, that would be F. But since it's referring to the drug's form (lollipop) and the target audience (rappers), which is a slang term, it's still about the drug's use. Therefore, the label should be T.
