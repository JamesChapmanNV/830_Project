Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on whether it shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post here is about streaming an NBA game between the Memphis Grizzlies and Minnesota Timberwolves. The user provided a link in the tweet and some hashtags.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs, drug use, slang, or related terms. The post talks about watching a basketball game, streaming it, and includes hashtags related to the NBA playoffs. The only thing that might be a bit tricky is the word "CLICK" followed by "====v". But that's probably just a formatting thing or a link to the stream. 

Looking at the label rules again: T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. 

The post doesn't mention any drugs. The hashtags are about sports, and the link is for a sports event. The "CLICK" might be part of a link, but there's no drug-related content here. So I don't see any T indicators. The answer should be F.
