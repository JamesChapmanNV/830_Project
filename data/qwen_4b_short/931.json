Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Oh damn man. I was being super serious." 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the user says "Oh damn man. I was being super serious." There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any related terms. The phrase "being super serious" could be a metaphor, but without any context that points to drug use, it's hard to see how this would fit under T. 

I should check if there's any slang or hidden meaning. "Super serious" might be a way to express something intense, but not related to drugs. The user might be talking about a serious situation in general. Since there's no direct reference to drugs or drug-related activities, this doesn't meet the criteria for T. 

Therefore, the label should be F because it's not related to drug use and doesn't fit the T criteria. The post is just a statement about being serious, which is a general expression and not related to illicit drugs.
