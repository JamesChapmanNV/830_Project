Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about the Narcotics Control Bureau seizing drugs. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post mentions "high-quality" heroin and other suspected drugs. The words "heroin" and "drugs" are definitely related to drug use. Even though it's talking about a seizure by authorities, the presence of specific drug names like heroin and the mention of drugs in general would fall under T. The hashtags #DRUGS and #drugsareforbidden also reinforce that. Since the post is reporting on drug seizures, it's not a metaphor or a medical discussion. So the label should be T.
