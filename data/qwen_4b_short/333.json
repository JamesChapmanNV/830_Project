Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "The International Cannabis Conversation - NEW SHOW - The International Cannabis Conversation is live on".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post is about a new show titled "The International Cannabis Conversation". The title itself includes "Cannabis", which is a drug. However, the context here is about a show or a discussion, not necessarily about using or selling drugs. The phrase "NEW SHOW" suggests it's a media event, possibly a podcast or a broadcast discussing cannabis. 

Now, I need to determine if this is T or F. The key is whether the post is about drug use. Since the show's name is about cannabis, but the post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang. It's more about a new show that's live, so it's a news or event announcement. 

The rules say F includes news, so if the post is announcing a new show, that's F. Unless the show is about drug use, but the title is just "The International Cannabis Conversation", which could be a discussion about cannabis in a legal or medical context. However, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the show is about cannabis, which is a drug, but the post itself doesn't mention use. 

Wait, the label T is for text that shows drug use. The post here is just announcing a show. So unless the show is about using drugs, which isn't stated here. The post is just a title and a new show. So the answer should be F because it's not about drug use but about a news event. Therefore, the label is F.
