Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "He didn't overdose you bitch, his family confirmed that already."

First, I need to check if this post relates to drug use. The key terms here are "overdose" and "family confirmed." The word "overdose" is directly related to drug abuse, as it's a consequence of using drugs. However, the context here is someone saying that the person didn't overdose, and the family confirmed it. 

But wait, the label rules say T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So even if the post is about an overdose, which is a result of drug use, does that count as T? The rule says "shows illicit or abusive drug use," so if the post is discussing an overdose, which is a result of drug use, then it might be T. However, the post is not explicitly stating that someone is using drugs, but rather talking about an overdose. 

But the label F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor. So if the post is about an overdose, which is a medical situation, maybe it's F? Wait, but the overdose itself is a consequence of drug use. So maybe it's T. But the post isn't necessarily stating that the person is using drugs, but rather that they didn't overdose. The family confirmed it. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is in a context where someone is discussing a drug-related incident, so even if it's about an overdose, which is a result of drug use, the label would be T. But I need to check the exact rules again. The T label includes any text that shows drug use, including the act of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Overdose is a result of drug use, but is it considered showing drug use? 

Alternatively, if the post is about an overdose, which is a medical situation, maybe it's F. But the problem is that the post is not about the use of drugs, but about a confirmation of no overdose. However, the mention of "overdose" is a term related to drug use. So maybe it's T. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is not directly about drug use but about a medical event. But the term "overdose" is a slang for drug overdose, so that would be T. Therefore, the label should be T. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The post is not explicitly stating that someone is using drugs, but the mention of overdose is a result of drug use. However, the label rules might consider the presence of the term "overdose" as part of drug use. So the answer would be T. 

Wait, but the label F includes medical discussion. So if the post is about a medical situation, like an overdose, then maybe it's F. But the problem is that the term "overdose" is a slang for drug use. So maybe it's T. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is not about drug use but about a medical confirmation. For example, if someone is saying that the person didn't overdose, which could be a medical situation, but the term "overdose" is part of the drug use context. 

I think the correct answer here is T because the term "overdose" is directly related to drug use, even if the post is about confirming that there was no overdose. The presence of the term "overdose" would trigger the T label. Therefore, the label should be T.
