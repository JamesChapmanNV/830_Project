Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Codeine crazy, codeine crazy All this motherfucking money got me going codeine crazy".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The word "codeine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. The phrase "codeine crazy" is likely a slang term or a way of expressing that the person is using codeine. The mention of "motherfucking money" might indicate that they're using money to get the drug, which could relate to buying or trafficking. 

But wait, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so even if it's slang, if it's related to using the drug, it's T. The repetition of "codeine crazy" suggests that the person is under the influence or using the drug. The phrase "got me going codeine crazy" implies that the money is being used to obtain codeine, which is a form of buying. So, this would fall under T because it's about using and possibly purchasing the drug. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphorical use here. The context seems to be about using codeine, which is a controlled substance. The mention of money could be related to buying it. So, the label should be T.
