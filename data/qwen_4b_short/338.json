Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Source? Cuz everything I read says he had a heart attack because of an overdose. Which means the overdose killed him". 

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The person is talking about someone who had a heart attack due to an overdose, and they're saying that the overdose caused his death. The key here is whether this post is indicating drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs.

The post mentions an overdose, which is directly related to drug use. An overdose implies that the person was using drugs, and the overdose led to a heart attack and death. The term "overdose" is a direct indicator of drug use. Even though the post is discussing a cause of death, the mention of overdose is a clear sign of illicit drug use. 

The label rules state that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use. Since the post is talking about an overdose, which is a result of drug use, this should be labeled T. The other cases (F) would be things like medical discussions, news, or discouraging use, but this is more about the consequences of drug use. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphorical use here. The person is not using "overdose" in a non-literal sense. They are talking about a real event where an overdose caused a heart attack and death. Therefore, it's a clear case of T.
