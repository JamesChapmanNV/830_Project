Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Doc just prescribed morphine. Fingers crossed it does the trick. X"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "morphine." Morphine is a controlled substance, typically used for pain management, and it's a Schedule II drug in the US. But the question is whether it's considered illicit or abusive use.

The post mentions that the doctor prescribed morphine. The user is expressing hope that it works. Now, the rules say T if the text shows use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

But here, the person is not using morphine themselves. They're talking about being prescribed it by a doctor. Morphine is a prescription medication, so it's a medical use. However, the question is about whether the text shows drug use. Since the person is not using it themselves but rather receiving it from a doctor, maybe it's not T. 

But wait, the rules also include "seeking" or "buying." But in this case, the person isn't seeking or buying. They are getting it prescribed. So maybe it's F. However, sometimes people might use terms like "prescribed" as part of the drug use. But the rules specify that T is when the text shows the act of using, seeking, buying, etc. 

Alternatively, if the person is using morphine, but in this case, they're not using it. They're receiving it. So the label would be F. Unless "prescribed" is considered part of the drug use. But the rules don't mention prescription as a factor. The key is whether the text shows the act of using, seeking, etc. 

So the answer is F because it's a medical prescription, not illicit use. The person is not using the drug themselves, but receiving it from a doctor. Therefore, it's not T. The label should be F.
