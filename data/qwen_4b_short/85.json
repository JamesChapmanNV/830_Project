Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a young couple buying a crack house in the slums for $100k over asking price.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "crack house." A crack house is a place where drugs are sold or used, so that's a strong indicator. The couple is buying it, which implies they're involved in drug trafficking or selling. The mention of "crack" specifically refers to the drug, which is illicit. 

The label rules say T if there's use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, buying a crack house directly relates to drug trafficking or selling. Even though the main action is buying a house, the context of crack house makes it clear. So the label should be T. 

I should make sure there's no other context that might make it F, like a metaphor or medical discussion. But "crack house" is a slang term for a place where drugs are sold. So it's definitely T.
