Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a comedian, Nikki Glaser, and her new show on ABC 1-on-1 audio. The key here is to check if the text mentions anything related to illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if there's text showing use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post: "Comedian Nikki Glaser takes a crack at reality TV in her new show, Welcome Home Nikki Glaser? -- with ABC 1-on-1 audio". There's no mention of drugs here. The topic is about a comedy show and reality TV. Words like "comedian," "show," "reality TV," "ABC 1-on-1 audio" are all related to entertainment or media. No slang, no mention of drug use, buying, selling, etc. So according to the rules, this should be F. The label is F.
