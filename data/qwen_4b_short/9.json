Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about overdose numbers and mentions that people can overdose again and again. The rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to check if the post contains any direct references to drug use. The post talks about overdoses, which is a consequence of drug use, but does it explicitly mention drugs? The wording is "overdose" and "same people to overdose again and again." The term "overdose" itself is a result of drug use, but the post doesn't specify which drugs. However, in the context of drug abuse, overdoses are typically related to illicit drugs. 

But according to the label rules, T is when the text shows drug use. The post doesn't mention any specific drugs or activities like using, seeking, buying, etc. It's more about the statistics of overdoses. The mention of overdoses is a consequence, not the act of using drugs. So maybe this is more of a F because it's discussing the impact of drug use rather than the use itself. However, some might argue that discussing overdoses is related to drug abuse. But the rules specify that T is when the text shows the act of using or related activities. Since the post doesn't mention the actual use, just the outcome (overdose), it might be F. 

Wait, but the label rules include "slang for drugs" as part of T. The post doesn't use any slang. It's just talking about overdoses. So the answer would be F because it's discussing the statistics and consequences, not the act of using drugs. The key is whether the text directly shows the use or related activities. Since it's about the numbers of overdoses, which is a result, not the act itself, it's F.
