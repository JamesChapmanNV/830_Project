Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about Disney considering a role for someone, mentioning Tom Hardy possibly taking on the role. The user is talking about the age of the actor and the need for grit.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, abuse, slang, or related terms. The post doesn't mention any drugs. It's discussing an actor's suitability for a role, comparing Tom Hardy to someone else. The words used are about acting, age, and grit. There's no reference to drugs, drug use, buying, selling, or any slang related to drugs. 

The label rules say T if there's illicit or abusive drug use, otherwise F. Since the post is about a movie role and actor suitability, it's all other cases. So the label should be F.
