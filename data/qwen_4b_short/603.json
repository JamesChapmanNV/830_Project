Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Let's see now, one protestor died from a drug overdose, 2 from heart attacks, one was murdered by a policeman, and a policeman died of a state secret."

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for any mention of drugs, using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs.

Looking at the post: The first part says "one protestor died from a drug overdose." The word "drug" is explicitly mentioned here. An overdose is a direct indicator of drug use. So that's a clear T. The rest of the post talks about heart attacks, murder by a policeman, and a policeman dying from a state secret. None of those terms relate to drugs. The heart attacks could be related to other causes, but the mention of "drug overdose" is enough to trigger the T label. Even though there are other events mentioned, the presence of "drug overdose" makes the entire post fall under T. The other parts don't involve drug use, but since there's at least one instance of drug use mentioned, the label should be T. So the answer is T.
