Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a Kittery adult-use marijuana shop getting Planning Board approval at the Outlet Mall.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

The post mentions an adult-use marijuana shop receiving approval. The key here is whether this is about drug use or something else. The term "marijuana" is a drug, but the context is about a shop getting planning approval. So, this seems like a news or policy-related post. The shop is for adult-use, which is legal in some places, but the act of getting approval is part of a regulatory process. There's no mention of using, selling, or seeking drugs. It's more about a business opening and the approval process. Therefore, this doesn't fit the T category. The label should be F.
