Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "The BOTDF album is underrated. I actually like some of the remixes on there and Is it Scary, Ghosts & Morphine are üëåüèæ"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules specify that T is for text showing use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the mention of "BOTDF" ‚Äì I'm not sure what that stands for. Maybe it's a band or an album name? The user might be referring to a music album. Then there's "Is it Scary, Ghosts & Morphine" ‚Äì those could be song titles. The emojis are just thumbs up, which are neutral.

Wait, "Morphine" is a drug, right? Morphine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. But in the context of the post, it's part of a song title. The user is talking about liking the remixes and specific songs. The mention of "Morphine" here is part of the song title, not necessarily indicating that the person is using or discussing drug use. 

But the rules say if the text shows slang for drugs, that's T. However, "Morphine" is a real drug, but in this case, it's part of a song title. Unless the user is using it as slang, which I don't think is the case here. The post is about liking the album and specific tracks, not discussing drug use. 

The other parts of the post don't mention any drug-related activities. The user is talking about music, not using or discussing drugs. Therefore, the label should be F. 

Wait, but maybe "BOTDF" is an acronym that stands for something related to drugs? I'm not sure. But without more context, I can't assume that. The user is likely referring to a music album, and the mention of Morphine is part of the song title, not indicating drug use. So the answer is F.
