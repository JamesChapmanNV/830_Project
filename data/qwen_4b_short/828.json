Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "I bet it was Imitrex (unless they just gave you morphine). Yeah, migraines are the worst! I'm lucky that I hardly ever get them any more-- maybe once a year-- but when I was a teenager, once a month."

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the user mentions "Imitrex" and "morphine." Imitrex is a medication used for migraines, right? And morphine is an opioid, also used for pain, including migraines. But are these considered illicit or abusive drugs? Wait, Imitrex is a prescription medication, not an illicit drug. Morphine is a controlled substance, but it's a medication, not a slang term for drugs. The user is talking about migraines and medications used to treat them. The conversation is about medical treatment, not drug use or abuse. There's no mention of using drugs for pleasure, seeking them, buying, selling, or trafficking. The mention of Imitrex and morphine is in the context of medical treatment for migraines. So this would be a medical discussion, which falls under F. The user is not discussing drug abuse but rather medical conditions and treatments. Therefore, the label should be F.
