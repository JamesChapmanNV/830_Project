Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passe."

First, I need to understand what the rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about someone being a "junkie" and mentions heroin. The term "junkie" is a slang term for someone who uses drugs, so that's part of the T category. Also, heroin is an illicit drug, so mentioning it directly would fall under T. The phrase "so passe" is a bit of a metaphor, but the main point here is the mention of being a junkie and heroin, which are directly related to drug use. 

Wait, but is the post just talking about someone else being a junkie, or is the speaker using heroin? The post says "I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passe." The speaker is talking about the other person being a junkie, but the reason given is that heroin is passe. However, the mention of heroin itself is an illicit drug. Even if the speaker is not using it, the fact that they are talking about heroin in the context of someone being a junkie might still be considered T. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is using heroin as a metaphor. But the term "junkie" is a direct reference to drug use. So even if the person is not using heroin, the mention of heroin and the term junkie would still be under T. 

So the label here should be T because it's referring to drug use (junkie) and the drug heroin. The metaphor part might be there, but the key terms are "junkie" and "heroin," which are directly related to drug abuse. Therefore, the correct label is T.
