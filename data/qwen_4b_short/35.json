Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "going to do another itzy album review bc listening to them is like shooting up morphine". 

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

So the post is about an album review. The user says listening to the music is like shooting up morphine. Now, morphine is a drug, but here it's used as a metaphor. The person is comparing the music's effect to the intense, possibly addictive experience of morphine. But the key is whether this is a direct reference to drug use or a metaphor.

The phrase "shooting up morphine" is a common metaphor for something extremely pleasurable or addictive, often used in the context of music or other activities. However, the user is using it to describe the experience of listening to the album. The question is whether this is a direct reference to drug use (T) or a metaphor (F).

The rules mention that T includes slang for drugs. "Shooting up" can be slang for injecting drugs, but here it's used metaphorically. The main point is whether the text is showing drug use. Since the user is not actually using or referring to drug use but using a metaphor, it's more likely F. However, I need to check if "shooting up morphine" is considered a slang term for drug use. If it's a direct reference, then T. But in this context, it's a metaphor. So the label should be F. Wait, but the user is comparing listening to the music to a drug experience, which could be seen as a metaphor for the intense effect of the music. So maybe F. Alternatively, if the user is implying that the music is as addictive as morphine, which is a drug, but not directly using it. Therefore, it's a metaphor, so F. But I need to make sure. The rules say T includes slang for drugs. If "shooting up morphine" is considered slang, then T. But in this case, it's a metaphor. So the answer is F.
