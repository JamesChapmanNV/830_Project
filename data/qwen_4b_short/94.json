Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Lol you need to write a book beef. You crack me up. Are you feeling better. Any word from the vettyman?" 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let's break down the post word by word.

The first part is "Lol you need to write a book beef." "Beef" here is slang, but I need to check if it's related to drugs. Wait, "beef" can mean a conflict or argument, but in some contexts, it might be slang for drugs. However, I'm not sure. Let me think. In some contexts, "beef" can be a slang term for drugs, but I'm not certain. Maybe it's more likely to be a regular slang term for a conflict. 

Next, "You crack me up." That's just a casual expression, not related to drugs. "Are you feeling better." That's a question about someone's condition, possibly related to health, but not drugs. "Any word from the vettyman?" "Vettyman" is probably a typo for "vet" or "veteran," but maybe it's a slang term? Wait, "vet" could be short for "veteran," but not sure. Alternatively, could "vettyman" be a slang term for a drug dealer? Hmm, not sure. 

Wait, "vettyman" might be a misspelling of "vet" (short for veterinarian) or "vet" as in "vet" as in a person who deals with drugs? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, could it be a slang term for a drug user? Maybe not. 

Looking back, the main terms are "beef" and "vettyman." If "beef" is not related to drugs, and "vettyman" is not, then the post is F. But I need to be careful. Let me check if "beef" is a slang for drugs. In some contexts, "beef" can be slang for drugs, but I think more commonly it's used as a term for a conflict. For example, "I'm going to give you some beef" might mean to argue or have a conflict. 

So, the post is mostly casual conversation, no direct mention of drugs. The user is asking if the person is feeling better and if there's any news from the vettyman. So, no indication of drug use. Therefore, the label should be F.
