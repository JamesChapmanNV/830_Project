Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "honestly I haven't experimented enough with weed to know. I do know morphine gives me less trouble than codeine."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the user mentions "weed," which is slang for cannabis. But the key part here is "morphine gives me less trouble than codeine." Morphine and codeine are both opioids, which are controlled substances. The user is comparing their experiences with these drugs. 

Now, the question is whether this is T or F. The first part talks about weed, which is a drug. However, the user says they haven't experimented enough with weed, so maybe that's not a direct use. The second part is about morphine and codeine. The user is talking about their personal experience with these drugs, which are illicit drugs. But wait, morphine is a controlled substance, and codeine is also a controlled substance. However, the user is not necessarily using them in a way that's considered abusive. They are comparing their experience with these drugs, which could be a medical or personal discussion. 

But according to the rules, if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, it's T. However, the user isn't necessarily using them. They are discussing their experience with these drugs, which might be a medical discussion. But the mention of morphine and codeine could be considered as referring to drug use. However, the user is not explicitly stating that they are using them. They are comparing the two, which might be a metaphor or a personal opinion. 

Wait, the user says "morphine gives me less trouble than codeine." That could be a metaphor, but it's more likely a personal experience. However, since morphine and codeine are both drugs, and the user is talking about their effects, this might be considered as discussing drug use, which could fall under T. But the rules specify that T is when the text shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. 

In this case, the user is not necessarily using the drugs. They are comparing their experience with them. So maybe this is a medical discussion. But the mention of morphine and codeine is a direct reference to drugs. However, the user is not using them, but discussing their effects. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to using these drugs, but the statement is more about their effects rather than their use. The first part is about weed, which is a drug. So the post mentions two drugs: weed and morphine/codeine. 

But the label rules are about showing drug use. If the user is talking about using morphine and codeine, then that would be T. But the user says "I do know morphine gives me less trouble than codeine." This could be a metaphor, but it's more likely a personal experience. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is discussing the effects of these drugs, which could be considered as discussing drug use. However, the rules specify that T is for text that shows drug use. If the user is not using the drugs but discussing their effects, it might be F. 

But the problem is that the user is talking about morphine and codeine, which are drugs. So maybe this is a T. However, the user is not explicitly using them. They are comparing their experience with them. 

Alternatively, the mention of "morphine" and "codeine" could be considered as slang or referring to drug use. But the user is not using them, just comparing. 

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The first part is about weed, which is a drug. The second part is about morphine and codeine, which are also drugs. However, the user is not necessarily using them. They are talking about their experience with these drugs. 

But according to the rules, if the text shows drug use, it's T. If the text is about discussing drug use, even if not currently using, maybe it's T. But the rules are about showing drug use, not discussing it. 

Wait, the label rules say T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). So if the text is discussing drug use, that might be T. But if it's just talking about the drugs without using them, maybe it's F. 

In this case, the user is talking about their experience with morphine and codeine. If they are using them, then it's T. But the user says "I do know morphine gives me less trouble than codeine." This could be a metaphor, but it's more likely a personal experience. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to using these drugs, but the statement is about their effects. 

I think the key here is whether the text shows drug use. The user is not necessarily using the drugs, but discussing them. So maybe this is F. But the mention of morphine and codeine is a drug, so maybe it's T. 

Alternatively, the user is talking about using morphine and codeine, but the statement is about their effects. 

I think the answer is T because the post mentions morphine and codeine, which are drugs, and the user is discussing their experience with them, which could be considered as drug use. However, the user is not explicitly stating that they are using them, but the mention of the drugs themselves might be considered as showing drug use. 

Alternatively, since the user is not using them, but discussing them, maybe it's F. 

But the rules state that T is when the text shows drug use. If the text is discussing drug use, even if not currently using, maybe it's T. 

This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of social media moderation, if the post is discussing the use of drugs, even if not currently using, it might be considered as T. 

But I think the correct answer here is T because the post mentions morphine and codeine, which are drugs, and the user is talking about their experience with them, which could be considered as drug use. Therefore, the label is T.
