Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "THIS MV REALLY LEOT YOONGI'S FULL ON CRACK SELF AND I AM HERE FOR IT THIS MAN IS FUNNIEST MAN ON EARTH PLEASE". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the key part is "FULL ON CRACK". "Crack" is a slang term for the drug crack cocaine. The phrase "full on crack" is a common slang expression meaning someone is really into or obsessed with a drug. The user is talking about YOONGI (a K-pop idol) being "full on crack", which implies he's using the drug. The rest of the post is about enjoying the music video and calling him funny, but the main point here is the mention of crack.

So, according to the rules, since the text explicitly mentions a slang term for drug use (crack), it should be labeled T. The other parts of the post are just commentary, but the presence of the drug-related slang is enough to trigger the T label. There's no mention of medical use, policy, or metaphor here. Therefore, the correct label is T.
