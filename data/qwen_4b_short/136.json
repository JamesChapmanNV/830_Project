Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Put down the crack pipe and slowly walk away from the keyboard."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention that T is for text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the phrase "crack pipe" is a slang term for a device used to inhale crack cocaine. So "crack pipe" is a direct reference to drug use. The command "Put down the crack pipe" is a clear indication of drug use. 

The other part of the sentence, "slowly walk away from the keyboard," might be a metaphor or a separate instruction, but the presence of "crack pipe" is enough to classify this as T. Even if the rest is metaphorical, the mention of the drug-related item is sufficient. 

So according to the rules, since the text includes a slang term for drugs (crack pipe), the label should be T.
