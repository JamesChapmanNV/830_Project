Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Gossiping with qai is literally my daily dose of morphine."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text uses terms like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The key words here are "daily dose of morphine." Morphine is a powerful opioid, which is an illicit drug. The phrase "daily dose" suggests regular use, which could indicate abuse. However, the context is "gossiping with qai." So, the person is saying that gossiping with someone is like taking morphine. Is this a metaphor or literal?

The user's instruction says that F includes metaphorical uses. But the question is whether the text shows actual drug use. If the person is using morphine as a slang term, then it's T. But if it's a metaphor for something else, like the pleasure from gossiping, then it's F.

But the phrase "literally my daily dose of morphine" is a strong metaphor. However, since morphine is a drug, even if it's a metaphor, the mention of the drug itself might still be considered T. Wait, the rules say T if it's using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So if the post is using the term "morphine" as a slang or in a way that refers to drug use, then it's T. But if it's a metaphor, then F. 

But the problem is that the user is using "morphine" in the context of their daily activity (gossiping). The phrase "literally my daily dose" is a metaphor for the pleasure or relief from gossiping. However, since morphine is a drug, even if it's a metaphor, the presence of the drug name might still be considered T. But according to the rules, F includes metaphor. Wait, the rules say T is for actual drug use, and F is for other cases, including metaphor. So if the text is using the drug in a metaphorical sense, it's F. But if the text is referring to actual drug use, then T.

But the post is not stating that the person is using morphine. It's saying that gossiping with qai is like a daily dose of morphine. So it's a metaphor for the pleasure or relief from gossiping. Therefore, the drug is being used as a metaphor, not actual use. So the label would be F. But wait, the user is using the term "morphine" which is a drug. However, the rules might consider that even if it's a metaphor, the presence of the drug name is T. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using "morphine" as a slang term. But in this case, the context is that the person is using the drug as a metaphor. So according to the rules, if it's a metaphor, it's F. Therefore, the answer should be F. But I'm not sure. Wait, the rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. If the text is using the drug in a metaphor, then it's not showing actual use. So F. But if the text is using the drug's name in a way that implies use, then T. But the user is not using the drug, they are comparing their activity to the effects of the drug. Therefore, it's a metaphor, so F.
