Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "George Floyd had almost 4 times the lethal amount of overdose in him of fentanyl."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post mentions George Floyd and the amount of fentanyl in his system. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, which is an illicit drug. The statement is about the lethal amount of fentanyl in his body, which relates to drug use. However, the key here is whether the post is directly indicating drug use. The phrase "overdose in him of fentanyl" might be a bit confusing. Wait, overdose is the result of drug use, so if he had a lethal amount of fentanyl, that implies he was using it. But the post is stating a fact about his medical condition, possibly from a news report or medical analysis. However, the presence of fentanyl in his system is a direct reference to drug use. So according to the rules, if it's about drug use, it's T. But the question is whether this is a case of drug use or just a medical fact. The post is stating a medical fact about the amount of fentanyl in his body, which is a result of drug use. But the label is about whether the text shows drug use. Since the post is talking about the presence of fentanyl in his system, which is a drug, it might be T. However, the label F includes medical discussions. Wait, the rules say F is for medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor. So if the post is a news report about a medical finding, then it's F. But the original instruction says to label T if it's about drug use. The post is stating a fact about the amount of fentanyl in his body, which is a medical fact. But the presence of fentanyl is a drug, so maybe it's T. Hmm, this is tricky. The key is whether the text is showing drug use. If the post is just stating a medical fact (like a news report), then it's F. But if it's indicating that he was using drugs, then it's T. The exact wording is "had almost 4 times the lethal amount of overdose in him of fentanyl." Wait, that might be a bit of a phrasing error. Maybe it's supposed to say "overdose amount" or "lethal dose." But regardless, the presence of fentanyl in his system is a drug, so if the post is discussing that, it's T. However, the label F includes medical discussions. So maybe this is a medical discussion, hence F. Alternatively, if the post is indicating that he was using fentanyl, then T. But the post is stating a fact about the amount of fentanyl in his system, which is a medical fact. Therefore, the label would be F. But I'm not sure. Wait, the rules say T is for text that shows drug use. If the text is about the presence of a drug in the body, that's showing drug use. So maybe T. But the post is not necessarily saying he was using it, but that he had a lethal amount. However, the fact that he had a lethal amount of fentanyl in his system implies that he was using it. Therefore, this would be T. But maybe the post is a medical report, so F. The line is thin. The user's instruction says to label T if it's showing drug use. The presence of fentanyl in his body is a result of drug use, so the text is showing drug use. Therefore, the answer is T.
