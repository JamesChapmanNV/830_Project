Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking me to determine if the given social media post falls under T (illicit drug use) or F (other cases). The post is: "pls his entire look has me screamingðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ SO FCKING HOT SIR YOONGI MARRY ME!!!"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs, drug use, or related slang. The main words here are "pls" (probably "please"), "screaming", "so fucking hot", and "YOONGI MARRY ME". 

Looking at the phrases, "so fucking hot" is a strong expression of admiration, likely referring to someone's appearance. The mention of YOONGI, who is a South Korean singer, might be part of a fan's message. There's no direct mention of drugs, drug use, buying, selling, trafficking, or any slang related to drugs. The exclamation "MARRY ME" is a romantic request, not related to drugs. 

The labels T and F are about whether the text shows drug use. Since there's no mention of drugs or related terms, even though the post is enthusiastic and emotional, it doesn't fit the T category. The F category includes medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. Here, the post is a personal expression of admiration, so it's F. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden slang or context. "Fcking" is a typo for "fucking", which is a strong word but not related to drugs. The rest of the words don't indicate drug use. Therefore, the label should be F.
