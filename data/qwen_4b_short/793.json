Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "any Philly weedheads doin' anything tomorrow like Iunno smoking cannabis". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, "weedheads" is a slang term for people who use weed, which is cannabis. The user is asking if any Philly weedheads are doing anything tomorrow, and then mentions "smoking cannabis". The word "smoking" here is directly related to using cannabis. 

So, the post is asking about people who use cannabis (weed) and mentions smoking it. That fits under T because it's discussing drug use. The other parts like "Philly" are just location, and "Iunno" might be a typo for "I know" or "I don't know", but the key part is the mention of smoking cannabis. 

Therefore, the label should be T.
