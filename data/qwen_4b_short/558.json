Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I knew something was off today. fix it." 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post: "I knew something was off today. fix it." The first part, "I knew something was off today," could be a metaphor. People sometimes say "something is off" to mean they feel something is wrong, but not necessarily related to drugs. The second part, "fix it," is a bit vague. It could be a call to action, but without more context, it's hard to tell. 

But wait, could "fix it" be a slang term for drug use? I'm not sure. In some contexts, people might use "fix" as in "fixing" a drug, like "fixing a headach" with a pill. But "fix it" on its own is pretty generic. The phrase "something was off" is more likely a metaphor for feeling unwell or something not right, not necessarily drug-related. 

There's no explicit mention of drugs, slang, or any direct reference to using, seeking, buying, etc. The post is pretty vague. So according to the rules, since there's no clear indication of drug use or related terms, it would fall under F. 

But I should double-check. Maybe "fix it" could be a slang term for something else. However, without more context, it's safer to assume it's not related to drugs. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so the label should be F unless there's a clear indication of drug use. Therefore, the answer is F.
