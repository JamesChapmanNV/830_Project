Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Back to Willett distillery for tonight's fresh crack. Old Bardstown Bottled in Bond."

First, I need to understand what the labels mean. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "fresh crack." Now, "crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. So that part is definitely a drug reference. The mention of "Willett distillery" and "Old Bardstown Bottled in Bond" seems like it's referring to a distillery, possibly a bourbon or whiskey brand. However, the phrase "fresh crack" is the critical part here. 

Wait, but is "crack" being used as a slang term here? Yes, in this context, "crack" refers to the drug. The distillery part might be a red herring, but the presence of "crack" as a slang term would trigger the T label. Even if the distillery is a real place, the use of "crack" here is a direct reference to the drug. 

So the post is talking about going to a distillery for "fresh crack," which is a slang term for crack cocaine. That's using the drug, so it should be labeled T. The other part about the distillery and the brand name might be a distraction, but the key is the mention of the drug. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphor here. The user says "fresh crack" in the context of a distillery. But "crack" as a drug is a slang term, so it's not a metaphor. Therefore, the label should be T.
