Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Coning out of heavy 'heroin' sedation, already beaten to death. LOSE ALL SON SIDE."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "heroin," which is an illicit drug. The phrase "heavy 'heroin' sedation" directly mentions the use of heroin, which is a controlled substance. Then there's the part about being "beaten to death," which might be a metaphor, but the main focus here is on the drug reference.

The second part, "LOSE ALL SON SIDE," is a bit unclear. It might be a typo or slang. "Lose all son side" doesn't make immediate sense. But given the context, the main point is the mention of heroin. The rules state that any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs should be labeled T. 

Even if the second part is unclear, the presence of "heroin" in the first part is enough to trigger the T label. The other part might be a separate statement, but since the main subject here is the drug use, the label should be T. I need to make sure there's no metaphorical use here. The context seems to be about someone who has been sedated with heroin and has been beaten. So, the drug use is explicit. Therefore, the label is T.
