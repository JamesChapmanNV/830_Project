Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Remember to warm them up slowly, so they don't crack." The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

First, I need to determine if the post relates to drug use. The sentence mentions warming something up slowly to prevent cracking. The word "them" is vague, but the context could be metaphorical. Maybe it's talking about something like ice cubes, or maybe a material that cracks when heated too quickly. But is there any drug-related terminology here?

Looking for keywords: "warm," "slowly," "crack." None of these are direct drug terms. The phrase "don't crack" could be a metaphor, but not necessarily related to drugs. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so I need to check if there's any slang or indirect reference. 

The post doesn't mention any drugs, their use, or related activities. It's more about a general instruction, possibly in a context like cooking or handling materials. Since there's no direct mention of drugs or drug-related terms, it doesn't fit the T category. Therefore, the label should be F.
