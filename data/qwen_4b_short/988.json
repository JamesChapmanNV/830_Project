Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the cost of a birthday party at "the codeine castle." The key here is the term "codeine." Codeine is a controlled substance, a narcotic, and is classified as an illicit drug. The label rules mention that any text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including slang, should be labeled T.

So, the post is asking about a party at a place named "codeine castle." The name itself is a slang term for a drug-related location, which might imply that the place is associated with drug use. Even if the question is about the cost, the mention of codeine, which is a controlled substance, would trigger the T label. The user isn't necessarily using codeine themselves but is referring to a location associated with it. According to the rules, any mention of drug slang or related terms counts as T. So the answer should be T.
