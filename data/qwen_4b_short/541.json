Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Nothing helps me put the kids to sleep like a spoonful of Chloroform and Morphine!" 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person is talking about using Chloroform and Morphine to put kids to sleep. Both Chloroform and Morphine are drugs. Chloroform is a depressant and has been used historically as an anesthetic, but it's considered an illicit drug. Morphine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and often associated with abuse. The mention of "spoonful" suggests a large amount, which might indicate misuse or abuse. 

The context here is using these drugs to put kids to sleep, which is not a medical use but rather a method that could be dangerous or illegal. The post doesn't mention any medical context or proper use, so it's more likely to be T. 

I should check if there's any possibility of metaphor. But "spoonful of Chloroform and Morphine" sounds like a literal statement about using these drugs. There's no indication of a metaphor here. 

Therefore, the correct label should be T.
