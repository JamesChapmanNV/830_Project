Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "OG Ron C & DJ Candlestick - Codeine Views #musicblogs #hiphop #newmusic". 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The main thing here is the mention of "Codeine Views". Codeine is a controlled substance, a type of opioid, and is classified as a Schedule II drug in the US. It's used medically but also has potential for abuse. 

Now, the phrase "Codeine Views" could be a song title or a reference to something related to codeine. But the question is whether the text is showing drug use. The post is about a music blog or hip hop track, so it's possible that the song's title is "Codeine Views". However, the label rules are about whether the text itself indicates drug use. 

But wait, the post doesn't explicitly mention using, selling, or any other drug-related activity. It's just the title of a song. Unless the song's title is a slang term or a reference to drug use, but "Codeine Views" might just be a creative title. However, codeine itself is a drug, so if the title is using the name of a drug, does that count as showing drug use? 

The rules say "slang for drugs" as well. But "Codeine" is a actual drug, not slang. However, the presence of the drug's name in the title might be considered as showing drug use. But the label is about whether the text shows drug use. If the text is just the title of a song, maybe it's not directly indicating use. 

Alternatively, if the song is about codeine, but the post doesn't mention that. The post is just the title and hashtags. So maybe it's F because it's not directly indicating use, but just mentioning a drug's name in a title. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the label rules: T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the text is using the name of a drug, is that considered showing drug use? For example, if someone says "I took codeine", that's T. But if the text is just the name of a song, maybe it's F. But the user might have a different take. 

Alternatively, maybe the hashtag #CodeineViews is part of the post. Wait, the post is "OG Ron C & DJ Candlestick - Codeine Views #musicblogs #hiphop #newmusic". So the title is "Codeine Views", and the hashtags. So the text is the title of a track, which might be a song about codeine, but the post itself doesn't state that. It's just the title. 

In that case, the text is not showing drug use, but just mentioning the drug's name in a title. So the label would be F. But I'm not 100% sure. However, according to the rules, unless the text is directly indicating use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The title is not indicating use, but the drug's name. So maybe it's F. But I'm a bit confused here. 

Alternatively, if the title is "Codeine Views", maybe it's a metaphor or a reference to something else. But the user might consider that as using the drug's name, which could be T. But I think the correct answer here is F because the text isn't showing drug use, just mentioning the drug's name in a title. So the answer is F.
