Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Drank so much codeine, drinking til im colour blind, she gon' do the coke until she can see the line."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the text, "codeine" is a drug, and "drinking til im colour blind" refers to the effects of codeine, which is an opioid. Then "do the coke" â€“ coke is slang for cocaine. The person is talking about using codeine and cocaine, which are both illicit drugs. 

The phrases "drinking til im colour blind" and "do the coke until she can see the line" are likely describing the effects of drug use, indicating that the person is using these drugs. The mention of "drinking" here is probably referring to consuming codeine, which is a drug. 

So, since the post mentions using codeine and cocaine, which are drugs, and the context is about using them, this should be labeled as T. The other cases would be if it's about medical discussion, policy, news, or discouraging use, but here it's clearly about using drugs. 

I need to make sure there's no metaphorical meaning here. The phrases about color blindness and seeing the line are common slang related to drug use. So, it's definitely T.
