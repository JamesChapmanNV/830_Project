Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "And your entire argument hinges on weather or not he died by overdose. But since two separate autopsies said he didn't then that idea falls flat on its face."

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "overdose" and "autopsies." The user is discussing whether someone died by overdose, which is related to drug use. However, the post is talking about the outcome of autopsies, which are medical examinations. The mention of overdose could be related to drug abuse, but the post itself is not stating that the person was using drugs. Instead, it's discussing the medical conclusion from autopsies. 

The label rules say T is for text that shows drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post here is not directly stating that the person used drugs, but rather discussing the medical findings. The term "overdose" might be considered a slang for drug overdose, but the context is about the cause of death as determined by autopsies. The post is not explicitly stating that the person was using drugs, but rather that the cause of death was determined by medical exams. 

So, according to the rules, if the text is about medical or policy discussion, it's F. Since the post is discussing the medical findings (autopsies) and the cause of death, it's not directly about drug use but about the medical conclusion. Therefore, the label should be F.
