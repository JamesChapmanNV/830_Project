Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Future can make an entire album or mixtape with songs like Codeine Crazy, Kno The Meaning, Perky's Calling, Purple Reign. I need to determine if this post falls under T or F based on the label rules.

First, the label rules: T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the user is asking about a music project. The song titles mentioned are Codeine Crazy, Kno The Meaning, Perky's Calling, Purple Reign. Wait, "Codeine Crazy" might be a song title. But "Codeine" is a drug, right? So if the song title includes "Codeine," does that count as a drug reference?

But the user isn't talking about using drugs. They're talking about creating music. The question is whether the mention of "Codeine" in the song title is considered a drug reference. The label rules mention slang for drugs. So if "Codeine" is a slang term here, but in reality, codeine is a drug. However, the song title might be using "codeine" as a metaphor or part of the song's theme, not necessarily indicating actual drug use.

But the user is asking if Future can make an album with those songs. The post itself doesn't state that the songs are about drug use. It's just a request about a music project. The mention of "Codeine Crazy" might be a song title, but unless the song is explicitly about drug use, the post isn't showing drug use. The user isn't discussing using drugs, seeking them, buying, etc. They're just talking about music. Therefore, this would fall under F, as it's not about drug use but a discussion about music. Unless the song titles are known to be about drug use, but the post doesn't indicate that. So the answer is F.
