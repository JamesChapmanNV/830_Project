Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a virtual program titled "Alternative Therapies: Cannabis Panel" organized by some veteran groups. The hashtag includes #cannabisforveterans and #420, which is a reference to cannabis.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The main topic here is cannabis, which is a drug. However, the context is a panel discussing alternative therapies, possibly for veterans. The hashtags might indicate that it's about medical or therapeutic use rather than recreational or illicit use. But the label rules mention that any mention of drugs, even in a medical context, could be T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. 

Wait, the rules say T if it's about drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang). The post is about a panel discussing cannabis as an alternative therapy. The key here is whether it's promoting or discussing the use of cannabis. Since it's a panel, it's likely discussing medical or therapeutic uses, which might be considered T if it's about using the drug. But the rules also include F for medical/policy discussions. Hmm, the rules say F is for medical/policy discussion, so maybe if it's a discussion about medical use, it's F. However, the label rules don't specify that medical use is F. Wait, the rules state F is all other cases except T. So if the post is about medical use, does that count as F? The rules don't explicitly say that. The user's instruction says T is when text shows illicit or abusive drug use, so if the post is about medical use, maybe it's F. But the problem is that cannabis is a drug, and if the post is promoting its use, even for medical purposes, it might still be T. But the label rules include F for medical/policy discussions. 

Wait, the label rules are: T is text that shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F is all other cases, including medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor. So if the post is about a panel discussing cannabis as an alternative therapy, that's a medical or policy discussion, so it would be F. But the post is not explicitly promoting use, but rather organizing a panel. The hashtags include #cannabisforveterans, which might imply that it's for medical use. So the answer would be F because it's a medical discussion. However, the term "cannabis" is a drug, but the context is a panel discussing its use in therapy, which is medical. Therefore, according to the rules, F would be the correct label.
