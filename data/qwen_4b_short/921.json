Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "You're a good sport Jack. You're not just pulling it off, you're rocking it!" 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for everything else, like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the words used are "good sport," "pulling it off," and "rocking it." Now, I need to check if any of these terms are related to drug use. "Rocking it" is a common slang phrase that can mean doing something well, but sometimes it's used in the context of drug use. However, in this case, the context is about someone being a "good sport," which is a metaphor for being enthusiastic or performing well. 

The phrase "pulling it off" is also a metaphor for succeeding or doing something successfully. There's no direct mention of drugs here. The name "Jack" is just a name. So, the post is using metaphors to commend someone's performance, not discussing drug use. 

I should check if any of the words are considered drug slang. "Rocking it" can sometimes be associated with drug use, but in this context, it's more likely a metaphor. The other phrases don't seem to relate to drugs. Therefore, the label should be F because there's no indication of drug use or related terms. The post is just a positive comment on someone's performance.
