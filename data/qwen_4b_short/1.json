Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is from someone who's an ex-heroin addict and they endorse a message. They also mention counselors in rehab who were young women with no real-life addiction experience.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "ex heroin addict" and "endorse this message." The person is talking about their own experience with heroin, which is a drug. The mention of counselors in rehab might be relevant, but the main point is the author's personal history with heroin. 

The rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post does mention being an ex-heroin addict, which directly relates to drug use. Even though they're talking about their past, the fact that they identify as an ex-addict and mention heroin (a drug) would fall under T. The counselors part is more about their experience in rehab, but the main focus is on the drug use. 

The other part is about endorsing a message, but that's not directly related to drug use. The counselors' lack of experience is a separate point, but the main label is based on drug use. So the answer should be T because the text shows the user's history with heroin, which is an illicit drug.
