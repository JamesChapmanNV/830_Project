Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "HOW TO CRACK JEE IN 1 MONTH | 100% SELECTION GUARANTEED". 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the keywords are "CRACK JEE" and "100% SELECTION GUARANTEED". JEE is the Joint Entrance Examination in India, so "crack JEE" is about preparing for a competitive exam. There's no mention of drugs here. The phrase "crack" in this context is a metaphor for succeeding in the exam. The rest of the text is about exam preparation, not drug-related activities. 

I don't see any drug slang, references to using, selling, or any illicit activities. The post is about academic success, so it's clearly in the F category. Therefore, the label should be F.
