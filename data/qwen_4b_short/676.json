Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "HIT HER WITH NO CONDOM HAD TO MAKE HER EAT A PLAN B AND IM SIPPIN ON THAT CODEINE NOT BRANDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let's break down the post.

"HIT HER WITH NO CONDOM" – that's about not using a condom, which might relate to sexual activity but not directly drugs. Then "HAD TO MAKE HER EAT A PLAN B" – Plan B is a morning-after pill, which is a medical term, not a drug. But maybe the user is referring to something else? Wait, Plan B is a contraceptive, so that's medical. Then "IM SIPPIN ON THAT CODEINE NOT BRANDY" – here, "codeine" is a drug. Codeine is an opioid, which is an illicit drug. The user is saying they are drinking codeine, which is using the drug. Also, the exclamation marks and the repetition might indicate emphasis, but the key part is "codeine".

So the post mentions codeine, which is a drug. Therefore, according to the rules, this would be labeled T. The other parts might not be drug-related, but the mention of codeine is enough. Let me double-check. The user is using codeine, which is an illicit drug. So the answer should be T.
