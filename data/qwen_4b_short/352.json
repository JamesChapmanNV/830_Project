Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Try his friend who was in the passenger seat who sold him the drugs. He is responsible for George Floyd's overdose."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key parts are "sold him the drugs" and "responsible for George Floyd's overdose." The mention of selling drugs directly relates to drug use and trafficking, which falls under T. Also, the reference to George Floyd's overdose is a real event, but the main point here is the sale of drugs. The phrase "try his friend" might be a bit ambiguous, but the context of selling drugs and the overdose suggests that the post is discussing drug-related activities. 

I need to check if there's any metaphor or if it's just a news report. However, the mention of selling drugs and being responsible for an overdose clearly indicates drug use and trafficking. The name George Floyd is a real person, but the context here is about the friend who sold drugs leading to an overdose. So, this seems like a T case. The answer should be T.
