Okay, let's tackle this labeling. The user wants to know if the post is T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: ""but muh heritage" meanwhile they're out in a double-wide shooting up heroin and losing teeth from meth. but hey at least they have their heritage right?" 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use. The key terms here are "heroin" and "meth." Both are illicit drugs. The phrase "shooting up heroin" directly refers to using heroin, which is a drug. "Losing teeth from meth" also clearly indicates meth use. The user is talking about someone using these drugs, so that's a T. 

The mention of "heritage" is a metaphor here, probably contrasting the person's cultural heritage with their drug use. The phrase "but hey at least they have their heritage right?" is a sarcastic comment, but the main point is the drug use. Since the post includes explicit references to heroin and meth, which are illicit drugs, the label should be T. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that might make it F. The post is about someone using drugs, so it's definitely T. No medical or policy discussion here. The answer is T.
