Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "ACLU sues to remove cannabis from Nevada pharmacy list of Schedule I drugs". 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

The post here is about the ACLU suing to remove cannabis from the Schedule I drugs list in Nevada pharmacies. Schedule I drugs are classified as having a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. Cannabis is currently classified as Schedule I in some states, but this is a legal and policy-related issue. The ACLU is a legal organization advocating for civil liberties, so this seems like a legal case or policy discussion. 

The post doesn't mention any personal use, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. It's about a legal action to change the classification. Therefore, this is a news or policy-related post, not directly about drug use. So the label should be F. 

I need to make sure there's no slang or hidden reference. The term "cannabis" is used, but it's in the context of legal classification, not personal use. So no T here. The answer is F.
