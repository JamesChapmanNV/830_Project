Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "*takes an ambien, 5 valium & 2 codeine... [generations later] *rubs cobwebs from eyes What year is it?"

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the first part: "takes an ambien, 5 valium & 2 codeine". Ambien, Valium, and Codeine are all drugs. Ambien is a sedative, Valium is a benzodiazepine, and Codeine is an opioid. The user is explicitly mentioning taking these drugs, which are all classified as illicit or controlled substances. The quantities mentioned (5 Valium and 2 Codeine) might indicate abuse or dependence, but even the act of taking them counts under T.

The rest of the post is about rubbing cobwebs from eyes and asking the year. That seems like a metaphor or a random comment, but the initial part clearly references drug use. The label should be T because the text directly mentions taking drugs. The other parts don't relate to drug use, but the first part is enough to trigger the T label. So the answer is T.
