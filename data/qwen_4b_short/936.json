Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Bro. Don't forget, he's Keith Richard's son. Good Anti whiskey and heroin genes."

First, I need to understand the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main points are mentioning Keith Richard's son and "Good Anti whiskey and heroin genes." Keith Richards is a famous musician known for his drug use, particularly heroin. The phrase "Good Anti whiskey and heroin genes" is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's a play on words. "Anti" here might be a typo or a slang term. Alternatively, it could be a metaphor. But the mention of "heroin genes" directly refers to a genetic predisposition to drug use. 

The term "heroin genes" is a slang or metaphor for someone having a family history of drug abuse. However, the key here is whether the text is showing illicit drug use. The post is not explicitly stating that someone is using drugs, but rather talking about genetic predisposition. However, the mention of heroin is a direct reference to an illicit drug. 

But wait, the user's instruction says T includes "slang for drugs." So "heroin genes" is a slang term that refers to a genetic tendency towards drug use. Even if it's a metaphor, the mention of heroin (an illicit drug) would still fall under T. However, the post is not stating that the person is using drugs, but rather talking about their genes. But the presence of the drug name itself might still trigger the T label. 

Alternatively, maybe the phrase is a joke or a metaphor. But according to the rules, if the text includes slang for drugs, it's T. The term "heroin genes" is a slang term. So even if it's a metaphor, the presence of the drug name would make it T. Therefore, the label should be T.
