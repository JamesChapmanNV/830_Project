Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Every day I ask myself 'Why the fuck isn't Flinstones Chewable Morphine real?' Because a lot of people could use something like it as the world is burning before our very eyes."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for mentions of drugs, their use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. 

The post mentions "Flinstones Chewable Morphine." Morphine is a controlled substance, an opioid, which is an illicit drug. The term "Chewable" might be a slang or a creative way to refer to a drug form. The user is questioning why this drug isn't real, implying they want to use it. The phrase "could use something like it" suggests they are seeking or desiring the drug. 

The word "fuck" is used, but that's just profanity and doesn't relate to drug use. The context of the post is about wanting a drug (Morphine) that's not real, which is a clear indication of seeking drug use. 

So according to the rules, T is for text that shows drug use. The mention of Morphine, which is an illicit drug, and the desire to have it, even if it's not real, fits the T category. The other parts of the post are about the world burning, which is metaphorical, but the main focus is on the drug. 

Therefore, the label should be T.
