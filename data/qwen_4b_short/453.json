Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a podcast episode discussing careers in cannabis, specifically mentioning legalization leading to more career opportunities and an interview with someone from Calyx Staffing.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Cannabis Legalization" and "Careers in Cannabis." The topic is about the legal cannabis industry, which is a medical or policy discussion. The post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. It's more about career opportunities in a legal sector. 

The label rules say T is for drug use related terms, and F is for other cases like medical/policy. Since the post is discussing the legalization and career opportunities in a legal context, it's not about drug abuse. Therefore, the correct label should be F.
