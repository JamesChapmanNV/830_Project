Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F. The post says, "I really don't feel good from the hospital last night they gave me morphine and it makes me feeling yucky right now." 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

So the post mentions morphine. Morphine is a prescription opioid, commonly used for pain management. The person is talking about receiving it from the hospital. The key here is whether this is considered illicit or abusive drug use. 

Morphine is a controlled substance, but it's also a medication prescribed for medical purposes. The user is not talking about using it recreationally or in a way that's considered abuse. They're describing a medical treatment they received. The mention of feeling "yucky" is a side effect of morphine, which is a known adverse reaction. 

The post doesn't mention any slang terms, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. It's a personal account of a medical treatment. Therefore, this would fall under F because it's a medical discussion, not about illicit drug use. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if morphine is considered an illicit drug. No, morphine is a controlled substance but it's legal when prescribed. The context here is medical use, so it's not considered abuse or illicit use. The user is not using it for non-medical purposes. So the label should be F.
