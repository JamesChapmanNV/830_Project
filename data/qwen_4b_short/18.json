Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "When I were growing up all we had for brekkie was an intravenous injection of morphine, and had only a penguin in the Gobi to look forward to for supper!" 

First, I need to check if this text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key part is "intravenous injection of morphine." Morphine is a controlled substance, an opioid, which is classified as an illicit drug. The phrase "intravenous injection" indicates administration of the drug, which is a method of use. 

Then there's "a penguin in the Gobi to look forward to for supper." That part seems like a metaphor or a humorous way to describe something unappetizing, maybe a metaphor for something unpleasant. But the main point here is the mention of morphine. 

Since the post explicitly mentions the use of morphine through an injection, that's a clear indication of drug use. Even if the rest is metaphorical, the presence of the drug use part makes it a T. 

I should make sure there's no other context that might make this F. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so any mention of drug use, even if it's part of a story, should be labeled T. The other part about the penguin might be a metaphor, but the main action here is the use of morphine. 

So the label should be T.
