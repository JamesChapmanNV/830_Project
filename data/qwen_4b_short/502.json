Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post: The person is talking about their stress when their tweets get popular, mentioning that friends have "cracked under the strain." The phrase "cracked under the strain" might be a metaphor. They also mention avoiding attention to prevent stress. There's no direct mention of drugs, slang, or any explicit reference to drug use. The mention of friends cracking could be a metaphor for mental breakdown, not necessarily drug-related. The context is about social media stress and mental health, not drug abuse. So according to the rules, this doesn't fit T. Therefore, the label should be F.
