Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about the cousin who died from an overdose and mentions he was a talented tattoo artist.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is the mention of overdose. Overdose is a direct result of drug use, so that's a clear indicator. The post states he died from an overdose, which is a consequence of drug abuse. Even though the post also mentions his talent as a tattoo artist, the main point is the overdose. The rules say T if there's any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Overdose is a result of drug use, so that's a T. The other parts are about his talent, which is F. But since the overdose is directly mentioned, the label should be T. I need to make sure there's no other drug-related terms. The post doesn't mention any slang or specific drugs, but the overdose itself is enough for T. So the answer is T.
