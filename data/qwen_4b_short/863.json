Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "anyone want to wager on if this gets fixed over a... *weekend*? The BC CDC is no longer a 'fair dealer' in any discussion. Their credibility long gone."

First, I need to check if this post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, the key parts are "BC CDC" and "fair dealer." Wait, BC CDC might refer to the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, but I'm not sure. However, the term "fair dealer" here is probably a metaphor. The user is criticizing the CDC's credibility, maybe in the context of drug policy or something related. But there's no direct mention of drugs, using, selling, etc. The phrase "fair dealer" is likely a metaphor for someone who is unbiased or fair, but in this case, the person is saying they're no longer a fair dealer, implying they're not trustworthy. 

The mention of "weekend" and "fixed" might be about a policy change or something related to drug abuse, but without explicit terms like "drugs," "using," "buying," "selling," or slang, it's not a direct T. The post is more about criticizing an organization's credibility in a discussion, possibly related to drug policies, but not directly about drug use. So according to the rules, since there's no explicit mention of drug use or related terms, it should be F. 

Wait, but maybe "fair dealer" is a slang term for drugs? Like in some contexts, "dealer" can refer to drug dealers. But the term "fair dealer" here is more likely a metaphor for someone who is impartial or fair in discussions. The user is saying the CDC is no longer a fair dealer, meaning they're not trustworthy in discussions. So the post is about criticism of an organization's credibility, not about drug use itself. Therefore, the label should be F.
