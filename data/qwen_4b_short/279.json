Okay, let's see. The user is asking about what to wear to a budtender appreciation event by a cannabis brand called Timeless. The label rules are T for drug use-related text and F for other cases.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drug use. The post is about attending an event related to a cannabis brand. The term "budtender" refers to someone who works in a cannabis retail store, so the event is probably related to the cannabis industry. The question is about clothing for the event, not about using drugs. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or slang for drugs. The brand is "Timeless," which is a cannabis company. The post is asking about attire, which is a general question. So, there's no indication of drug abuse or illicit drug use here. Therefore, the label should be F.
