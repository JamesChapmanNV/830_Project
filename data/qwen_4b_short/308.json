Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about educating Americans on the Endocannabinoid system and how cannabis works medicinally, including treating certain cancers without toxic effects on healthy cells.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key terms here are "cannabis" and "Endocannabinoid system." Cannabis is a drug, but the post is talking about its medicinal use. The rules mention T if it's about illicit or abusive drug use. However, the post is discussing medical applications, so maybe that's a F? But wait, the label rules say F includes medical/policy discussion. The post is about educating on how cannabis works medicinally, so that's a medical discussion. Therefore, it's F. But wait, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so even if it's medical, if it's about cannabis, which is a drug, does that count as T? The rules specify T is for text showing illicit or abusive use. The post is about medicinal use, not abuse. So F. The answer should be F.
