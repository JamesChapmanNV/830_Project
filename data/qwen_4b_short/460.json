Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "that fucking drug dealer didnt have the right shit AND out me in handcuffs fuck you".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let's break down the post.

The first part is "that fucking drug dealer". The term "drug dealer" directly refers to someone involved in selling drugs, which is trafficking. So that's a T. Then "didn't have the right shit". The word "shit" here is slang for drugs, especially in the context of drug use. So that's also T. The next part is "AND out me in handcuffs". "Out me in handcuffs" is about being arrested, which relates to drug trafficking or use. Finally, "fuck you" is just a curse word, not related to drugs.

So the key parts here are "drug dealer" (trafficking), "right shit" (slang for drugs), and being in handcuffs (arrested for drug-related activity). All these elements point to T. Even though there's a curse word, the main content is about drug dealing and being arrested, which falls under T. Therefore, the label should be T.
