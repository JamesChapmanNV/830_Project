Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Like medically speaking she knew that morphine wasn't going to help her. She even said it before she gave it so idk why she just said fuck it. That was wild af".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the mention of "morphine" is a drug. Morphine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance, so that's a drug. The person says she knew morphine wasn't going to help her, and she even said it before giving it. Then she says "fuck it" and "wild af". 

Now, "fuck it" is slang, but the main point here is the mention of morphine. The user is talking about a medical context, but the fact that morphine is mentioned is a drug. However, the post is about her knowing that morphine wouldn't help, so maybe it's a medical discussion. But the question is whether it's T or F. 

The rules say T if it's about drug use. The post is talking about morphine, which is a drug. Even if it's in a medical context, the presence of the drug name might still be considered T. However, the user is discussing the medical aspect, not the use. Wait, the rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the text is discussing the use, even in a medical context, but here the person is talking about her knowing that morphine wouldn't help. Maybe it's a medical discussion, but the mention of morphine is a drug. However, the user is not using it, but discussing its ineffectiveness. 

But the key is whether the text shows drug use. The post is about her knowing that morphine wasn't helpful, and she said it before giving it. Then she says "fuck it". The term "fuck it" is slang, but the main drug here is morphine. However, the post is in a medical context. The rules include medical discussions as F. Wait, the label rules say F is for all other cases, including medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor. So if the post is discussing morphine in a medical context, even if it's a drug, it's F. But the problem is that the post is talking about using morphine, but in a medical context. 

Wait, but the rules say T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the text is about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So in this case, the post is talking about morphine, which is a drug. But is it considered as showing drug use? The person is discussing the medical aspect, but the mention of morphine is a drug. However, the post is not about using it, but about knowing it wouldn't help. So maybe it's F. 

Alternatively, maybe the use of "morphine" is a drug, so it's T. But the rules say that F includes medical discussions. So if the text is about medical discussion, even if the drug is mentioned, it's F. 

So the post is a medical discussion about morphine, so F. But the user is saying that she knew morphine wasn't going to help her, and she said it before giving it. So maybe the post is about the use of morphine, but in a medical context. 

Wait, but the user is talking about her giving morphine. So maybe she was using it, but in a medical context. However, the rules say that T is if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. If it's a medical use, then it's F. But the problem is that the user is talking about her using morphine, which is a drug. But the label rules say that F includes medical discussions. So even if the drug is mentioned, if it's in a medical context, it's F. 

Therefore, the answer would be F. But I need to be careful. The post is about a medical situation, but the mention of morphine is a drug. However, the user is not engaging in the use, but discussing it. Therefore, F.
