Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Other than the plague, not yet :( gonna crack into my last Raymond chandler finally! Then I'll have read them all I think. & ima read world war z o.o"

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post: The user mentions "the plague" which could be a reference to a disease, but not sure if it's a drug. Then they talk about reading books: "Raymond Chandler" (a detective novelist) and "World War Z" (a movie/book about a zombie apocalypse). The phrase "crack into my last Raymond Chandler" might be a typo or slang? "Crack into" could mean reading or starting to read, but "crack" can sometimes be slang for drugs, but in this context, it's more likely referring to reading. The user also says "ima read world war z o.o" which is probably "I'm going to read World War Z" with some typos.

No mention of drugs, drug use, selling, buying, trafficking, or slang. The mention of "plague" is a stretch and not related to drugs. The rest is about reading books. So according to the rules, this should be F.
