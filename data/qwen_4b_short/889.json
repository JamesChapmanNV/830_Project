Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is "Thank you on behalf of all Lebanese." The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, which includes medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drugs or drug-related activities. The post is a simple thank you statement on behalf of Lebanese people. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any related terms. The phrase "Lebanese" refers to the country or people, not any drug-related context. 

I should consider if there's any possible slang or metaphor that I'm missing. But "Lebanese" is a nationality, and the sentence is just expressing gratitude. There's no indication of drug use here. So according to the rules, since there's no mention of drugs or drug-related activities, the label should be F. 

I don't see any other elements that fit the T category. The post is a general statement without any drug-related content. Therefore, the correct label is F.
