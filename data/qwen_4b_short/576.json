Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about Anthony Durante, a professional wrestler, who had an accidental overdose of oxycodone or fentanyl in 2003 when he was 36.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post mentions an accidental overdose involving oxycodone and fentanyl. Both of these are prescription opioids, which are controlled substances. However, the key here is whether the post is indicating drug use. The statement is about an accident that happened to someone, not necessarily that the person was using drugs. It's more of a news or medical event. The post doesn't mention the person seeking, using, buying, or selling drugs. It's just reporting an incident. So according to the rules, since it's not about the use or abuse but rather an accidental overdose event, it should be labeled F. Unless the overdose is considered a form of drug use, but the rule specifies that T is for showing drug use. Since the post is just stating an event without indicating the person was using drugs, it's F.
