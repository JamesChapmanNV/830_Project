Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Abt to go codeine crazy with this lite cold before it get too crazy lol".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "codeine" and "crazy". Codeine is a controlled substance, an opioid, and is considered an illicit drug. The phrase "go codeine crazy" suggests the person is planning to use codeine excessively, which is a sign of abuse. The mention of a "lite cold" might be a slang way of saying a mild cold, but the main point is the intent to use codeine. The use of "crazy" here is likely a metaphor, but the actual drug use is the focus. Since the post directly mentions using codeine, which is an illicit drug, and the context implies abuse, the label should be T. The other options like F would be for medical discussions or discouraging use, but this is about using the drug. So the answer is T.
