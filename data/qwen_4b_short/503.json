Okay, let's see. The user provided a post that says: "I remain the glass could peel, the paint could shatter (yeah) When there ain't a crack in the bones are good, the glass could". They want me to label this as T or F based on the rules given.

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the text: "glass could peel, the paint could shatter". The words "glass" and "paint" are mentioned, but I don't see any direct reference to drugs. The phrase "the bones are good" is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a metaphor? 

Wait, maybe "glass" here is a metaphor. In some contexts, "glass" can be slang for drugs, like "glass pipes" for smoking cannabis. But the phrase "the glass could peel" might not be a common slang. Alternatively, "bones" could be a metaphor for something else, like physical strength or structure. 

But the user is asking about drug abuse. The post doesn't explicitly mention any drug-related terms. It seems more like a poetic or metaphorical expression. There's no clear indication of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. The words "crack" are in there, but "crack" can refer to the drug crack cocaine, but in the sentence, it's part of "when there ain't a crack in the bones". That might be a metaphor for something else, like a crack in something else, not necessarily a drug.

So, based on the given rules, since there's no direct mention of drug use or slang, the label should be F. The post is more about metaphors and imagery without any explicit drug reference.
