Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post mentions inserting a Trainspotting heroin joke into a game preview. Trainspotting is a movie that's associated with drug use, specifically heroin. The mention of "heroin joke" directly references drug use. Even though the person is talking about a joke, the presence of the drug name (heroin) and the context of the movie (Trainspotting) which is about drug use, would fall under the T category. The rest of the post talks about ordering takeaway, getting drunk, and having days off, which might be F, but the key here is the explicit mention of heroin. So the label should be T.
