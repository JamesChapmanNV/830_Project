Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post talks about using THC and morphine, mentions feeling sick, using it to eat and manage pain. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, the post mentions "THC," which is a controlled substance, so that's a red flag. Then it says "Morphine ER," which is a prescription drug, but the user is comparing it. The user says THC helped them eat and not feel sick, and they skipped harder stuff. 

The rules state T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post clearly mentions using THC (a drug) and comparing it to morphine. The user is talking about their own use of THC, which is a drug. Even though they mention it helped with pain, the act of using it is the key here. The mention of "low dose" and "skipping doses of harder stuff" indicates they are using drugs. 

So, since the text is about using THC, which is an illicit drug, and discussing its use, the label should be T. The other parts are about effects, but the main action is using the drug. So the answer is T.
