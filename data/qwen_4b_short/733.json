Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about a legal case where the defense claims George died of an overdose, but the prosecution and defense will both call their own medical witnesses to determine the cause of death.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit drug use. The key terms here are "overdose" and "pathology witnesses." The defense's line is that George died of an overdose, which is a medical term. However, the post doesn't explicitly mention any specific drug name or slang. It's about the legal process of determining the cause of death, which involves medical experts. 

The rules state that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention any of these activities. It's more about the legal proceedings and the determination of cause of death by medical experts. There's no indication of actual drug use, seeking, or related activities. 

So, even though "overdose" is a medical term, the context here is about the legal process rather than the actual use of drugs. The post is discussing the medical experts' role in determining the cause, not the use of drugs. Therefore, it should be labeled F, as it's not about drug use but a medical or legal discussion.
