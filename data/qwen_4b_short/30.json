Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about Upwise Capital exhibiting at a cannabis conference in Miami Beach. The key words here are "Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference" and "Exhibiting". The mention of cannabis might relate to drugs, but the context is a business exhibition. The post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. It's promoting a booth at a conference, so it's more about business than drug use. Therefore, the label should be F.
