Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "eren doing heroin and i shake my phone so violently". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text indicates using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, "eren doing heroin" â€“ "eren" might be a typo or a name, but "doing heroin" clearly refers to using heroin, which is an illicit drug. The second part, "i shake my phone so violently", might be a metaphor or a symptom of drug use. However, the key part here is the mention of heroin. 

Since heroin is a controlled substance and the post directly states that someone is using it, this should be labeled T. The shaking could be a side effect, but the main point is the explicit mention of drug use. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that would make this F. But the post is straightforward: someone is using heroin. So the label should be T.
