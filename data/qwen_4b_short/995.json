Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Of the molly and codeine that's my medication i just killed my first rapper it's a celebration ;b"

First, I need to understand the rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: The user mentions "molly" and "codeine". Molly is a slang term for Molly, which is a synthetic drug, often a derivative of methamphetamine. Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. So both are drugs. The user says "that's my medication", which implies they are using these substances for medical purposes, but the context might be different.

Then the user says, "i just killed my first rapper it's a celebration ;b". The phrase "killed my first rapper" is a bit confusing. In slang, "killing" can mean something like "killing" a person, but in this context, it might be a metaphor. However, given the mention of drugs, maybe it's referring to using drugs and "killing" as in consuming, but that's not clear. Alternatively, "killed" could be a metaphor for something else. But the key part is the mention of molly and codeine, which are drugs. 

So, the presence of "molly" and "codeine" (which is a drug) would trigger the T label. Even if the user is using them as medication, the fact that they are referring to illicit drugs (molly is often a slang for a drug, not a medical term) might still fall under T. Also, the context of using them and the mention of "killing a rapper" might be a metaphor, but the main point is the drugs themselves. 

So, the label here would be T because the text mentions the use of drugs (molly and codeine), which are illicit or abusive drugs. Even if they are used as medication, the presence of the slang terms and the context of use would still fit the T category.
