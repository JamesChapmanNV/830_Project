Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Oohhhhhh. Now suddenly focus shd be on a dealer but with SSR it was about his depression!!"

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. The user mentions "focus shd be on a dealer" which might be referring to a focus on a dealer, possibly in a context like a drug-related story. Then there's "with SSR it was about his depression!!" SSR could be an abbreviation. In drug-related contexts, SSR might stand for "Stimulant Substance Replacement" or maybe "Sertraline" (an SSRI antidepressant), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, SSR could be slang for something else.

Looking at the rules: T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

The post mentions a dealer, which is directly related to drug trafficking or selling. The mention of "focus shd be on a dealer" suggests that the context is about someone dealing drugs. The part about "SSR it was about his depression" might be a bit confusing. If SSR is a slang term for a drug, then that would be T. But if it's a medical term, like an antidepressant, then maybe not. However, the mention of depression could be a red herring. The key here is the mention of a dealer. Since "dealer" is directly related to drug trafficking, that's a T. Even if the rest is about depression, the presence of "dealer" makes it T. So the label should be T.
