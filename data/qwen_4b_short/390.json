Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Keep up the pressure. They are starting to crack". 

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The phrase "keep up the pressure" could be a metaphor, maybe related to a situation where someone is trying to exert pressure on others. The second part, "They are starting to crack," might be referring to something breaking down, like a system or a person's mental state. 

But the rules specify that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

So, I need to check if the post has any direct reference to drugs. The words "crack" could be a slang term for crack cocaine. However, in the context of the sentence, "They are starting to crack" might be a metaphor for something else, like a system failing or a person's mental state. 

But the user is moderating for drug abuse, so I need to be careful. If "crack" is used as a slang term for the drug, then it would be T. However, without more context, it's possible that "crack" here is not referring to the drug. The sentence seems more like a general statement about pressure leading to failure, not specifically about drugs. 

Alternatively, if "crack" is part of a slang term, but the sentence doesn't explicitly mention any drug-related activities. The post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or any other drug-related terms. It's more about applying pressure and something cracking, which could be metaphorical.

Therefore, since there's no direct mention of drug use or slang, the label would be F. The user is supposed to return only T or F, so the answer should be F.
