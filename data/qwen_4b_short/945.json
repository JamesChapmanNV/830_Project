Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is a bit confusing and has some random phrases. Let me break it down.

First, the main elements: the mention of #Fentanyl and #NYPD. Fentanyl is an illicit drug, so that's a clear T. The user is talking about fentanyl in heroin, which is drug use. Then there's a mention of ER professionals in Dakota, Idaho. Wait, maybe that's a reference to someone involved in drug trafficking? The part about "Horse Stable" might be a slang or a metaphor, but the key here is the mention of fentanyl and heroin. 

Then there's a part about "No potato's his wife is working for the #NYPD no advance, sprinkle crack on The white evil will auto love we for litteringüçåon the streets". The mention of crack is another drug, so that's T. The term "littering" with a banana emoji might be a metaphor, but the presence of drug names like fentanyl, heroin, crack, and the context of trafficking (ER professionals, trafficking, etc.) points towards drug use.

Even though some parts are unclear or metaphorical, the presence of drug names and references to drug-related activities (trafficking, selling) would trigger the T label. The other parts like "white evil" and "littering" might be metaphors, but the key is that the post is about drug use. So the answer should be T.
