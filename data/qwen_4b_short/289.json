Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: ""Put codeine on a salad" -Two Chains      Most ignant lyric of 2016".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rule says T if the text mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the phrase "Put codeine on a salad" is the key part. Codeine is a controlled substance, classified as an opioid, which is a drug. The phrase "put codeine on a salad" is likely a metaphor or a slang expression. But wait, codeine is a drug, so if someone is talking about using it, that would be T. However, the context here is a lyric from a song, which might be using codeine in a metaphorical sense, like a humorous or slang way. 

But the rules mention that if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, it's T. The phrase "Put codeine on a salad" could be a reference to using codeine, which is an illicit drug. However, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the lyric is about using codeine, that would be T. But I need to check if it's just a metaphor. 

Alternatively, maybe the lyric is using codeine as a metaphor for something else. But codeine is a drug, so if the lyric is about using it, that would be T. The second part of the post says "Most ignant lyric of 2016" â€“ maybe a typo for "Most ignorable" or "Most ignant" is a misspelling. But regardless, the main point is the lyric itself.

The user is asking to label based on the rules. Since codeine is a drug, and the lyric is "Put codeine on a salad", which could be a reference to using codeine, that would be T. However, if it's a metaphor, maybe not. But the rules don't specify metaphors as not T. The rule says T if it shows drug use. So if the lyric is about using codeine, then T. But is "put codeine on a salad" a way of using codeine? Maybe it's a slang term or a metaphor. However, codeine is a drug, so even if it's a metaphor, the mention of codeine itself is a drug. 

Wait, the rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the text is about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The phrase "Put codeine on a salad" is a lyric. The word "codeine" is a drug. So even if it's a metaphor, the mention of codeine is a drug. Therefore, this would be T. 

Alternatively, maybe the lyric is using codeine in a non-literal way, but the presence of the drug name would still trigger T. So the answer should be T.
