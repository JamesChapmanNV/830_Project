Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I got a syrup addiction, Im in love wit codeine". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, "syrup addiction" might be a reference to codeine, which is an opioid. Codeine is a controlled substance, so that's a drug. The phrase "in love wit codeine" is a bit informal, but "codeine" is a drug. The user is talking about being addicted to codeine, which is a form of drug use. 

"Syrup" here could be a slang term for something else, but in this context, since they mention codeine, it's likely referring to codeine syrup. The key here is that the person is admitting to an addiction to codeine, which is an illicit drug. 

So according to the rules, T is for text that shows drug use. Therefore, this post should be labeled T.
