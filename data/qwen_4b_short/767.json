Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about fentanyl lollipops (Actiq) causing tooth decay due to high sugar content and mentions monitoring is required.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The term "fentanyl lollipop (Actiq)" is mentioned. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid, which is an illicit drug. Actiq is a brand name for a fentanyl lozenge used in medical settings, typically for pain management in cancer patients. However, the post is talking about the side effect of tooth decay from the high sugar content. 

The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use. The post is informing about a side effect of the drug, not about using or seeking the drug. The mention of "common drug for cancer patients" might suggest it's a medical use, but the main point is the side effect. The label rules specify that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, such as using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The post doesn't mention using the drug, but rather its side effect. The term "drug" here is in the context of a prescribed medication, not illicit use. However, the presence of fentanyl, which is an illicit drug, might be a point of confusion. But the post is not about using or seeking the drug; it's about a side effect. The label F is for other cases like medical discussion. 

So the correct label here would be F because it's discussing a medical side effect of a drug, not the use or abuse of drugs. The mention of "common drug for cancer patients" is part of the medical context, so it's not indicating illicit use. Therefore, the answer is F.
