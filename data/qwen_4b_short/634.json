Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Glad it went well. Morphine is ace. When i was on it I became convinced Nascar was the most interesting thing ever. That's a powerful drug."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Morphine" and "ace" (which is slang for morphine, I think). The user mentions being "on it" which refers to using morphine. Also, they say "That's a powerful drug," which directly refers to morphine. 

Morphine is a controlled substance, typically used medically but also associated with abuse. The post talks about using it and the effects, which aligns with the T category. The mention of Nascar being interesting while on morphine is a metaphor, but the main point is the drug use. 

So, the labels T or F. Since the post is about using morphine and its effects, it's a T. The other parts are just examples of the drug's impact, but the key is the mention of drug use. So the answer should be T.
