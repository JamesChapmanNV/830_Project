Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about sports, specifically a football match between The Blades and QPR. The user mentions the team's performance, their will to win, set pieces, and comments on their chances in the PL (Premier League). There's also a hashtag #UTB, which I'm not sure about, but it might be a team or player name.

The rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, there's no mention of drugs. The conversation is about a sports game, team performance, and maybe some team-related topics. The hashtags are related to sports (Playoffs, PL). The user is discussing the team's efforts and their chances in the league. There's no slang, no mention of drug use, seeking, buying, etc. The only possible thing is the #UTB, but without more context, it's unclear. However, given the content, it's all about sports and team performance. So, there's no indication of drug-related content here. Therefore, the label should be F.
