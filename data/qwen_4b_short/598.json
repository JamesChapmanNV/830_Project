Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says, "I had my gall bladder removed in '07. There was a post-op mix up resulting in the nurses administering too much morphine and it was fucking fantastic." The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, or F for other cases like medical discussions, news, etc.

First, I need to determine if this post is about drug use. The main event here is a medical procedureâ€”gall bladder removal. The key part is the post-op mix-up where too much morphine was given. Morphine is a strong opioid, typically used for pain management. The person is talking about receiving an overdose of morphine during surgery, which is a medical situation. They describe it as "fucking fantastic," which is a strong expression of satisfaction, but the actual content is about a medical error leading to an overdose.

Now, the label rules: T is for drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang). F is for other cases. The post isn't about using drugs, but rather a medical incident involving an overdose of a medication (morphine) that's used medically. The person isn't using drugs; they were a patient who received an overdose during surgery. The use of "fucking fantastic" is a metaphor or expression of relief, not actual drug use. So, this would fall under F because it's a medical discussion about a drug-related incident, not illicit drug use. The key is whether the post is about using drugs illegally. Since the morphine was administered in a medical context, even though it was in excess, it's not considered illicit drug use here. Therefore, the label should be F.
