Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a case where a guy with an IQ of 69 was executed for smuggling 42g of heroin. The user is asking why the government isn't doing more about drug lords.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key terms here are "smuggling 42g of heroin" and "drug lords." Heroin is an illicit drug, and smuggling is trafficking. The mention of drug lords implies involvement in drug trafficking. The post is discussing a case related to drug smuggling and the legal system's response. 

The user is questioning the government's actions, but the main content is about the drug-related crime. The term "drug lords" refers to individuals involved in drug trafficking. So, according to the rules, this would be a T because it's discussing drug trafficking and related issues. The other parts are about the legal process and government response, but the core issue is drug-related. Therefore, the label should be T.
