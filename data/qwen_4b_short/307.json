Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Happy 4/20. Blaze it, then fork over some dough to help get folks imprisoned on cannabis-related charges clemency and rebuild their lives."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the first part is "Happy 4/20." That's a reference to April 20th, which is a day associated with cannabis culture, often linked to marijuana use. The phrase "Blaze it" is a slang term for smoking marijuana. So that's a clear indicator of drug use. 

Then the next part: "fork over some dough to help get folks imprisoned on cannabis-related charges clemency and rebuild their lives." The mention of "clemency" relates to pardons or forgiveness for people convicted of cannabis-related crimes. The phrase "fork over some dough" is a colloquial way of saying to pay money, which might be part of a fundraiser or a campaign. However, the main focus here is on the cannabis-related charges and the clemency. 

But the key here is whether the post is about drug use. The first part is definitely about drug use ("Blaze it"), which is slang for using marijuana. The second part is about supporting clemency for cannabis-related charges, which is a policy or advocacy topic. However, the initial part is about drug use, so even if the rest is about policy, the presence of the drug slang ("Blaze it") would make the entire post fall under T. 

Wait, but the rules say T is when the text shows drug use. The post includes both drug use (Blaze it) and a policy discussion (clemency). But the rules might consider that if any part of the text is about drug use, then it's T. Alternatively, maybe the policy part is not drug use. Let me check the rules again: T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So if the post includes any of those elements, it's T. 

The phrase "Blaze it" is definitely slang for using drugs (marijuana). Therefore, even if the rest of the post is about policy, the presence of the drug slang makes it T. The other part about clemency is a policy discussion, but the initial part is about drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
