Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Revenge isekai's are dumb as shit. If I wanted to get revenge on a kingdom I'd just invent crack."

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the main parts are talking about revenge in the context of an isekai (a genre of fantasy anime/manga where the protagonist is reincarnated). The user says "If I wanted to get revenge on a kingdom I'd just invent crack." The key part here is "invent crack." Crack is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. 

So, the phrase "invent crack" directly mentions the drug. Even though it's in a hypothetical or metaphorical context (revenge on a kingdom), the mention of crack as a drug would still fall under T because it's referring to the actual drug. The user isn't discussing medical uses, policy, or discouraging use. They're using the drug as a method for revenge, which is a form of drug use. 

I need to check if there's any other part of the post that might be a metaphor. The first part about isekai is a genre reference, but the second part is the key. The word "crack" here is a slang term for the drug, so it's a direct reference to illicit drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
