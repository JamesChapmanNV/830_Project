Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as either T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a new report on addiction treatment by respected colleagues, mentioning that additional funding hasn't reduced overdose deaths.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key words here are "addiction treatment" and "overdose deaths." The post is discussing a report on treatment programs and their effectiveness. The statement about funding not leading to a decrease in overdose deaths is a commentary on the effectiveness of current programs, not directly about drug use itself. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or specific drug slang. The focus is on treatment and funding, which falls under F as per the rules. So the label should be F.
