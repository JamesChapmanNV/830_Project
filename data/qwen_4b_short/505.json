Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is a conversation between two white guys and a white girl talking about heroin and Flo Milli's music. 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "heroin" and "Flo Milli's most popular songs." The mention of heroin is a direct reference to an illicit drug. However, the context seems to be a conversation where they're discussing heroin in a humorous or metaphorical way, maybe referencing a song or a cultural reference. 

But wait, the rules state that T includes any text that shows drug use, including slang. The mention of heroin is a direct reference to the drug. Even if it's part of a conversation or a metaphor, the presence of the drug name itself would trigger the T label. However, I need to check if there's any other context that might indicate it's not about actual drug use. 

Looking at the rest of the post: the white girl is talking about Flo Milli's songs, and the guys are reciting "beef flo mix." The humor here might be a reference to a song title or a meme. But the mention of heroin is still there. The question is whether the text is showing drug use. Since heroin is an illicit drug, even if it's part of a conversation, the presence of the term "heroin" would make it a T. 

But wait, the user's instruction says that T is for text that shows drug use, including slang. So even if it's part of a metaphor or a joke, if the drug is mentioned, it's T. The other part about Flo Milli's songs might be a red herring, but the heroin is the key here. 

So the answer should be T because the text mentions heroin, which is an illicit drug. The rest of the conversation is about music, but the presence of heroin makes it T.
