Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking me to determine if the given social media post falls under category T (indicating illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). The post says: "Yall wanna be rich and famous and be influencers but for what? Look at them they are so lost they die of suicide or drug overdose."

First, I need to check if there's any direct mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key phrases here are "die of suicide or drug overdose." The word "drug overdose" is a clear indicator of drug use. The mention of overdose directly relates to the use of drugs, which falls under T. Even though the context is about influencers being lost and dying, the explicit mention of drug overdose is a strong sign of T. The rest of the post is more about the consequences of being an influencer, but the presence of "drug overdose" makes it a T. So the label should be T.
