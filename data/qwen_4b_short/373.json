Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about "Bodyworks: Tools of the Trade: morphine" and mentions "rival bodyworks," "ash and piss," and references to death connected to the deceased's hand. The bell tolling for the coldest hour and B8 at the end.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The term "morphine" is definitely a drug, specifically an opioid. So that's a direct mention of a drug. Then there's "ash and piss" which is a slang term for drugs. I remember that "ash" can refer to drug use, like in "ash and piss" being a term for heroin or other drugs. Also, the context of "bodyworks" might be referring to things like drug dealing or related activities. The mention of "resurrectionist" could be related to body handling, maybe in a drug context. The part about "a memory of death connected to the deceased's hand" might be metaphorical, but the presence of morphine and the slang term "ash and piss" are clear indicators of drug use. The bell tolling for the coldest hour is a metaphor, but the key here is the explicit drug references. So the label should be T because it's showing drug use through the mention of morphine and the slang term.
