Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "idiot Teenage drug dealer hid 58 wraps of heroin internally to outwit police".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if there's using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the main subject is a teenage drug dealer. The key part here is "hid 58 wraps of heroin internally". Heroin is an illicit drug, and hiding it internally would be related to trafficking or dealing. The term "drug dealer" directly points to selling or trafficking drugs. 

The word "heroin" is a slang term for a drug, so that's a clear indicator. The action of hiding it internally is part of the trafficking process. Even though the first word is "idiot", that's just an insult and doesn't relate to drug use. The rest of the sentence is about the dealer's actions involving drugs. 

So according to the rules, since there's mention of heroin (a drug) and the act of trafficking (hiding it to outwit police), this should be labeled T. The other parts like "idiot" are just context but don't affect the label as they don't relate to drug use. Therefore, the answer is T.
