Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "Na it's even between him and Provorov. Provorov is going to be a problem". The options are T for text showing drug use or related terms, and F for other cases.

First, I need to check if there are any drug-related terms here. The words "Provorov" and "him" are mentioned. Provorov could be a person's name, maybe a nickname or a reference to someone. The phrase "going to be a problem" is a bit vague. But the key is to see if there's any slang, mention of using, buying, selling, trafficking, or illicit drugs.

Looking at the words: "Na" is probably a typo or a slang, but in some contexts, it could be "No" or "Na" as in "na na na" but not sure. However, the main part is "Provorov is going to be a problem". There's no direct mention of drugs here. The term "Provorov" might be a name, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, in the context of drug abuse moderation, the label is about whether the text shows drug use. Since there's no mention of drugs, slang, or related activities, it's likely F. Unless "Provorov" is a slang term for a drug, but that's not common. So the answer should be F.
