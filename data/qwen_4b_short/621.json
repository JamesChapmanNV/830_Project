Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is from a defense, quoting Dr. Baker's autopsy report. The key points here are the mention of "FATAL levels of drugs in his system" and the effect on his lungs, tripling their weight. 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The term "FATAL levels of drugs" directly refers to the presence of drugs in the body at a lethal dose. The mention of drugs causing the lungs to fill with water and tripling their weight is likely describing the physiological effects of drug overdose, which is a direct result of drug use. 

The label rules state that T includes any text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, the autopsy report is stating that the drugs were present in lethal amounts, which is a clear indication of drug use leading to a fatal outcome. The defense is using this information to argue about the cause of death, which is related to drug abuse. 

The other option, F, is for medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. However, this post is not a metaphor. It's a factual statement from an autopsy report, but the content is about drug levels leading to death. The mention of "FATAL levels" and the physiological effects are directly related to drug use. 

Therefore, the correct label should be T because the text is discussing the presence of drugs in the body at lethal levels, which is a clear case of illicit drug use leading to a fatal outcome.
