Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "crazy how people really considered doing heroin... AND DID IT." 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "heroin" and the actions "considered doing" and "DID IT." Heroin is definitely an illicit drug. The phrase "considered doing" might be a bit ambiguous, but the follow-up "AND DID IT" clearly indicates that the person actually used heroin. The use of "did it" in this context is a common slang for using drugs, especially heroin. 

So, the post is talking about someone who considered using heroin and then actually did it. That's a direct reference to drug use. There's no mention of medical use, policy, news, or metaphors here. The focus is on the action of using heroin. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled T because it directly references drug use.
