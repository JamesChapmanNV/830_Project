Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking to determine if the given social media post falls under T (illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). The post is: "Everywhere we go we clean, she wants me to quit that lean, baby I can't quit that lean, put a ring around codeineðŸ˜›".

First, I need to break down the phrases. The mention of "lean" could be a slang term. I remember that "lean" is a slang term for a concentrated form of methamphetamine, often used in drug circles. Then there's "codeine," which is an opioid, a controlled substance. The line "put a ring around codeine" might be a reference to a slang term for using codeine, possibly in a metaphorical sense, but given the context, it's likely referring to using the drug.

The phrase "she wants me to quit that lean" suggests that the person is trying to stop using "lean," which is a drug. The repetition of "can't quit that lean" reinforces the idea of ongoing drug use. The mention of codeine directly names a drug. Even though there's a smiley face at the end, that doesn't change the content of the post. The key here is whether the post is showing illicit drug use. Since "lean" and "codeine" are both drugs, and the post talks about using them, it's clearly T. The other parts like "clean" might refer to cleaning up after using drugs, but the main focus is on the drug use. So the label should be T.
