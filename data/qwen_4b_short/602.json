Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F. The post is about a music video titled "Angel Of Small Death & The Codeine Scene" by Hozier. The label rules are T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drugs. The title includes "Codeine," which is a controlled substance, a type of opioid. But is "Codeine" considered slang here? Well, codeine is a real drug, but in the context of a music video title, it might be part of the artwork or a metaphor. However, the label rules include slang for drugs. But codeine is a specific drug, not necessarily slang. Wait, but the title is "The Codeine Scene." The word "scene" here could be part of the title, but does it imply drug use?

Alternatively, maybe the music video's title is referencing codeine, which is a drug. But the post itself is just mentioning the music video. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the text shows drug use, it's T. But the post doesn't explicitly state that someone is using codeine. It's just the title of the music video. So, does the title count as showing drug use? The rules mention "slang for drugs," but codeine is a specific drug, not slang. Unless the title is using "codeine" as a metaphor or part of the song's theme. But without more context, the post is just a reference to the music video. 

The label rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use." If the text is just mentioning the title of a music video that includes the word "codeine," does that count as showing drug use? Maybe not directly. Unless the music video is about drug use. But the post itself is just the title. So maybe it's F, because it's not explicitly showing drug use, but rather referencing a music video that might have drug-related themes. But the label rules are strict. The user is supposed to check if the text itself shows drug use. Since the post is just the title, and codeine is a drug, but the post isn't stating that someone is using it. It's just a reference. So maybe F. However, if the title is part of the text, and codeine is a drug, perhaps it's T. But I'm not sure. The key is whether the text shows drug use. The title is "The Codeine Scene." If the music video is about codeine, then maybe it's T. But the post itself is just the title. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the text is about a music video that includes drug use, but the text itself doesn't mention it, then maybe it's F. But the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use." So if the text is the title of a music video that includes codeine, does that count? Hmm. Maybe the answer is F because the post doesn't explicitly state that someone is using codeine. It's just a reference. So the correct label would be F.
