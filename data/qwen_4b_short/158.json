Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone who got sober, didn't have a phone, worked with their dad who's an alcoholic. The person couldn't call their sponsor and relied on their dad. Then, one day, they said they wanted to use heroin and their dad responded with a harsh comment.

First, I need to check if the post contains any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "heroin" and the context of wanting to use it. The user mentions "use heroin rn" which is a direct reference to drug use. Even though the dad's reaction is a metaphorical or emotional response, the actual mention of heroin is a clear indicator of drug use. 

The label rules state that T is for any text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. The post explicitly states the desire to use heroin, which is a controlled substance. The dad's response is a reaction, but the main point is the mention of heroin. Therefore, this should be labeled T. The other parts of the post are about sobriety and family, but the mention of heroin is the key factor here. So the answer is T.
