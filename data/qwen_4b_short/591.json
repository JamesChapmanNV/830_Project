Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Nigerian drug dealer sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in India". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "drug dealer" and "sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in India". The main subject is a Nigerian drug dealer who was sentenced in India. The post is reporting on a legal case related to drug trafficking. 

Now, the question is whether this falls under T or F. The label T is for instances where the text directly mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Here, the post is about a drug dealer being sentenced, which relates to trafficking. However, the post itself is a news report about a legal case, not a personal account of someone using drugs. 

The rules specify that T includes trafficking. So even though it's a news story, the mention of a drug dealer being sentenced for trafficking would be considered T. But wait, the label rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use". The post is reporting on a crime, not the act of using drugs. The person is a dealer, so trafficking is involved. 

But the label T is for when the text shows drug use. So if the post is about someone being sentenced for trafficking, does that count as T? The rules say "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs". So trafficking is included. Therefore, the post is about a drug dealer (selling drugs), so it's T. 

But wait, the post is a news article about a legal case. The user is moderating social media posts. The question is whether the post itself is showing drug use. The post is reporting on a drug dealer's sentencing, which is related to trafficking. So according to the rules, since trafficking is part of T, this should be labeled T. 

But I need to check again. The label T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post is not about someone using drugs, but about a dealer being punished for trafficking. However, the act of trafficking is part of the drug use context. Therefore, the post is related to drug trafficking, so it's T. 

Alternatively, if the post is just reporting on a legal case, maybe it's F. But according to the rules, trafficking is included in T. Therefore, the correct label is T.
