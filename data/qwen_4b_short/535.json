Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "IF YOUR A CRACKHEAD! AND SMOKING CRACK. YOU AINT SLEEPING."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The word "crackhead" is a slang term for someone who uses crack cocaine heavily, which is an illicit drug. The mention of "smoking crack" directly refers to the use of crack cocaine. 

The phrase "YOU AINT SLEEPING" might be a consequence of using crack, but the key here is whether the text explicitly shows drug use. Since "crackhead" and "smoking crack" are clear indicators of drug use, the label should be T. The other parts of the post are more about the effects of the drug, but the presence of the slang and direct mention of the drug itself makes it a T. 

I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. The post is clearly about drug use, so the answer is T.
