Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "I want 3 things in life Bronte To be small and skinny To be able to make better music". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, the person is listing three things they want in life. The first is being small and skinny, which seems like a personal goal. The second is making better music. There's no mention of drugs here. The name Bronte might be a reference to the author BrontÃ«, but that's not relevant here. 

I don't see any words related to drugs, drug use, or any slang that could indicate drug abuse. The content is about personal aspirations. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's not related to drug use. The user might be testing if I can distinguish between personal goals and drug-related content. 

No metaphors or hidden meanings that point to drugs. The answer is F.
