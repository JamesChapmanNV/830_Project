Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight, percocet and codeine please don't take my life."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let me break down the post.

The first part is "birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight." That seems like a metaphor or a song reference. Brian McKnight is a singer, so maybe the person is referencing a song. Then "percocet and codeine" are both drugs. Percocet is a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen, which is a controlled substance. Codeine is also a controlled drug, often used in medications. The last part is "please don't take my life," which is a plea, but the key part here is the mention of percocet and codeine.

So, the post explicitly mentions two drugs: percocet and codeine. According to the rules, any mention of these would fall under T. Even if the rest of the post is metaphorical, the presence of the drug names would trigger the T label. The user is asking for a label, so I need to make sure that even if there's a metaphor, the actual drug names are present. The answer should be T because the post includes specific drugs. The other parts might be metaphorical, but the presence of the drug names makes it T.
