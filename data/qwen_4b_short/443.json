Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about a drug overdose, but the person mentions that the person in question has been clean for years. They also talk about the attorney not fact-checking the information before releasing it.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "drug overdose." But the person is saying that the person was clean, so maybe they're referring to someone else? The post is about the attorney's failure to fact-check, not about the person using drugs. 

The rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post doesn't mention any of these actions. It's more about the attorney's mistake and the person's long-term sobriety. There's no mention of drug use, seeking, or related activities. The term "drug overdose" is used, but that's a medical term, not necessarily indicating current use. 

So, the label should be F because it's not about drug use but rather a critique of the attorney's actions. The mention of overdose is part of a medical context, not indicating current or past use. Therefore, the answer is F.
