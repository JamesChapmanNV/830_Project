Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Vancouver funds permanent position to lead overdose response team". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, it's talking about Vancouver funding a permanent position to lead an overdose response team. The key words here are "overdose response team". Overdose is related to drug use, but the post is about funding a team to respond to overdoses, which is a public health measure. It's not directly mentioning drug use, but rather the response to it. 

Now, I need to check if this falls under T or F. The rules say T includes things like seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention any of these activities. It's more about funding a team to handle overdoses, which is a policy or medical discussion. So this would be under F. 

Wait, but is there any slang or indirect reference? The word "overdose" is related to drug use, but the post is about responding to overdoses, not using drugs. The main topic is about funding and policy, not the act of using or dealing with drugs. Therefore, it's F.
