Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Still waiting on the Codeine Crazy Future to come back üò©üçá Goat".

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "Codeine" and "Crazy Future". Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medications, but it's also classified as an illicit drug in some contexts. The term "Crazy Future" might be a slang or a metaphor. 

The rules specify that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So, "Codeine" is a drug, so that's a red flag. The phrase "Crazy Future" could be a slang term, but I'm not sure. However, the presence of "Codeine" alone might be enough. The emojis are just expressive and don't relate to the content. The user is waiting for something to come back, which might be a metaphor, but the main term is Codeine. So, I think this should be labeled T.
