Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Shameful - taking money from Danny Kinahan, while the cunts flooding Ireland with heroin as people like me were trying to stop it."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the main elements are "taking money from Danny Kinahan" and "flooding Ireland with heroin." The word "heroin" is a direct reference to an illicit drug. The phrase "flooding Ireland with heroin" indicates the act of distributing or supplying heroin, which is trafficking. The mention of Danny Kinahan might be a reference to a person involved in drug trafficking, but the key part here is the heroin being flooded into Ireland.

The user is talking about people like them trying to stop it, which is a metaphorical statement, but the actual drug use here is heroin. The term "cunts" is used, which is offensive language, but it's not related to drug use. The main point is the act of flooding Ireland with heroin, which is trafficking. 

So according to the rules, any mention of trafficking (which is part of drug abuse) would be labeled T. The post clearly mentions heroin being flooded into Ireland, which is drug trafficking. Therefore, the label should be T.
