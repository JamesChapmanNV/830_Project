Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post mentions King George V being euthanized by his doctor with a lethal dose of morphine and cocaine, according to a documentary. The user is moderating posts related to drug abuse.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are morphine and cocaine. Both are classified as illicit drugs. The post states that he was euthanized using these drugs, which implies their use in a medical context. However, the question is whether this counts as showing drug use. 

The rules specify that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Euthanasia with morphine and cocaine would involve the use of these drugs. But wait, morphine is sometimes used in medical settings for pain relief, so maybe that's a medical use. However, the post is about a historical event where he was euthanized, which might be considered a form of drug use. But the label rules also include medical discussions. However, the post is not just discussing medical use but rather the use of drugs in the context of euthanasia. 

But the user's instruction says to label T if it shows drug use, even if it's medical. Wait, the rules say T is for illicit or abusive use. So if it's a medical use, maybe it's F. But the problem is that morphine and cocaine are both drugs that can be considered illicit. However, in this case, they were used in a medical context. But the label rules might not distinguish between medical and illicit. Wait, the rules state that T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the text is about using drugs, even in a medical context, it's T? Or is medical use considered F?

Wait, the label rules say F is all other cases, including medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor. So if the post is about the historical use of drugs in a medical context (euthanasia), then it might be F. But the problem is that the post is not just discussing medical use, but the actual use of drugs (morphine and cocaine) in a procedure. However, the rules might consider that as T because it's about the use of drugs. But the rules say that F includes medical discussion. So maybe this is a medical use, so F. But the post is about the use of drugs in a medical procedure, so maybe F. However, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so maybe even medical use is considered T. Wait, the rules are a bit ambiguous here. Let me check again.

The label rules: T is text that shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F is all other cases, including medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

So the post is about the use of morphine and cocaine in a historical context. The key is whether this is considered "illicit or abusive drug use." If the use was in a medical context (euthanasia), maybe it's considered medical, so F. But if the use is for euthanasia, which is a form of drug use, perhaps it's T. But the rules say that F includes medical discussion. So maybe this is F. However, the post is not just discussing medical use but the actual use of drugs. But the rules might consider that as T. Wait, the example in the rules: "discouraging use" is F. So if the post is about the use of drugs in a medical context, is that considered T or F? The rules say F includes medical discussion. So maybe this is F. But the post is not just discussing medical use, but the actual use of drugs. However, the label is for drug abuse. So maybe if it's a historical event, it's F. Alternatively, if the post is about the use of drugs (morphine and cocaine) in a medical procedure, maybe it's T. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The answer might depend on whether the use is considered illicit. Since morphine and cocaine are both drugs that can be considered illicit, but in this case, they were used in a medical context. However, the rules don't specify whether medical use is considered T or F. The rules say F includes medical/policy discussion. So if the post is a discussion about the medical use of drugs, then it's F. But the post is about the use of drugs in a specific historical event. Therefore, the answer might be T because it's showing the use of drugs (morphine and cocaine) in a context that's not necessarily medical, but rather a form of euthanasia. Wait, but the user is moderating for drug abuse. So if the post is about the use of drugs in a medical procedure, maybe it's F. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fact that it's a historical event and the drugs were used in a medical context might make it F. Therefore, the label would be F. But I need to check again. The post is about the use of drugs (morphine and cocaine) in a procedure. The rules say T is for using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. So if the text is about using drugs, even in a medical context, it's T. But the rules say F includes medical discussion. So maybe the answer is T because it's about the use of drugs. However, the rules might have exceptions. Wait, the user is moderating for drug abuse. So if the post is about the use of drugs in a medical context, but not for abuse, then it's F. But the post is not about abuse, but about a historical event where drugs were used. Therefore, the answer is F. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the use of morphine and cocaine in this case is considered a form of drug use, so T. But the rules might consider that as F because it's a medical use. So I think the answer is F.
