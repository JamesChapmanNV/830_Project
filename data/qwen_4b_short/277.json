Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking to determine if the given social media post falls under category T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). The post is: "I'll be friends with a nigga who deals CRACK before I'm friends with a fent dealer".

First, I need to break down the key terms here. The user mentions "deals CRACK" and "fent dealer". Let's start with "CRACK". Crack is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is a highly addictive illicit drug. So "deals CRACK" clearly refers to someone involved in selling or distributing crack cocaine. That's a direct reference to drug trafficking or selling, which is part of the T category.

Next, "fent dealer". "Fent" is a slang term for fentanyl, another powerful and illegal opioid. So "fent dealer" would mean someone who deals in fentanyl. Again, this is directly related to drug trafficking or selling, which is T.

The phrase "I'll be friends with a nigga who deals..." is a statement about choosing to be friends with someone involved in drug dealing. The use of "nigga" is a racial slur, but the main point here is the drug dealing aspect. The post is not just about the drug itself but about the act of dealing, which is part of the T category.

Now, checking the label rules again. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post is about someone dealing (selling) crack and fentanyl, which are both illicit drugs. The mention of "deals" is key here. Even though the post is a personal statement, the content is about drug dealing, which is T.

Are there any other elements? The user is comparing being friends with a crack dealer versus a fentanyl dealer. The focus is on the drug dealing activity, not on personal use or medical discussion. So it's definitely T.

I don't see any other context that would fall under F. The post is not about medical advice, policy, news, or discouraging use. It's about associating with drug dealers, which is directly related to drug trafficking. Therefore, the correct label should be T.
