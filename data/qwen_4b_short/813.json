Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Now I'm on ocean drive sippin codeine w/the top down 20grand on me, lotta jewelry n a glock 9".

First, I need to check if the text mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "codeine". Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug in many contexts. The user is using the term "sippin" which is slang for drinking, so "sippin codeine" indicates consuming the drug. 

Next, the other parts of the post mention "20grand on me" which might refer to money, and "lotta jewelry n a glock 9" which is about possessions, but those don't relate to drug use. The location "ocean drive" is just a place, not related. 

The rules state that T is for any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since "codeine" is a drug and "sippin" is slang for consumption, this fits under T. The other parts are just about material possessions, so they don't affect the label. 

I should make sure there's no other hidden meaning or metaphor. The post seems straightforward. No medical discussion or policy talk here. The user is clearly stating they are using codeine. So the label should be T.
