Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about the Indian Coast Guard and ATS capturing a Pakistani ship with heroin. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any of those drug-related activities. The post says they captured a ship with heroin worth 280 crores. Heroin is an illicit drug, and the context is a law enforcement operation. The ship was carrying heroin, which is a drug. So the text is reporting on the trafficking of heroin. 

The key here is whether the post is directly showing drug use. Since the ship was caught with heroin, that's trafficking, which is part of the T category. The post is about capturing a ship that was transporting drugs, so it's showing drug trafficking. Therefore, the label should be T. 

I need to make sure there's no other context that might make it F. The post is a news report about a law enforcement action, but the content itself is about the capture of drugs. So according to the rules, this is T.
