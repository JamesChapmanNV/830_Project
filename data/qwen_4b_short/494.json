Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about the speaker's sister-in-law and her friends, mentioning they're all drinking wine. The wife is described as looking like her Filipina mom.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The post talks about people drinking wine, which is alcohol, not a drug. The terms "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs" are the key here. The word "drinking" is used, but wine is a beverage, not a drug. There's no mention of drugs, slang, or any activities related to drug abuse. The part about the wife's appearance doesn't relate to drugs either. So, there's no indication of T here. The rest of the post is about social media content, friends, and appearance, which falls under F. Therefore, the label should be F.
