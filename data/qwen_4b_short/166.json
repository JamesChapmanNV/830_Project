Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Currently Playing: Venus Blake - Chocolate Morphine, at Lonely Oak radio".

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules say T if the text shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise.

Looking at the post, the song title is "Chocolate Morphine". Morphine is a potent opioid, which is an illicit drug. But is "Chocolate Morphine" a slang term here? Maybe the song title is using "morphine" as part of the title, but does that indicate actual drug use? The artist is Venus Blake, and the radio station is Lonely Oak. The phrase "Currently Playing" suggests it's a music track. 

But wait, "Morphine" is a drug, so if the song's title includes it, does that count as showing drug use? The rules mention slang for drugs. However, the title might be a metaphor or just a song title. But the problem is whether the text shows drug use. If the song title is "Chocolate Morphine", that could be a reference to the drug, but maybe it's just a creative title. However, the presence of "Morphine" in the title might be considered as slang or a reference to drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing if "Morphine" in the title is considered a drug. Since Morphine is a controlled substance, using it in a song title could be seen as showing drug use. But the rules specify that T is when the text shows drug use. So if the title is "Chocolate Morphine", does that count as showing drug use? 

Alternatively, maybe it's a metaphor. But the rules don't mention metaphors as F. The label F is for all other cases, including medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor. So if the song title is using the word "morphine" as part of the title, even if it's a song title, does that count as showing drug use? 

Wait, the rules say "text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs)". So if the text includes the slang or the drug name, then it's T. So "Morphine" is a drug, so if the text includes that, it's T. Therefore, the label should be T. But maybe the song title is not directly indicating use but just a name. However, the rules might consider the presence of the drug name as showing drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is trying to trick me. But according to the rules, any mention of the drug name would be T. So "Chocolate Morphine" would be T because "Morphine" is a drug. Therefore, the label is T.
