Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Report: Rolando McClain struggling with codeine addiction, has gained 40 pounds Bad News #RTR ðŸ…°".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "codeine addiction" and "struggling with". Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medical contexts but also misused. The mention of addiction directly points to drug use. The phrase "struggling with" indicates that someone is using the drug, which fits the T category. The other part about gaining 40 pounds might be a result of the addiction, but the main focus here is on the addiction itself. The hashtag #RTR might be related to a specific group or movement, but the main content is about codeine addiction. Since codeine is an illicit drug in some contexts and the post mentions addiction, this should be labeled T. The other cases would be if it's about medical advice, news, or metaphor, but here it's clearly about drug use. So the answer is T.
