Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is from someone who's a medical cannabis advocate. They mention sharing their creations to encourage others to try medical cannabis. They also talk about it being cheaper to make their own edibles and the effects lasting longer than smoking or vaping.

First, I need to check the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

The post is about medical cannabis, which is a controlled substance but used medicinally. The person is advocating for it, sharing their own edibles. They mention making their own, which could relate to production. However, the key here is whether the post is about illicit drug use. Since they're talking about medical use, it's more of a medical/policy discussion. The terms used are "medical cannabis," "edibles," and discussing benefits like cost and duration of effects. There's no mention of illegal activities, slang, or promoting abuse. The advocacy is for medical use, so it's F. The answer should be F.
