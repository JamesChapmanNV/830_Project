Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about being sick of looking at illegal cannabis drugs and failed breathalyzers from the Gardai (Irish police) on Twitter. There's also mention of a Garda out for a cycle in the Wicklow mountains and wanting more dogs to check people.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key terms here are "illegal cannabis drugs" and "failed breathalyzers." The term "cannabis drugs" directly relates to drug use. The mention of Gardai (police) and breathalyzers might be about drug testing, but the main focus here is on the illegal cannabis. 

The user is expressing frustration about seeing these things on social media. The phrase "looking at illegal cannabis drugs" clearly falls under T because it's about illicit drug use. Even though there's a mention of police and breathalyzers, the primary subject is the cannabis, which is a drug. The part about dogs might be referring to drug detection dogs, but that's more about enforcement rather than the use itself. 

The rules say T if it's about drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention seeking or buying, but it does mention "illegal cannabis drugs," which is using. So the label should be T. The rest of the post is about police and dogs, which are F unless they're directly related to drug use. Since the main subject is the cannabis, the answer is T.
