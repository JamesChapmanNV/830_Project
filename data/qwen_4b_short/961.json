Okay, let's see. The user is moderating social media posts related to drug abuse. The task is to label each post as T or F based on specific rules. The post in question is: "wdw pls stop going live at the crack of dawn or while i'm working thank youu ðŸ˜‚". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for text that mentions using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The label F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: The user is addressing someone named "wdw" (maybe a username or a person's name) and asking them to stop going live at the crack of dawn or while the user is working. The message is about scheduling live streams, possibly related to a streaming platform or a content creator. The user is asking for the other person to stop doing something at certain times. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any related terms. The emojis are just a smiley face, which is probably just for tone.

So, the key here is whether there's any reference to drugs. The words "crack of dawn" might be a metaphor, but "crack" here refers to the time of day, not the drug. The user isn't talking about using drugs, seeking them, buying, selling, or any slang. The request is about scheduling, not drug-related activities. Therefore, this post doesn't meet the criteria for T. It's more about a personal request regarding live streaming times, which falls under F.
