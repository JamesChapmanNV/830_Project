Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about the user's uncle's girlfriend who died from a painful death with morphine, and the user is afraid their grandma might go through the same thing.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use. The key terms here are "morphine," which is a medical drug, but the context is about a prolonged, painful death. The user is expressing fear about their grandma's potential experience. 

The label rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

In this case, the post is talking about morphine use in a medical context. The user is not discussing the use of drugs in a slang or illicit way. They're talking about a medical treatment (morphine for pain) and the outcome. The fear is about a medical condition, not about drug abuse or illicit use. So even though morphine is a drug, it's being used medically here. The post isn't about drug abuse or seeking, but rather a medical scenario. Therefore, it should be labeled F.
