Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Forensic pathologist ruled out drug overdose as Floyd's cause of death". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post mentions a forensic pathologist ruling out drug overdose as the cause of death. The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use or not. The phrase "ruled out drug overdose" is a medical or legal statement about the cause of death. It's not stating that someone is using drugs, but rather that the cause was determined to be something else. 

So, the post is reporting on a medical finding, not directly discussing drug use. There's no mention of someone using drugs, seeking them, buying, selling, etc. The term "drug overdose" is part of the medical terminology here, not slang or a metaphor. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F because it's a medical/policy discussion or news related to the cause of death, not showing drug use.
