Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Thinking about the amount of people who would read this and think 'obviously the royal prince goes to heaven and the gangbanger who died of an overdose does not' is depressing."

First, I need to check if this post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key part here is "gangbanger who died of an overdose." Overdose is directly related to drug use. The term "gangbanger" might imply involvement in drug-related activities, but the main point here is the overdose. 

The post is talking about people's reactions to the idea that a gangbanger who overdosed doesn't go to heaven. The mention of overdose is a clear indicator of drug use. Even though the post is more about people's perceptions and the emotional impact, the presence of "overdose" falls under drug abuse. 

So according to the rules, T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. Since the post mentions overdose, which is a direct result of drug use, it should be labeled T. The other parts of the post are about people's thoughts and the depressing nature of it, but the key element here is the overdose, which is a drug-related death. Therefore, the correct label is T.
