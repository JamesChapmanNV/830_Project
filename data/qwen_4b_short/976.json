Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Hi Scarlett, very sorry to hear your I'll again. üôÅ Get well soon. At least the morphine should make you feel high. ü§ì I need to get some strong cigars to get spaced out."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Let's break down the post.

The first part is a greeting and an apology. Then "your I'll again" might be a typo for "ill again," which is about being sick. Then "Get well soon." Then "At least the morphine should make you feel high." Morphine is a drug, but it's a medical one, used for pain relief. However, the phrase "make you feel high" is a slang term. Morphine can cause drowsiness or euphoria, but is that considered slang for drug use here?

Next, "I need to get some strong cigars to get spaced out." "Spaced out" is a slang term for being high, often associated with drugs like marijuana. "Strong cigars" might be a reference to something else, but the key is "spaced out," which is a slang for drug use.

So, the post mentions morphine (a drug) and "spaced out" (slang for drug use). Even though morphine is a medical drug, the context here is about feeling high, which is a slang term. Also, "spaced out" is a clear indicator of drug use. Therefore, this would be T.

But wait, the user's instruction says T is when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. Morphine is a controlled substance, but it's a medical one. However, the post is using it in a way that's associated with feeling high, which could be considered slang for drug use. Also, "spaced out" is definitely slang for drugs. So the answer should be T.
