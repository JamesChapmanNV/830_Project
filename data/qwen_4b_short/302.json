Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "THIS is LITERALLY my favorite song and will forever be ðŸ˜©ðŸ’•ðŸ’• forget my other favs Codeine Crazy permanent ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’œ". 

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the text, the user mentions "Codeine Crazy". Codeine is a controlled substance, a narcotic, and is classified as a Schedule II drug in the US. It's used medically but can be abused. The term "Crazy" here might be slang, but in the context of the song title, it's likely referring to the drug. 

The user is talking about their favorite song, but the mention of Codeine is key. Even though the rest of the post is about music preferences, the presence of the drug name "Codeine" would trigger the T label. The emojis are probably just expressing emotions, but the actual content includes the drug reference. 

So, according to the rules, since the post includes the drug name Codeine, which is a slang or direct mention of an illicit drug, the label should be T. The other parts of the post don't relate to drug use, but the mention of Codeine is enough to classify it as T.
