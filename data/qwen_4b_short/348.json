Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Police struggle to get loaded AK-47 out of 10-year-old's hands in chaotic overdose investigation".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "loaded AK-47" and "overdose investigation". An AK-47 is a military-grade assault rifle, so having a loaded AK-47 in a 10-year-old's hands is definitely a sign of illegal possession, which is related to drug abuse. The mention of an overdose investigation might be a red herring, but the presence of the weapon suggests that the child might be involved in drug-related activities. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, the AK-47 is part of the context of drug abuse, even if it's not directly a drug. So, the label should be T. Wait, but the overdose partâ€”maybe that's a separate issue. However, the presence of the weapon is a direct indicator of drug-related abuse. So T is correct.
