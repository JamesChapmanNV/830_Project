Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone who's frustrated because others who mentioned "drug overdose" moved on without retracting their statements or apologizing. They're asking if anyone has seen the truth from people on the app.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "drug overdose," which is a direct reference to drug use. The user is talking about people who said "drug overdose" and then moved on without retracting. But the question is whether the post itself contains any drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang.

The post doesn't explicitly mention using drugs, but it's discussing people who have made statements about drug overdoses. However, the main point here is that the user is criticizing others for not retracting their statements. The post itself doesn't state that the user is using drugs or discussing their own use. It's more about others' actions. 

The rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. Since the post is about others' statements and not the user's own drug use, it's more of a discussion about medical or policy topics. The user is talking about retractions and apologies, which are related to medical discussions or policy. Therefore, the label should be F. 

Wait, but "drug overdose" is a medical term, but the user is talking about people who said that and moved on. However, the post itself doesn't show the user using drugs. It's a discussion about others' statements. So, according to the rules, F is for all other cases except T. Therefore, the answer is F.
