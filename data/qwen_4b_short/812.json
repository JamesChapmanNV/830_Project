Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Ain't nothing important to me except codeine over ice noww".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention that T is for text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key words here are "codeine" and "over ice". Codeine is a controlled substance, often used as an opioid, and it's considered an illicit drug in many contexts. The phrase "over ice" might be a slang term. Wait, "over ice" could refer to a method of consuming codeine, like mixing it with ice to make it more potent, which is a common method for some drug use. Alternatively, "over ice" might be a slang term for something else, but in this context, given the mention of codeine, it's likely referring to the method of consumption.

So the post is stating that the only thing important is codeine, which is a drug, and the method of using it. That fits under T because it's directly mentioning the use of codeine, which is an illicit drug. The other part is the phrase "noww" which is just a slang for now, but the main point is the drug reference.

Therefore, the label should be T.
