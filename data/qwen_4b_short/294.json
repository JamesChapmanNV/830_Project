Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Bella Thorne in her alleged heroin addict era or Dasha."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "alleged heroin addict era." "Heroin addict" clearly refers to using heroin, which is an illicit drug. The word "alleged" might indicate that this is not confirmed, but the presence of "heroin addict" still falls under the T category because it directly mentions drug use. Even if it's alleged, the content is about drug use. The other part of the post is "or Dasha," which I'm not sure about. Dasha could be a person's name, maybe a celebrity, but it doesn't relate to drugs. So the main point here is the mention of heroin addiction. Therefore, the label should be T.
