Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post says: "Yoooo!!!! I just had sweetgreen for the first time and omfgðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ that damn crispy rice bowl is crack". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the person mentions "crispy rice bowl is crack". Wait, "crack" here is a slang term for crack cocaine. But the context is about a restaurant meal, Sweetgreen. The user is talking about a crispy rice bowl and calling it "crack". That seems like a metaphor or a slang term, not actual drug use. But I need to be careful here. 

Is "crack" being used as a slang for the drug, or is it a metaphor? The user is expressing strong emotions, maybe exaggerating or using a slang term. The key is whether the text is indicating actual drug use. The post doesn't mention using, selling, buying, or trafficking. It's more about the food being so good that they're comparing it to crack, which is a slang term for the drug. 

But the rules say T if it's slang for drugs. So if "crack" is being used as a slang term here, then it would be T. However, the user might be using "crack" metaphorically to express how good the food is, similar to how some people use "crack" in a non-literal way. But in this case, the person is saying the food is "crack", which is a slang term for the drug. So that would be T. 

Wait, but the user is talking about a restaurant meal, so maybe they're using "crack" in a hyperbolic way. However, the label rules include slang for drugs. So if the text uses "crack" as a slang term, it's T. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is not referring to the drug but using it as a metaphor. But the rules don't specify that. The rules are strict: if it's using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. So even if it's a metaphor, if it's using slang for drugs, then it's T. 

So in this case, "crispy rice bowl is crack" is using "crack" as a slang term for the drug. Therefore, the label should be T. But wait, the user is talking about a food item. Maybe they're not actually using the drug, but using the slang. But according to the rules, any use of slang for drugs is T. So even if it's a metaphor, the label is T. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is not referring to the drug but using it as a metaphor. But the rules don't differentiate between literal and metaphorical use. So if the text contains slang for drugs, it's T. 

Therefore, the answer should be T.
