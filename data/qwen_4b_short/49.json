Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a survey of oncologists-in-training regarding medical cannabis. The key points here are that they received no formal training on medical cannabis and felt insufficiently informed to make recommendations.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about medical cannabis, which is a medical use, not illicit. The term "medical cannabis" is used, but it's in the context of a survey about training and recommendations. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking drugs. The focus is on the lack of training and information, not on actual drug use. 

The label rules say T is for illicit or abusive drug use, and F is for other cases like medical discussions. Since the post is about medical cannabis training and not about using or dealing with drugs, it falls under F. The hashtag #medicalcannabis might be a red herring, but the content is about education and recommendations, not use. So the correct label should be F.
