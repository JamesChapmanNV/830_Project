Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about insurance coverage for drugs, specifically transmucosal fentanyl for non-cancer pain. The key here is to determine if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about transmucosal fentanyl (Actiq, Fentora), which are prescription medications. The user is discussing insurance coverage and FDA guidelines. They mention that these drugs are approved for cancer but not for non-cancer intractable pain, even though studies show effectiveness. 

The term "transmucosal fentanyl" is a medical term for a specific drug. The post is discussing medical use and insurance coverage, not personal use or abuse. There's no mention of using drugs for pleasure, seeking, buying, or trafficking. The focus is on medical approval and cost issues. 

So, the label should be F because it's a medical/policy discussion, not about drug abuse. The mention of fentanyl is in a medical context, not as slang or for illicit use. The user is talking about insurance and FDA guidelines, which falls under F.
