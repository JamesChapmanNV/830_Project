Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Chonk cat... did I just crack the enigma?" 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

So the post here is "Chonk cat... did I just crack the enigma?" Let me break it down. "Chonk cat" might be a reference to a cat that's chubby or has a certain look, maybe a meme or a term used in some context. "Crack the enigma" could be a metaphor. The phrase "crack the enigma" is often used in puzzles or riddles where you have to solve something. 

But wait, "crack" can sometimes be slang for using drugs, like "crack" as in crack cocaine. However, in this case, the user is using "crack the enigma," which seems more like a metaphor for solving a mystery or puzzle. The mention of "Chonk cat" might be part of a meme or a reference to a specific image or joke. 

I need to check if there's any direct reference to drug use. The word "crack" could be a red herring here. The main point is whether the post is about drug use. Since the user is asking if they "just crack the enigma," it's more likely a metaphorical expression rather than referring to drug use. There's no explicit mention of drugs, buying, selling, or using. 

Therefore, the label should be F because it's a metaphorical statement without any direct reference to drug abuse or illicit drug use.
