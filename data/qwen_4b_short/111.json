Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Love 3 am migraines. They are the best. Never wanted to get sick from pain before, which is nice. Codeine is awesome though."

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the person mentions "Codeine" which is a drug. Codeine is an opioid, so it's a controlled substance. The user says "Codeine is awesome though." That seems like they're talking about using codeine. But wait, is codeine considered an illicit drug? Well, codeine is a controlled substance in many places, often used in medications. However, in the context of the label rules, if it's mentioned as a drug, even if it's a prescription one, it might still be considered T if it's being used in a way that's associated with drug use.

But the user is not necessarily saying they are using it. They might be talking about codeine in a general sense, like a medication. However, the phrase "Codeine is awesome" could be seen as a positive statement about its use, which might indicate that they are using it. But the user also mentions migraines and pain, which could be a reason to use codeine. However, the key here is whether the post shows drug use. 

The term "Codeine" is a drug, and if the person is referring to using it, then that would be T. But the post doesn't explicitly say they are using codeine. They might be talking about it in a general way. However, the mention of "Codeine is awesome" could be a slang term or a way of referring to drug use. Also, the user mentions migraines and pain, which could be a reason to take codeine, which is a drug. 

But the label rules include slang for drugs. Codeine is a drug, so if they're referring to it as a drug, that's T. However, the user might not be using it but just talking about it. But the presence of the term "Codeine" in the context of being "awesome" could be considered as using it. Alternatively, the mention of migraines and codeine could be a medical context. 

Wait, the user says "Codeine is awesome though." That could be a positive comment on its use. So the post is discussing the use of codeine, which is a drug. Therefore, according to the rules, this would be T. But I need to check if the post is showing drug use. The user is not explicitly saying they are using codeine, but the mention of codeine in a positive light could be considered as using it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is talking about codeine in a medical context, like taking it for migraines. But codeine is a controlled substance, so even if it's for medical use, the label rules might still consider it as T. 

So, based on the rules, if the text shows drug use (using, seeking, buying, etc.), then it's T. The mention of codeine as a drug, even if it's for medical use, might still be considered T. Therefore, the label should be T.
