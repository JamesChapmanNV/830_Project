Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "This church deals heroin. It literally has no Biblical right to say the Holy Spirit is there. They are also cowards and backbiters like the Hess/Dedmon family."

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The first sentence says "deals heroin," which is definitely drug use. So that's a T. The rest of the post talks about the church's beliefs and character, but the key part here is the mention of heroin. Even though the rest is about the church's actions, the presence of "deals heroin" is enough to trigger the T label. The other parts are about the church's practices and the Hess/Dedmon family, but those don't relate to drug use. So the answer should be T.
