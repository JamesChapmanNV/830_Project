Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post mentions "porn dealer," "drug dealer," and "software pirate," and says these individuals have the same day job as Police Officers.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The term "drug dealer" is a key here. The rule says T if there's mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post uses "drug dealer," which directly refers to someone involved in selling drugs. That seems like a T. 

But wait, the post is talking about people who are dealers, not necessarily that the person is using drugs. However, the label rules include "selling" as part of T. So even if the person is a dealer, the act of selling is part of the T category. The post is stating that these individuals are drug dealers, which would fall under T. 

Also, the mention of "porn dealer" might be a red herring, but the main point is the "drug dealer." The other parts like "software pirate" don't relate to drugs, so they can be ignored. The key is that the text is discussing people who are involved in drug dealing, which is T. 

Therefore, the correct label should be T.
