Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Anyone near Moreno Valley area and wants a job rolling cannabis products please hit me up! Full time and maybe even overtime. AM and PM shifts!" 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "cannabis products" and "rolling". Rolling cannabis products could refer to the process of making cannabis into a product, like rolling joints or edibles. But wait, is "rolling" in this context related to drug use? If someone is working in a job that involves rolling cannabis, that might be part of the supply chain, possibly related to selling or distributing. However, the post is about hiring someone to roll cannabis products, which could be part of a business involved in cannabis production or distribution. 

But the question is whether the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post is about seeking employment in a role that involves handling cannabis products. However, the term "rolling" here might be a slang term for making cannabis products, which is part of the drug trade. If the job is in the cannabis industry, it could be related to trafficking or selling. But the post is from a job seeker's perspective, not necessarily about using drugs. 

Wait, the user is looking for someone to roll cannabis products. If the job is in a legal cannabis business, then it's not illicit. But if the business is illegal, then it's illicit. However, the post doesn't specify whether the business is legal or not. The location is Moreno Valley, which is a place where cannabis is legal in some states, but in others, it's illegal. But the label rules don't take into account the legality of the activity, just whether the text shows drug use. 

The key is whether the text is showing drug use. The post is about hiring someone to roll cannabis products. Rolling cannabis could be part of the process of making cannabis, which is a drug. But the post is about a job opportunity, not about using the drug. However, the act of rolling cannabis products might be part of the supply chain, which could be related to trafficking. 

Alternatively, if the job is in a legal cannabis business, then it's not T. But the label rules don't consider the legality, just the presence of drug-related terms. The term "rolling" here is a slang term for making cannabis, which is a drug. So the post is about a job that involves handling drugs. Therefore, it's T. 

But wait, the label rules include "slang for drugs". If "rolling" is slang for drug use, then it's T. However, "rolling" in the context of making cannabis products is a process, not necessarily using the drug. But the post is about a job that involves working with cannabis products, which are drugs. So the text is showing an activity related to drug use, hence T. 

Alternatively, if the job is in a legal cannabis business, then it's not T. But the label rules don't consider the legality. The rules are about whether the text shows drug use. The text is about a job in a cannabis-related business, which is part of the drug trade. Therefore, the answer is T.
