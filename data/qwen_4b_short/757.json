Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "busy singing Uptown Girl at rock choir under the influence of codeine!" 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The phrase "under the influence of codeine" is crucial. Codeine is an opioid, which is classified as an illicit drug. The person is explicitly stating they are under its influence. Additionally, "singing Uptown Girl at rock choir" might be a metaphor or just a description of an activity, but the key part is the mention of codeine. 

The label rules say T if it's about drug use. Since codeine is a drug and the person is under its influence, this should be labeled T. The other parts of the sentence don't seem to relate to drug use beyond that. So the answer is T.
