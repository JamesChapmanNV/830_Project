Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a mother forcing her 6-year-old son to overdose on meth, cocaine, and other drugs to collect a $100,000 insurance payout.

First, I need to check if this falls under the T category, which includes text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is whether the post is directly discussing the use of drugs. The mother is forcing her son to overdose on meth and cocaine, which are both illicit drugs. The act of using drugs, especially in this context of forcing a child to overdose, clearly shows drug use. The mention of other drugs also fits under the T category. 

Additionally, the post is about the mother's actions to obtain an insurance payout, but the main point is the drug use. Even though the insurance payout is a motive, the core of the post is the drug abuse. The rules state that T includes any text that shows drug use, whether it's using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Here, the mother is using drugs (forcing her son to overdose), so that's a clear T. 

The F category is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors. This post isn't any of those. It's a direct statement about drug use in a harmful context. So the label should be T.
