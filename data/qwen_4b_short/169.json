Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Now playing ðŸŽµSasha Lopez & BRUJA - Overdose 18.03.21 Listen here:"

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The song title here is "Overdose." Overdose is a term that can be related to drug use, but I need to be careful. In some contexts, "overdose" might be a metaphor or a song title. However, the term "overdose" is commonly associated with drug abuse. The song title could be referencing drug use, but the post itself doesn't explicitly mention using, selling, or any other drug-related activity. It's just a music post with a song title. The artist names don't seem to indicate drug-related activities either. The date is 18.03.21, which is probably the release date of the song. The label is T if it shows drug use, otherwise F. Since the post doesn't mention any drug use, just a song title, I think it's F. But wait, the song title is "Overdose," which could be a reference. However, the rules specify that the text must show drug use. The post itself doesn't state that the song is about drug use. It's just a music post. So the answer should be F.
