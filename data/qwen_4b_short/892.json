Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about protests in Iran regarding land confiscation by the judiciary. The key here is to check if the text mentions any illicit or abusive drug use, using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs.

Looking at the post: "Nov 2 - Near Arak, central #Iran Villagers continue to protest a recent ruling by the regime's judiciary allowing local officials to confiscate their lands. #IranProtests". There's no mention of drugs anywhere here. The topic is about land rights and protests, not related to drug use. The hashtags are about Iran and protests, not drugs. So according to the rules, since there's no drug-related content, the label should be F. I need to make sure I'm not missing any slang or hidden references. But the text is straightforward, so F is correct.
