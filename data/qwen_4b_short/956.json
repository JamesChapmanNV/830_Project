Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "Cumbria in Bloom gets social to encourage gardeners to share:".

First, I need to check if this post mentions anything related to illicit or abusive drug use. The label rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

Looking at the post, the main topic is "Cumbria in Bloom" which sounds like an event or initiative related to gardening. The phrase "gets social to encourage gardeners to share" suggests it's about social media engagement to promote gardening activities. There's no mention of drugs, drug-related activities, or any slang terms. The keywords here are gardening, sharing, social media, and encouraging. 

I don't see any indication of drug use or related terms. The activity is about gardening, which is completely unrelated to drug abuse. Even though "social" is part of the title, it's referring to social media as a platform, not drug use. 

So according to the rules, since there's no mention of drugs or drug-related activities, the label should be F. The post is about a gardening event, so it's a different topic altogether. No need to consider metaphors or other interpretations here. The answer is F.
