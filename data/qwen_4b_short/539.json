Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label each post as T or F based on the rules provided. The first post is about George's girlfriend talking about his overdose in March and the symptoms, like stomach hurting. Then in May 2020 arrest video, the same stomach complaint is mentioned. The second post mentions Floyd saying he ate too many drugs from a body cam.

For the first post: The mention of overdose and symptoms related to drug use (stomach hurting) is a direct reference to drug use. The fact that it's mentioned in an arrest video might imply that the person was using drugs, so this should be T. 

Second post: Floyd saying he ate too many drugs. "Ate too many drugs" is a direct reference to drug use, so that's T. 

Wait, but the rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. "Ate too many drugs" is a slang term, so that's definitely T. The first post's stomach hurting is a symptom of drug use, so that's also T. So both should be T. But wait, the user said to return only T or F for each post. The labels are for each numbered post. The user's example shows two posts, so maybe each is labeled separately. The answer should be T for both? Let me check again. The first post's content is about overdose and symptoms (stomach pain) which is related to drug use. The second is Floyd saying he ate too many drugs. Both are T. So the labels are T and T. But the user might have a different answer. Wait, maybe the first post is about a past event, but the symptoms are part of drug use. So T. The second is a direct statement about eating too many drugs, which is T. So both labels are T.
