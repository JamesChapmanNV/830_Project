Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "At that point most folks are already drawing a morphine prescription, heroin is not that wild." 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the mention of "morphine prescription" is a medical drug, right? Morphine is a controlled substance, but it's prescribed for pain. However, the next part says "heroin is not that wild." Heroin is an illicit drug, so that's a slang term. The phrase "not that wild" might be a slang way of saying heroin isn't as strong or as sought after as other drugs, but it's still referring to heroin, which is an illicit drug.

So the post is talking about heroin, which is an illicit drug. Even though morphine is a medical drug, the mention of heroin is a direct reference to an illicit drug. The user is discussing the context where heroin is used, possibly implying that people are already on morphine, so heroin isn't as big a deal. That seems like it's discussing drug use, specifically heroin, which is an illicit drug. Therefore, this would fall under T. 

Wait, but is the post just discussing the medical use of morphine and heroin as a slang term? The key is whether the text is showing illicit or abusive drug use. The mention of heroin is a direct reference to the drug, so even if it's in a context of comparison, it's still a drug use. So the label should be T.
