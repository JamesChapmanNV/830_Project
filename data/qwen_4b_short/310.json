Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about the crack epidemic and mentions a documentary. Then it compares fentanyl to crack and says "Fight me."

First, I need to check if the post contains any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The mention of "crack epidemic" and "fentanyl" are drugs, but the context here is discussing the historical context and the documentary. The user is talking about the government's role in allowing crack into the country, which is a policy or historical discussion. The phrase "Fight me" at the end is a bit of a hyperbolic statement, but it's not directly about using or seeking drugs. 

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't explicitly mention using or seeking drugs. It's more about discussing the impact of drugs on society and a documentary. The comparison of fentanyl to crack is a metaphorical or historical reference, not a direct statement about using the drug. 

So, the label should be F because it's a discussion about the history and policy related to drugs, not directly about using or seeking them. The "GASP" is an emotional reaction, but not related to drug use. The key here is whether the post is about the actual use or just discussing the issue. Since the user is talking about the documentary and the historical context, it's more of a F case.
