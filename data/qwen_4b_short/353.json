Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about 4/20, which is a day associated with cannabis culture. The user mentions being an advocate for cannabis, having a dinner with family, and says "The weed can wait..." 

First, I need to check if there's any explicit mention of drug use. The term "weed" is slang for cannabis, which is an illicit drug. The post mentions being an advocate for cannabis, which could be related to drug use. Also, the user is celebrating 4/20, which is a day for cannabis, so that's a strong indicator. The phrase "The weed can wait" might be a metaphor, but given the context of the day and the mention of cannabis, it's more likely referring to using weed. 

The rules say T if there's text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. Since "weed" is slang and the context is about cannabis culture, this would fall under T. The other parts of the post are about birthdays and family, but the key elements here are the references to cannabis. So the label should be T.
