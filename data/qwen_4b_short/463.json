Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about education, patient-centered care, and ending the War on Drugs. The key points here are discussing addiction, overdose, and the War on Drugs.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use directly. The user mentioned "preventing #addiction or overdose" which are related to drugs, but the post is more about policy and systemic issues rather than personal drug use. The mention of "supply safer" could be related to drug policy, not individual use. The hashtag #WarOnDrugs is a policy discussion, not about using drugs. 

The rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention any of these actions. It's more about advocating for policy changes and ending the War on Drugs, which is a F category. The user is discussing the harm of the War on Drugs, which is a medical or policy discussion. So the label should be F.
