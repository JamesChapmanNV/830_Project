Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Bankroll Bird - Codeine & Adderall â€¢ ðŸŽ¹: â€¢ ðŸŽ¥: TheFlyFamily #RIPPrince".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the title is "Bankroll Bird - Codeine & Adderall". Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medications, but it's also classified as an opioid, which is a controlled drug. Adderall is a stimulant medication, typically prescribed for ADHD, but it's also a controlled substance. The mention of these drugs in the title could indicate that the post is related to drug use. However, the context here is unclear. The hashtags include #RIPPrince, which might refer to the musician Prince, who passed away. The mention of "Bankroll Bird" could be a reference to a song or a project, but the drugs listed are specific.

But the key here is whether the text directly shows drug use. The title lists Codeine and Adderall, which are drugs. However, without more context, it's possible that this is just a reference to a song or a project name, not necessarily indicating current use. However, the presence of the drugs in the title might be considered as showing drug use. Alternatively, if it's a song title or a project name, it might be F. But the rules say if it's slang or mentions using, seeking, etc. So if the drugs are mentioned in the context of use, then T. But if it's just listing the drugs as part of a title, maybe not. 

Wait, the user is moderating for drug abuse. The label T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the post is about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The title here is "Bankroll Bird - Codeine & Adderall". If this is a song or a project that references drug use, then it might be T. However, if it's just a title that includes the names of drugs without indicating use, maybe F. But the problem is that the presence of the drugs in the title could be considered as showing drug use. For example, if someone is talking about using codeine and adderall, then T. But if it's just a title, maybe not. However, the rules don't specify that it has to be in a context of use. It's possible that the title is just listing the drugs, which could be considered as showing drug use. So the answer might be T. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the hashtag #RIPPrince is a red herring. The mention of Codeine and Adderall in the title is the key. Since those are drugs, even if it's just a title, it's showing the drugs, which would be T. Therefore, the label should be T.
