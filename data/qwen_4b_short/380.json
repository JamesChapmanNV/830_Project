Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about criticizing the incarceration of people for cannabis and advocating for abolishing prisons.

First, I need to check if the text mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The main topic here is about cannabis incarceration and prison abolition. The key words here are "cannabis" and "incarcerating people for cannabis." The user is talking about the evil of incarcerating for cannabis, which is a drug. But the post is more about the policy of incarceration rather than the act of using or seeking drugs. 

The label rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use. The post doesn't mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Instead, it's discussing the policy aspect of prisons and cannabis. The mention of cannabis is in the context of legal status (illegal) and incarceration, not personal use. The user is talking about the system, not the individual's drug use. 

So, the post is about policy and criticism of the prison system, not about drug use itself. Therefore, it should be labeled F, as it's not about drug use but a medical/policy discussion. The mention of cannabis is part of the policy discussion, not the act of using drugs. The user is not discussing the use of drugs but the legal and social implications of incarceration. So the correct label is F.
