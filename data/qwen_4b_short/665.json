Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "3:33 my loveðŸ’• if you were a drug I'd overdose off you my love". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention T if the text includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key part is "if you were a drug I'd overdose off you". The phrase "overdose off you" is a metaphor. The person is using "drug" in a metaphorical sense, not referring to actual drug use. The mention of overdose is hyperbolic, expressing deep affection rather than actual drug use.

So, the words "drug" and "overdose" here are part of a metaphor, not indicating actual drug use. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking drugs. The user is expressing emotional dependence, not actual drug abuse. 

Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled as F because it's a metaphorical expression, not a direct reference to drug use. The presence of "drug" is part of a metaphor, not slang or actual usage. The answer is F.
