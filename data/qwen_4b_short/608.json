Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "They do crack at orgies conducted by radical right wing corrupt RepubliCONS. Ask cowthorn about it. Now go back to school and get an education. President Biden WON. Everyone caught committing ELECTION FRAUD has been a REPUBLICON."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The term "crack" is a slang for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. The phrase "do crack" would mean using crack cocaine. The rest of the post talks about political stuff, election fraud, and mentions Republicans, but the key part here is "crack." 

So according to the rules, if the text shows drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang), then it's T. The word "crack" here is a slang term for the drug, so that's a clear T. The other parts are political statements, which fall under F. But since there's a T in there, the overall label should be T. The other parts don't relate to drug abuse. So the answer is T.
