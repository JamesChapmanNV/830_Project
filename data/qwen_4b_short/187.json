Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Mission Woman admits to trafficking over $1M in crystal meth and black tar heroin".

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "trafficking over $1M in crystal meth and black tar heroin". The term "trafficking" is explicitly mentioned, which is part of the drug abuse context. Crystal meth and black tar heroin are specific drugs, which are classified as illicit. The act of trafficking them is a form of drug abuse or illicit use. 

So, the post is reporting on someone admitting to trafficking large amounts of these drugs. That directly falls under the T category because it's about trafficking, which is part of the drug abuse. The mention of specific drugs also fits under the T label. There's no mention of medical use, policy discussion, or anything else that would fall under F. 

Therefore, the correct label should be T.
