Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label each part of the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The rules are that T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for everything else, like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: "We knew is We knew is #Capitalist Pete worked on the #NeverBernie Pac #Cannabis "Tree of Life" we can not eat Abortion is #Healthcare we never got $7.25 is Poverty Wage 2022 protect #Fascism by Jim Crow, Rule of Law"

First, I need to break down each part. The first part is "We knew is We knew is #Capitalist". That seems like a hashtag related to politics, maybe a meme or a political statement. Not sure if that's drug-related. Then "Pete worked on the #NeverBernie Pac" – again, political, possibly related to a campaign. 

Next is "#Cannabis "Tree of Life" we can not eat". Here, "Cannabis" is mentioned. But the context is a Tree of Life, and the phrase "we can not eat" might be a metaphor. However, the word "Cannabis" is a drug, but is it being used in the context of drug use? The user is asking if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The mention of Cannabis could be a slang term or a reference to the plant. But the part after that says "we can not eat", which might be a metaphor, like not being able to consume it, but not necessarily about drug use. 

Then "Abortion is #Healthcare we never got" – that's a political statement about healthcare, not related to drugs. "$7.25 is Poverty Wage 2022" is economic information. "protect #Fascism by Jim Crow, Rule of Law" – political terms again.

Now, the key part is the "#Cannabis" part. The user's rules include "slang for drugs". So if "Cannabis" is being used as a slang term, but in this case, the user is using it in a hashtag, possibly as a reference to a political or social movement. However, the mention of "Cannabis" in the post is part of a hashtag, and the following phrase "we can not eat" might be a metaphor, but the presence of "Cannabis" could be considered as a drug. However, the context here is not about using or seeking the drug. The user is not talking about using cannabis, but rather using it as a symbol or part of a political statement. 

But according to the rules, if the text shows any indication of drug use, it's T. So if the post mentions "Cannabis" as a slang term, but in this case, it's part of a hashtag, which might be a reference to a political movement or a meme. However, the user might be using "Cannabis" in a way that's not directly about drug use. Alternatively, the mention of "Cannabis" could be considered as a drug, but the rest of the post doesn't show any use, seeking, buying, etc. 

So the main question is whether "Cannabis" in the post is considered as showing drug use. Since the user is asking to label T if it's showing illicit or abusive drug use, and "Cannabis" is a drug, but the context here is not about using it. The post is more about political statements and hashtags. Therefore, the presence of "Cannabis" might not be considered as T, unless it's explicitly mentioned in the context of use. 

But the user's rules include "slang for drugs". If "Cannabis" is a slang term, but in this case, the user is using it in a hashtag, which is part of a political statement. So maybe it's F because it's not about use, but about a political movement. Alternatively, if the hashtag is a reference to the drug, then maybe it's T. 

But the user's instruction says to return only T or F. So I need to decide. The presence of the word "Cannabis" in the post is a drug, but the context is not about using it. Therefore, the label would be F. Unless the hashtag is a reference to drug use. But the rest of the post doesn't mention anything about using, selling, etc. So the answer is F.
