Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking to determine if the given social media post falls under T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). The post is: "So Candlestick were the owners? That is news to me! Get off the heroin pal!"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The phrase "Get off the heroin pal!" stands out. "Heroin" is a Schedule I controlled substance, so that's definitely a drug. The word "heroin" is a direct reference to illicit drug use. The rest of the sentence seems to be about Candlestick being owners, which is unrelated. The exclamation "Get off the heroin pal!" is a bit unclear, but "heroin" is the key term here. Since the post includes the explicit mention of heroin, which is an illicit drug, the label should be T. The other parts of the post don't involve drug use, but the presence of "heroin" is enough to trigger the T label.
