Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a drug overdose, specifically opioids affecting breathing and the risk of overdose.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post here is explaining the mechanism of opioids causing overdose. It mentions opioids affecting breathing and the consequences of taking too high a dose. The key here is whether the post is discussing drug use itself or just providing information about the drug's effects. 

The post doesn't mention any specific drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. It's more of an educational statement about the dangers of opioids, explaining how they work. It's informing about the medical effects rather than promoting or discussing the use of drugs. 

So, according to the rules, since it's a medical explanation about the risks of opioids, it's not directly talking about drug use. Therefore, the label should be F. But wait, I need to make sure. The post does mention opioids, which are drugs. But the content is about the effects of overdose, not the use or abuse. The user is probably not promoting drug use but explaining the risks. So F is correct here.
