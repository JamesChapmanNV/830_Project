Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Wiz Khalifa annoys the shit out of me with his "no blunt" policy but the bitch hops on the codeine train no problem."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the key parts are "no blunt" policy and "hops on the codeine train." "Blunt" here is slang for a cannabis joint, which is a drug. Then "codeine train" refers to codeine, which is an opioid, a controlled substance. The phrase "hops on the codeine train" is a metaphor, but the actual mention of codeine is a drug. However, the user's instruction says to check if the text shows drug use. The mention of codeine is a direct reference to the drug. But the user might be considering if it's a metaphor. However, the rules state that even if it's slang or a metaphor, if it's related to drugs, it's T. 

But wait, the rules specify "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So "codeine train" is a slang term. The user is using "codeine" as a direct reference. So the text is referring to using codeine. Therefore, the label should be T. 

But wait, the first part is about "no blunt" policy, which is about cannabis. So the post is talking about someone's policy on cannabis and then mentions codeine. The second part is about "hops on the codeine train no problem," which is a metaphor, but the actual drug is codeine. So the text shows drug use (codeine), so it's T. 

But maybe the user is considering that "hops on the codeine train" is a metaphor. However, the rules include slang for drugs. So even if it's a metaphor, if it's a slang term, then it's T. Therefore, the correct label is T.
