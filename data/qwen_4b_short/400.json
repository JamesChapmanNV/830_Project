Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "We see you have been smoking that laughing lettuce again. Madison Cawthorn said you are a heavy heroin user."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the first part says "smoking that laughing lettuce again." "Laughing lettuce" is a slang term for LSD, which is an illicit drug. So that's a clear indicator of drug use. Then it mentions "heavy heroin user." Heroin is definitely an illicit drug. 

The user might be referring to someone using drugs, so the post is directly stating that the person is a heavy heroin user. The mention of "smoking laughing lettuce" is also a direct reference to drug use. There's no context here that suggests this is metaphorical or related to something else. The mention of Madison Cawthorn, a real person, might be a reference to a public figure, but the content itself is about drug use.

So both parts of the post are directly referencing drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
