Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Also he ex boyfriend was a drug dealer. The man who shot at the cops was a legal gun owner. That is why he was never prosecuted."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the first part: "ex boyfriend was a drug dealer." "Drug dealer" directly refers to someone involved in trafficking or selling drugs. That's a clear T. 

The second part mentions "man who shot at the cops was a legal gun owner." This seems to be about gun ownership and not directly related to drug use. The phrase "never prosecuted" might be a reason for not being charged, but it's not about drug use itself. 

The third part "That is why he was never prosecuted" is a consequence of being a legal gun owner, not related to drugs. 

Since the first part explicitly mentions a drug dealer, which is trafficking/selling, that's a T. The rest of the post doesn't mention drug use, so even though there's a mention of a legal gun owner, it's not related to drugs. So the label should be T.
