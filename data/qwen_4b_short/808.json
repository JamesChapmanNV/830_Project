Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "I'm sippin that lean, hurtin my splean but I'm sippin it clean, sippin codeine...."

First, I need to understand what the labels mean. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the person mentions "sippin that lean" and "hurtin my splean". "Lean" is a slang term for methamphetamine, which is an illicit drug. "Sippin" here is likely "sipping", but in context, it's probably "sipping" the drug. "Hurtin my splean" is a metaphor for the spleen, which is a part of the body, but in this case, it's likely referring to the effects of the drug on the body. Then, "sippin it clean" might mean using the drug in a way that's clean, but the key part is "sippin codeine". Codeine is an opioid, which is an illicit drug when used without a prescription.

So, the post mentions using codeine, which is a drug. Even though the user might be using it in a way that's not explicitly illegal (like for medical purposes), the context here is likely recreational use. The mention of "lean" and "codeine" clearly points to drug use. Therefore, the label should be T.
