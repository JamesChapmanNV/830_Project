Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking me to determine if the given social media post falls under category T (text shows illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). 

First, I need to understand the content of the post. The person mentions taking ER morphine since 1993 and IR morphine now. They talk about not being switched to oxy for trauma, oral surgery, or loritab elixir for COPD, bronchitis, or flu cough. Also, they mention not getting Soma for muscle injuries or Ativan for flying or dentist visits.

Now, I need to check if this is about drug use. Morphine is a controlled substance, typically used for pain management. The user is discussing their long-term use of morphine, which is a prescription medication. However, the post is about their experience with medical treatments, specifically the lack of alternative medications they've been given. They're not talking about using drugs recreationally or in a slang context. They're discussing medical necessity and possible issues with their prescriptions.

The key here is whether the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The user is not using drugs in a way that's considered abuse or illicit. They're talking about their medical treatment, even though they're on long-term medication. The mention of not being switched to other medications might indicate a problem with their healthcare, but it's not about using drugs illegally or abusing them. 

Also, terms like "ER morphine" and "IR morphine" refer to specific types of morphine preparations, which are medical. The other medications mentioned (oxy, loritab, Soma, Ativan) are also prescription drugs. The user is not using these in a slang context or for non-medical purposes. 

Therefore, the post is about medical treatment and possible issues with prescription medications, not about drug abuse or illicit use. So the label should be F.
