Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "I was so down bad fo her till she used heroin then she died and i felt null".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "used heroin". Heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance, so that's definitely an illicit drug. The person mentions that the user "used heroin", which directly points to drug use. Additionally, the context is about someone's death after using heroin, which reinforces the drug use aspect. 

The other parts of the post talk about feeling down and feeling null, which are emotional responses, but the main action here is the use of heroin. The label rules specify that T is for any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since "used heroin" is a clear instance of drug use, this should be labeled T. 

I should make sure there's no other possible interpretation. The phrase "fo her" might be a typo for "for her", but that's not relevant here. The key is the mention of heroin use leading to death. So the answer is T.
