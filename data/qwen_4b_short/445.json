Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I have an orthopedic joke but it may crack you up". The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any drugs or drug-related terms. The post talks about an orthopedic joke and something that might "crack you up". The word "crack" here is likely a metaphor, meaning to make someone laugh. The term "orthopedic" refers to bones or musculoskeletal system, so the joke is probably about a medical topic. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any slang related to drugs. The word "crack" isn't used in the context of drugs (like crack cocaine) here. So the post is just a joke about a medical topic, not related to drug abuse. Therefore, the label should be F.
