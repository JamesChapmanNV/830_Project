Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Why you pouring all that codeine in that Sprite, Why ‚ùì"

First, I need to check if the post mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "codeine." Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug in many contexts. The phrase "pouring all that codeine in that Sprite" suggests someone is adding codeine to a drink, which is clearly using the drug. 

The rules state that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, the action is using codeine, which is a drug. Even though it's in a drink, the act of using it is what matters. The question is rhetorical, but the content still indicates drug use. 

I should make sure there's no other context that might make this F. The post is asking why someone would do that, but the presence of codeine in the text is enough to label it as T. There's no mention of medical use or policy discussion here. So the correct label is T.
