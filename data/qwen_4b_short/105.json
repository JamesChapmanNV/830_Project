Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post says, "Accidentally taken too much codeine at work and I actually feel off my face ðŸ˜‚". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to parse the content. The person mentions taking too much codeine. Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance, so that's a drug. The key here is whether this counts as illicit or abusive use. The person says they "accidentally" took too much. But even accidental overdose can be considered misuse, which falls under abusive use. The phrase "feel off my face" is a slang term for being high or intoxicated, which is a common way to describe the effects of drugs. 

But wait, codeine is a prescription medication. So is it considered illicit? Well, in the context of the label rules, it's about whether the text shows drug use. The user is talking about taking codeine, which is a drug, and the consequences. The accidental overdose is a form of misuse, which would fall under T. The slang "off my face" is a common expression for being high, which is a drug-related term. So this would be a T. 

But wait, is codeine considered an illicit drug? It's a controlled substance, but it's also a medication. However, the label rules include any drug use, whether it's prescription or illicit. The key is that the text shows drug use. So even if it's a prescription drug, if it's being used in a way that's considered abuse (like taking too much), it's T. 

So the answer should be T.
