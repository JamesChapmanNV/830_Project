Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, like medical/policy discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post: "I fully agree. It was my target months ago. Sadly Pfizer bought out the Feds. Like any good dealer you gotta push the stash at hand."

First, break down the sentences. The first part is "I fully agree. It was my target months ago." Not sure what "target" refers to here. Maybe a target for something, but not obviously drug-related. Then "Sadly Pfizer bought out the Feds." Pfizer is a pharmaceutical company. Buying out the Feds? That sounds like a metaphor or a political statement, maybe referring to a takeover or some kind of corporate action. Then the last sentence: "Like any good dealer you gotta push the stash at hand." The word "dealer" here is key. In drug context, a dealer is someone who sells drugs. "Push the stash" refers to distributing or selling drugs. "Stash" is slang for drugs. So that part clearly indicates drug dealing. 

But wait, the first part about Pfizer and the Feds. Is there a real-world reference here? Maybe a reference to a real event where Pfizer acquired a company related to the FDA or something? But the user is asking about the content of the post, not real-world accuracy. The post uses "dealer" and "stash," which are direct drug slang. Even if the first part is metaphorical, the last part is clearly about drug dealing. So the label should be T because it mentions drug-related activities. The mention of Pfizer and the Feds might be a metaphor, but the key part is "dealer" and "stash," which are T indicators. So the answer is T.
