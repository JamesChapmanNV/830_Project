Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "If alcohol can be legal then so should cannabis. Alcohol if far more harmful to the body and minds. Cannabis can add so much more to the economy and help so many people."

First, I need to check if this post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The rules say T if it's about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, like medical discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the main points are comparing alcohol and cannabis legalization. The user is arguing that since alcohol is legal and more harmful, cannabis should be legal too. They mention cannabis's benefits for the economy and people. There's no direct mention of using, selling, buying, or trafficking drugs. The terms used are "cannabis" which is a drug, but the post is discussing legalization and benefits, not actual use or related activities. 

The key here is whether the post is about the use of drugs. Since the user is talking about legalizing cannabis, not using it, and the context is about policy and economy, it's more of a policy discussion. So according to the rules, F would be the correct label because it's not about drug use but rather a discussion on legalization and benefits. There's no slang or direct reference to using drugs, just talking about legal status and economic impact.
