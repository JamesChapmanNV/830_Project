Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "And I'm sippin on that codeine not Brandy ðŸ˜›". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to parse the sentence. The person is saying they're "sippin on that codeine not Brandy". "Sippin" is slang for drinking, so "sipping on codeine" would mean consuming codeine. Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered illicit or abusive drug use. The mention of "not Brandy" might be a typo or a play on words, but the key part here is "codeine". 

Now, checking the label rules. Since codeine is a drug, and the person is using it, that's a T. The emoji is just an expression, but the main content is about consuming codeine. So the label should be T.
