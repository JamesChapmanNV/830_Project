Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the post "Please tell your drug dealer I said hie" as either T or F based on the given rules. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

First, I need to analyze the post. The key words here are "drug dealer" and "hie". "Drug dealer" directly relates to selling drugs, which is part of the T category. The phrase "I said hie" is a bit confusing. "Hie" is a slang term, but I'm not sure. Wait, "hie" can be a slang for "hi" or maybe a term related to drugs? Let me think. In some contexts, "hie" might be used as a greeting, but in drug slang, I'm not certain. However, the presence of "drug dealer" is enough to trigger the T label. The act of telling someone (the dealer) something could be part of using or seeking drugs. Even if "hie" is just a greeting, the mention of a drug dealer is enough. So the label should be T.
