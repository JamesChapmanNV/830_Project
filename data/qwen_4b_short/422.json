Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Don't matter, the coroner already said he died from a drug OVERDOSE. The police was NOT a contributing factor. Floyd was dead with or without police being there!" 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "drug OVERDOSE." The word "overdose" is directly related to drug use, specifically an excessive amount of a drug leading to poisoning. The mention of "drug overdose" clearly indicates that the person died from drug use. The rest of the post talks about the police not being a factor, but that's more about the circumstances of the death rather than the drug use itself.

The label rules state that T is for text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post uses "drug overdose," which is a direct reference to drug use. Even though the post is discussing a specific case (Floyd), the key term here is "drug overdose," which falls under T. The other parts of the post are about the police not being a factor, which is F, but the presence of "drug overdose" is enough to label it as T. 

So the answer should be T.
