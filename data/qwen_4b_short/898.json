Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about promoting Arak Wardy and Domaine Wardy wines, mentioning family, and using hashtags like #drinkresponsibly.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The words used here are "Arak Wardy" and "Domaine Wardy," which are wine brands. Arak is a type of distilled spirit, but it's also a term sometimes used in slang for drugs, like in the context of "Arak" being a slang term for a drug. Wait, but in this case, the post is about wine, so maybe it's a brand name. However, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so I need to be careful.

The hashtags include #drinkresponsibly, which is a common tag for promoting responsible drinking. The post also mentions family and wine, so it's about promoting the wines. There's no explicit mention of drug use, selling, buying, or slang terms for drugs. The term "Arak" could be a point of confusion because in some contexts, it's a slang term for a drug, but here it's part of a wine brand. The post is about wine, not drugs. The hashtags are about responsible drinking, which is F. So the label should be F. The answer is F.
