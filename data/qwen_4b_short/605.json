Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "baby i can't quit that lean put a ring around codeine üíç". The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to break down the sentence. The user mentions "lean" and "codeine". I know that "lean" is a slang term for cocaine. So that's definitely a drug reference. Then "codeine" is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. The phrase "put a ring around codeine" is a bit cryptic, but "ring around" might be a metaphor or a slang term. However, given that codeine is a drug, even if the phrase is metaphorical, the mention of codeine itself is a direct reference to a drug. 

Also, the use of "can't quit that lean" suggests ongoing use or struggle with addiction. The mention of codeine is explicit. So both "lean" and "codeine" are drugs. Therefore, this post is showing drug use, so the label should be T. I need to make sure there's no other context that might make it F, like medical discussion or metaphor. But "codeine" is a drug, and "lean" is slang for cocaine. The phrase "put a ring around" might be a metaphor, but the presence of the drug names makes it T.
