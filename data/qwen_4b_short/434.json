Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is titled "Legal Recreational Cannabis Reduces Prescription Drug Demand: Study [Written By Brett Wilkins]". 

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The label T is for any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post here is about a study that says legal recreational cannabis reduces prescription drug demand. 

So, the key words here are "legal recreational cannabis" and "reduces prescription drug demand". The study is discussing the effect of legalizing cannabis on prescription drug usage. There's no mention of actual drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. The focus is on the effect of legal cannabis on prescription drugs, not on the use of cannabis itself. 

The study is likely discussing the correlation between legal cannabis and reduced demand for prescription drugs. Since the post is about a study's findings, not about the use or distribution of drugs, it doesn't fit the T category. The label F would be appropriate here because it's a medical or policy discussion, which is covered under F. 

I should make sure there's no slang or hidden references. The term "recreational cannabis" is a standard term for legal marijuana, not slang. The post is about a study's results, so it's not about using or seeking drugs. Therefore, the correct label is F.
