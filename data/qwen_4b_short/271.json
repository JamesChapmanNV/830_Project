Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is about a lawsuit against Cephalon's Actiq, which is a drug. The label rules are T if it's about drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang), otherwise F.

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The title says "Suit Claims Cephalon's Actiq Is Fatal to Teeth | BNET Pharma Blog | BNET:". So, it's a news article or blog post discussing a legal case where someone is claiming that Actiq (a drug) is harmful to teeth. 

Now, Actiq is a prescription drug used for managing chemotherapy-induced nausea. The post is about a lawsuit, not about someone using the drug, seeking it, buying it, selling it, trafficking it, or using slang for drugs. The focus here is on the medical side, specifically a legal claim regarding the drug's side effects on teeth. 

The label rules say T is for drug use-related content. Since this is a news article discussing a legal case about the drug's effects, not about the use or abuse of drugs, it should be labeled F. The post isn't about using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. It's more about a medical or legal issue related to the drug's side effects. Therefore, the correct label is F.
