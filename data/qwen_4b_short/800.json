Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Says it all with only 4 RT'S Shame for him and his family". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The key words here are "RT'S". Wait, RT could stand for "retweets" in social media, but sometimes it's used as an abbreviation for "Ritalin" or other drugs. However, in the context of social media, RT is more commonly "retweet". But the user is moderating for drug abuse, so I need to check if "RT" here is slang for a drug.

Alternatively, maybe "RT" is part of a phrase. The phrase is "only 4 RT'S". If "RT" is slang for a drug, then this might be T. But I'm not sure. Let me think. In some contexts, "RT" can be an abbreviation for "Ritalin", which is a medication for ADHD, but not an illicit drug. However, in slang, sometimes "RT" could be used as a term for something else. But I'm not certain. 

The rest of the post is "Shame for him and his family". That's a bit vague. It could be about someone's actions, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The main thing is whether "RT" here is related to drug use. If "RT" is not a drug slang, then maybe it's F. But if it is, then T. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to "RT" as in "retweet", which is a social media term, so that would be F. The post is about someone's actions, but not directly mentioning drugs. The "shame" part could be a metaphor, but the rules say F if it's metaphor. However, if "RT" is a drug slang, then T. 

But I'm not sure if "RT" is a drug slang here. Maybe the user is using "RT" as a typo or abbreviation. Alternatively, maybe "RT" is part of a phrase like "RTs" as in "Ritalin", but that's a medication. 

Given the ambiguity, but since the post doesn't clearly mention any drug use, seeking, buying, etc., and "RT" is more likely a social media term, the label would be F. Unless "RT" is a slang term for a drug, which I'm not aware of. So I think the answer is F.
