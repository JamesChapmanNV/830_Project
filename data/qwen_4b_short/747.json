Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "If you gon fw a drug dealer at least fw a nigga who sell coke not a nigga who sell weed to his bros".

First, I need to understand what the post is saying. The user is talking about a drug dealer, specifically mentioning someone who sells cocaine (coke) versus someone who sells weed (marijuana) to his friends. The phrase "fw" is likely a typo for "for" or "from". The main point seems to be about choosing a drug dealer who sells coke over one who sells weed.

Now, applying the label rules. The T category is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The F category is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, it mentions "drug dealer", "sell coke", "sell weed". These are all direct references to drugs. The mention of selling drugs, specifically cocaine and marijuana, falls under the T category because it's about drug dealing, which is illicit. Even though it's comparing two types of drugs, the act of selling them is still considered drug use or trafficking. The post isn't discussing medical use, policy, or discouraging use. It's more about choosing between two types of drug dealers. Therefore, the label should be T.
