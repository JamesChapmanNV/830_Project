Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "Wait - we're told it was no way no how and overdose, weren't we?" The rules are T if it shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs), otherwise F.

First, I need to parse the sentence. The key words here are "no way no how" and "overdose". "No way no how" is a phrase that's often used to express that something is impossible or not possible. But in this context, it's part of a statement about an overdose. The user is questioning whether the overdose was indeed the case. 

Now, the main point here is whether the post is indicating drug use. The word "overdose" is directly related to drug abuse. However, the phrase "no way no how" is more of an expression of disbelief or confusion. The sentence seems to be discussing an overdose, which is a result of drug use. But does the post itself show the act of using drugs, or is it just talking about an overdose as a consequence?

The label T is for when the text shows the use of drugs. The post mentions an overdose, which is a result of drug use, but does it explicitly state that someone is using drugs? The sentence is more about questioning the circumstances of an overdose, not necessarily about the act of using drugs. However, the mention of overdose could be considered as part of the drug abuse context. But according to the rules, T is for showing the use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post doesn't explicitly mention any of these actions. It's more about the outcome (overdose) rather than the act of using drugs. 

Alternatively, maybe "overdose" is considered a slang term for drug use. But in this case, the post is talking about an overdose that happened, not the act of overdosing. The user is questioning whether the overdose was the case. So the post is discussing an overdose, which is a consequence of drug use, but the text itself doesn't directly show the use of drugs. Therefore, it might be labeled as F because it's not showing the act of using drugs, but rather the result. However, if the overdose is considered as part of the drug abuse context, maybe it's T. But according to the label rules, T is for showing the use, not the consequence. So the answer might be F. But I need to be careful here. The key is whether the text shows the act of using drugs. The post doesn't mention using drugs, but rather an overdose. So F.
