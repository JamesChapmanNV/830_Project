Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about a public service announcement (PSA) from CCTV's public channel on April 11, 2021, titled "PSA-Mass DPH Steps to Stop an Overdose." 

First, I need to recall the labeling rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the main content is a PSA about steps to stop an overdose. The title mentions "Mass DPH Steps to Stop an Overdose." DPH might stand for Drug Prevention Programs or something similar. The PSA is likely educational, providing information on how to prevent overdoses, which is a public health topic. 

There's no mention of actual drug use, slang, or specific drug names. The focus is on preventing overdoses, which is a medical or policy-related topic. The post is about a public service announcement, so it's probably aimed at informing the public about overdose prevention measures, not discussing drug use itself. 

Since the post doesn't include any text related to drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang, it falls under F. The content is about preventing overdoses, which is a public health issue, so it's categorized under F.
