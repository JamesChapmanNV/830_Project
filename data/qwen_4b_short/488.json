Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "ER doctor ruled out drug overdose in Floyd death". 

First, I need to understand the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key phrase is "ruled out drug overdose". The doctor is stating that there's no evidence of a drug overdose in the death of Floyd. This is a medical or news-related statement. The post isn't mentioning any drug use, seeking, buying, selling, or slang. It's just reporting on a medical determination. So, according to the rules, this would fall under F because it's a news or medical discussion, not indicating drug use. 

I need to make sure there's no hidden slang or indirect reference. The term "drug overdose" is a medical term, not slang. The post is about ruling out an overdose, not confirming it. Therefore, it's not T. The label should be F.
