Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "What is the story with that meme? Bloke looks like me - should use it as my account pic." 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The user is talking about a meme where a bloke looks like them and considering using it as an account picture. There's no mention of drugs or related terms here. The words "meme," "account pic," and "looks like me" are all unrelated to drug abuse. The label rules say T is for any text showing illicit or abusive drug use, and F for other cases. Since there's nothing related to drugs in the post, the correct label should be F. I don't see any slang or references to drugs here. Just a discussion about a meme and a profile picture. So the answer is F.
