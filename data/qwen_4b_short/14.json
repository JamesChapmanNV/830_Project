Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post related to drug abuse. The post is: "I seen her in my dream, fell in love with codeine." The options are T for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, and F for other cases.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use. The key here is the word "codeine." Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug. The phrase "fell in love with codeine" could imply that the person is using codeine, either for its effects or as a substitute for something else. 

But wait, codeine is also used in some over-the-counter medications, like cough syrups. However, in the context of social media posts related to drug abuse, the focus is on illicit use. The phrase "fell in love with codeine" might be a metaphor, but given the context of moderation for drug abuse, it's more likely that the user is referring to actual use. 

Also, the mention of "seen her in my dream" is a metaphorical or romantic statement, but the key part here is "codeine." Since codeine is a drug that's associated with abuse and addiction, especially when used without medical supervision, this would fall under T. 

I should make sure there's no other context that might make this a metaphor. But in the absence of other context, the direct mention of codeine as a drug use is a strong indicator. Therefore, the label should be T.
