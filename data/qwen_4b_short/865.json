Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about someone buying drugs from a dealer for 8 months, spending $20 a few times a week. The dealer doesn't give deals if you pay $100, only 10g. The person was told they need to spend more than $20, but they only had $20, so the dealer sold them some but was rude and they won't go back.

First, I need to check if this falls under T, which is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "buying from the same dealer," "spending 20$ a good couple times a week," "tells me I gotta spend more than 20," "sells me but was so rude." 

The main action here is buying drugs repeatedly, which is directly related to drug use. The mention of spending money on drugs, the dealer's interaction, and the frequency of purchases all point to T. Even though there's a mention of the dealer being rude, that's more of a behavioral aspect but doesn't change the fact that the core activity is drug buying. The rules include using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Here, buying is explicitly mentioned. So the label should be T.
