Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is in Korean and English, with hashtags related to EXO, a K-pop group. The main content mentions "overdose!!" but then talks about focusing on NCT and EXO, and celebrating 9 years with EXO. The hashtags include #9ToEternityWithEXO and #9YearswithEXO.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The word "overdose" could be a red flag, but I need to consider the context. The rest of the post is about a fan group, celebrating their time with the K-pop group EXO. The mention of "overdose" might be a typo or a misunderstanding. However, in some contexts, "overdose" can refer to something else, like a large amount of something, not necessarily drugs. But since the user is moderating for drug abuse, I need to be cautious.

The hashtags are all related to the group EXO, which is a K-pop idol group. The mention of "overdose" could be a mistake, maybe a typo for "overdo" or something else. However, the presence of "overdose" might be considered as a possible drug-related term. But the rest of the post is about celebrating their time with the group, so it's more likely a fan's message rather than drug use.

The rules state that T is for text showing drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post doesn't mention any of these activities. The "overdose" might be a mistake or a metaphor, but since it's a fan post, it's more likely a typo or a misunderstanding. Therefore, the correct label would be F because the post is about a fan group celebration, not drug-related content.
