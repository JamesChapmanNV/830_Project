Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "I ain't feelin none of you niggas I'm on morphine ðŸ’…". 

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The word "morphine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. So that's a direct mention of a drug. 

Now, the rest of the sentence: "I ain't feelin none of you niggas". The phrase "ain't feelin none" is a bit unclear, but "niggas" is a slang term, which might be offensive. However, the main point here is the mention of morphine. 

The user is on morphine, which is a drug. So even if the rest of the sentence is about feeling nothing, the key part is the drug reference. The emoji ðŸ’… might be related to morphine, but the label is based on the text content. 

So, since "morphine" is a drug and the person is on it, this should be labeled T. The other parts might be unrelated or even offensive, but the presence of the drug name makes it T. 

I need to make sure there's no other possible interpretation. The post is about feeling nothing because of morphine, which is a drug. So yes, T is correct.
