Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Bruh if he was dyin of an overdose what was the cop even gonna do lmao".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "overdose" and "cop". The user is asking about a scenario where someone is dying from an overdose and what the cop would do. 

The rules state that T is for text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post mentions "overdose", which is related to drug use. However, the question is hypothetical and not directly stating that someone is using drugs. It's more of a rhetorical question about a possible scenario. 

But wait, the term "overdose" itself is a slang term related to drug use. Even if it's hypothetical, the mention of overdose could still fall under T. However, the post is not explicitly stating that someone is using drugs, but rather posing a question about a situation where someone is dying from an overdose. 

The label rules say that if the text shows drug use, it's T. The question is about a scenario that could involve drug use, but is it showing the use? The post is not directly about someone using drugs, but rather about the response to an overdose. However, the mention of overdose is a direct reference to drug use. 

Alternatively, maybe the post is using "overdose" as a metaphor or in a different context. But in this case, it's likely referring to a drug overdose. The question is about what the cop would do, which is a medical or emergency situation. But the presence of "overdose" is a drug-related term. 

So according to the rules, since the text includes a reference to drug use (overdose), even if it's hypothetical, it should be labeled T. However, the user might be considering if it's a metaphor. But the term "overdose" is a direct slang for drug use. Therefore, the answer should be T.
