Okay, let's tackle this label. The user is asking me to determine if the social media post falls under T (illicit drug use) or F (other cases). The post mentions "#NCB found someone's #son but why would is surprised as #wife is a full high all time and #dealer big fish ðŸŽ£ and #NCB staff ðŸ¤³ with celebrity".

First, I need to break down the key terms. The hashtags include "full high all time" which directly refers to being under the influence of drugs. "High" is a common slang term for the effects of drugs, especially in the context of being high on something like marijuana or other illicit drugs. The mention of a "dealer" also points to drug trafficking or selling, which is part of the T category. 

The #NCB could refer to a social media handle or an organization, but the context here is the content of the post. The phrase "full high all time" is a clear indicator of drug use. Even though there's a mention of a "dealer" and "NCB staff," the main focus is on the wife being high, which is a direct reference to drug use. 

I should check if there's any metaphorical use here. However, "full high all time" is more likely a direct reference to being under the influence rather than a metaphor. The use of "high" in this context is pretty standard for drug use. The presence of "dealer" further supports the T label as it relates to drug dealing. 

There's no mention of medical use or policy discussion here. The post seems to be about someone being found using drugs, which is a clear T case. The other elements like "NCB staff" and "celebrity" might be part of the context but don't change the fact that the main content is about drug use. 

So, the answer should be T because the post explicitly mentions drug use (being high) and drug dealing.
