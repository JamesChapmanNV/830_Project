Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "I am in the middle of humming about to crack when my substantival-less duplicator brings me hoplites (not asked for) with aroid as I kill So how's your day going?"

First, I need to understand the key terms here. The rules specify that T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main challenge is to identify if any drug-related terms are present. The words "crack" might be a clue. "Crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. However, the sentence structure is a bit confusing. The user says "humming about to crack" â€“ "crack" here could be a metaphor, but in some contexts, it's slang for crack cocaine. However, the rest of the sentence seems to be using a lot of made-up or obscure words like "substantival-less duplicator," "hoplites," "aroid," and "kill." These words don't seem to be standard drug terms. 

But wait, "aroid" might be a misspelling or a slang term. Let me think. "Aroid" is a type of plant, but in some contexts, it might be used as slang. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, "hoplites" are ancient Greek soldiers, so that's a metaphor. "Duplicator" could be a term related to something else, maybe a device or a process. 

The phrase "crack" is the only possible drug reference here. If "crack" is used as a slang term for crack cocaine, then the post would be labeled T. However, the context is a bit unclear. The user is talking about "humming about to crack," which could be a metaphor for stress or something else. But in some slang, "crack" can refer to the drug. 

But the rest of the sentence is filled with non-standard terms. The user is also asking "So how's your day going?" which is a normal question. The key is whether the post is showing drug use. If "crack" is used in the sense of the drug, then it's T. If it's a metaphor, then F. 

However, given that the user is in a situation where they might be using "crack" as a slang term for the drug, even if the rest of the sentence is nonsensical, the presence of "crack" would trigger the T label. But I need to be careful here. The term "crack" is a common slang for crack cocaine, so if that's the case, then the post would be T. 

Alternatively, maybe "crack" is part of a metaphor or a made-up term. But given the rules, any mention of drug slang would be T. So I think the answer here is T because of "crack" being a slang term for crack cocaine. However, the rest of the sentence is unclear. But the presence of "crack" is enough to label it as T.
