Okay, let's see. The user is asking if I can help their dealer with a problem. The dealer has been waiting over a month for a front passenger occupant sensor for their Aviator. The user says it's getting old not being able to use the front passenger seat.

First, I need to check if this post relates to drug use. The label rules say T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. F is for other cases like medical/policy, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post mentions a "dealer," which could be a bit ambiguous. In some contexts, "dealer" might refer to someone selling drugs, but here it's in the context of a car part. The dealer is waiting for a part for their car, which is a vehicle part. The user is asking for help with that. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any slang related to drugs. The term "dealer" here is likely referring to a car dealer or someone selling cars, not drugs. The situation is about a car part delay, which is a mechanical or automotive issue. 

So, the post is about a car part problem, not drug-related. Therefore, the correct label would be F, as it's not related to drug use. The mention of "dealer" is in the context of a vehicle part, not drugs. There's no indication of any drug use or related activities here. The user is seeking help with a car part, which is a non-drug related matter.
