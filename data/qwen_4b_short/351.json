Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a case where someone died of an overdose, and the discussion is about the presence of fentanyl in the tablet and blood levels.

First, I need to check if the post mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. The post talks about fentanyl, which is an illicit drug. The user mentions "fentenyl" (probably a typo for fentanyl), the toxicology report, and overdose. The key points here are the presence of fentanyl in the body and the discussion around overdose. 

The rules say T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post is discussing a case where the person died from an overdose, which is directly related to drug use. Even though the post is explaining a medical case, the content is about drug use (fentanyl) and the consequences. The mention of blood levels and the toxicology report is part of the discussion around drug use. 

So, even though the post is about a case, the content is about drug use and overdose, which falls under T. The other cases (F) would be things like medical discussions that aren't about drug use, but here it's specifically about fentanyl and overdose. Therefore, the label should be T.
