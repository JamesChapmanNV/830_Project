Okay, let's see. The user provided a social media post and wants me to label it as T or F based on the rules given. The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise.

Looking at the post: The user mentions "heroin" in the sentence "people loved the heroin more". Heroin is a controlled substance, an illicit drug. So that's a clear mention of a drug. The rest of the post talks about HAHK, MPK, footfalls, Salman Khan's contribution, etc. But the key part here is "heroin". 

The label rules say that any mention of drug use, slang, or related terms should be T. Since heroin is a drug, even if it's in a metaphorical or discussion context, the presence of the drug name itself would trigger the T label. The other parts of the post don't mention drugs, so the main point here is the mention of heroin. 

Therefore, the correct label should be T.
