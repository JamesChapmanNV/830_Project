Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Can you do a list of the WRs Lamar gonna be throwin to wit that "wall"".

First, I need to understand what the post is about. The mention of "WRs" could stand for Wide Receivers in sports, probably football, since Lamar is a known football player. "Throwin to wit that 'wall'" might be a reference to a play or strategy in football, maybe something related to a defensive wall. The phrase "throwin to wit that 'wall'" is a bit unclear, but it seems like it's talking about a specific play or tactic in a game.

Now, checking the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

The post doesn't mention any drugs. It's about football terminology, specifically Wide Receivers and a play strategy. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or related slang. The words "throwin" might be slang, but in this context, it's part of a football play description. The term "wall" here is likely a sports term, not related to drugs. 

So, since there's no mention of drugs or drug-related terms, the label should be F. The user is asking for a list of players (WRs) that Lamar will throw to during a game, which is a sports-related question. Therefore, it's not T but F.
