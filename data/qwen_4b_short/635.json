Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Should crack down on the open drinking. That's just fuel for violence."

First, I need to check if this post relates to drug use. The label T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

The post mentions "open drinking." Wait, "open drinking" isn't a slang term for drugs. It's more about alcohol consumption in public places. The user is suggesting cracking down on that because it's fuel for violence. The mention of violence might be a metaphor, but the main subject here is about alcohol and public drinking. There's no mention of drugs, drug use, or any slang related to drugs. The phrase "fuel for violence" could be a metaphor, but the core issue here is about alcohol policy. Therefore, this doesn't fit the T category. It's more of a policy discussion or a social issue, so the label should be F.
