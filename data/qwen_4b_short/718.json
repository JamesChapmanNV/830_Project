Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post mentions a drug overdose and uses hashtags related to George Floyd. The key here is to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use.

First, the post says "He died of a drug overdose." That's a direct mention of drug use leading to death. The hashtag #GeorgeFloydDiedOfAnOverdose reinforces that. The other parts talk about riots and looting, which are separate issues. The rules state that T includes any mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Here, "drug overdose" is a direct reference to drug use. Even though the context is about a protest and manipulation, the explicit mention of drug overdose qualifies it as T. The other hashtags are about the trial and Black Lives Matter, but the key part is the overdose. So the label should be T.
