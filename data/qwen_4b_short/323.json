Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post says, "If you substitute crystal meth for green eggs and ham, suddenly Dr. Seuss' classic is about a drug dealer hooking a new customer."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to see if the post directly mentions drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

The post mentions "crystal meth," which is a specific illicit drug. Then it talks about substituting it for "green eggs and ham," which is a reference to Dr. Seuss's book. The second part says the book becomes about a drug dealer hooking a new customer. 

So, "crystal meth" is definitely a drug, and the context here is substituting it into a book, which implies that the original book's theme is being changed to involve a drug dealer. The mention of a drug dealer hooking a customer suggests selling or trafficking. 

But wait, the rules specify that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post is using "crystal meth" (a slang term for a drug) and mentions a drug dealer, which is related to selling. So this seems like a T case. 

However, I need to make sure there's no metaphorical use. The post is talking about substituting a drug into a book, but the main point is that the book is now about a drug dealer. The key elements here are the drug (crystal meth) and the act of selling (hooking a customer). 

Therefore, the label should be T because it's directly referencing drug use and trafficking.
