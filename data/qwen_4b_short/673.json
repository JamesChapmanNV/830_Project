Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Floyd was a junky. He was suffering from an overdose in the same way he had previously done. Justice will prevail."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "junky" and "overdose." "Junky" is a slang term for someone who uses drugs, so that's a clear indicator of drug use. The mention of an overdose also directly relates to drug abuse. The second part about justice prevailing is probably a statement about the legal system, but the first two sentences clearly discuss drug use.

The rules state that T is for any text that shows using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Since "junky" is slang and "overdose" is a direct reference to drug use, this should be labeled T. The rest of the post is about justice, which is F, but since the first part is T, the entire post is T. Wait, but the rules say to label based on whether the text shows drug use. If any part of the text is about drug use, then it's T. So even if the rest is about justice, the presence of "junky" and "overdose" makes it T. So the answer should be T.
