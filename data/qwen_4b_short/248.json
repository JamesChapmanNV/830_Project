Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "NFTs and cannabis are 2 disruptive industries... It's time to bring them together..."

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

So the post mentions "cannabis." Now, cannabis can be a drug, but the context here is about combining NFTs (non-fungible tokens) with cannabis as two disruptive industries. The key is whether the mention of cannabis is in the context of drug use or something else. 

The phrase "disruptive industries" suggests that the post is talking about the business or economic aspects of cannabis, maybe in a regulatory or market context. However, cannabis is a controlled substance in many places, so it's important to check if the post is referring to it in a way that's related to drug use. 

But the post doesn't mention any specific activities like using, selling, or seeking drugs. It's more about combining two industries. The mention of cannabis here is likely in the context of the industry, not the drug itself. Also, the use of "cannabis" without any context of use or abuse would fall under F unless there's a clear indication of drug-related activity. 

Another thing to consider is if "cannabis" is being used as slang for something else, but in this case, it's straightforward. The post is about bringing together two industries, so the label should be F unless there's a clear indication of drug use. Therefore, the answer is F.
