Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is about a movie where the main character is "trying too hard to be the good guy" and the cops they worked with are corrupt. The user mentions two types of corruption: beating people at traffic stops with racism and being a drug dealer.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for words like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about the cops being corrupt, but the examples given are about racism and being a drug dealer. 

Wait, the user says "I'm a drug dealer now lol" is one of the corrupt examples. So the post is discussing corruption in the police department, but the second example mentions someone being a drug dealer. However, the main point is that the post is talking about the corruption of the cops, not the drug use itself. 

The label rules say T is when the text shows drug use (using, seeking, buying, etc.) or slang. The post doesn't explicitly mention using drugs, but it does mention someone being a drug dealer. However, the context is about the corruption of the police, not the act of using drugs. The phrase "I'm a drug dealer now lol" is part of the example of corruption, but the post itself is not stating that the person is using drugs. It's more about the corruption of the police. 

So the post is discussing corruption, not the actual drug use. Therefore, the correct label would be F, as it's not about drug use but rather about police corruption. The mention of a drug dealer is part of the example of corruption, not the text itself showing drug use. Hence, the answer should be F.
