Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "i just found by chance and i'm so glad she's so beautiful i love girls". The rules are: T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs). F otherwise, like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs. The post talks about finding someone by chance, loving girls. The words used are "found", "glad", "beautiful", "love". There's no mention of drugs, drug use, slang, or any related terms. The phrase "found by chance" might be a metaphor, but it's not related to drugs. The person is expressing affection towards someone, not discussing drug-related activities. So according to the rules, this doesn't fit T. Therefore, the label should be F.
