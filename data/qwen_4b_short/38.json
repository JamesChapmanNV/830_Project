Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is from NormaJean, who says she's strong and uses pain meds, specifically morphine, and mentions she's on enough to kill an animal. She also says not to feel sorry for her.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use. The post mentions "pain meds" and "morphine," which is a controlled substance. The phrase "I'm on enough morphine to kill an animal" directly refers to the amount of morphine she's using. Also, the use of the slang "kill an animal" might be a metaphor, but in this context, it's likely referring to the potency of the drug. 

The rules state that T includes text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. The mention of morphine, which is a controlled drug, and the amount she's on (enough to kill an animal) indicates she's using it abusively. Additionally, she's asking not to feel sorry, which might be a sign of addiction or dependence. 

The other part of the post is about being strong and not wanting sympathy, which could be a common refrain from someone in recovery or dealing with addiction. However, the key here is the explicit mention of morphine and the quantity. Since morphine is a drug, and she's using it in a way that's potentially abusive (using enough to kill an animal), this would fall under T. 

I should also check if there's any other possible interpretation. The "kill an animal" might be a metaphor, but in the context of drug use, it's more likely a direct statement about the amount. Therefore, the label should be T.
