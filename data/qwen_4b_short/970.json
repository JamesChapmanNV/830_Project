Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "I've been sippin' on nothing but codeine the whole week 🍼🍇😻👅".

First, I need to check if this post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The key here is to identify if the post is directly related to drug use.

The word "codeine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. The phrase "sippin' on nothing but codeine" clearly indicates that the person is consuming codeine, which is an illicit drug. The use of "sippin'" is slang for drinking or consuming, so that's a strong indicator. Additionally, the emojis might be decorative, but the main content is the mention of codeine. 

Since codeine is a controlled substance and using it without a prescription is illegal, this post is directly showing drug use. Therefore, according to the label rules, this should be labeled as T.
