Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "If you don't like codeine crazy by future your not a true fan. I can't never skip that song". 

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key words here are "codeine crazy". Codeine is a controlled substance, classified as a Schedule II drug in the US. The term "crazy" might be a slang reference to the effects of codeine, which can cause hallucinations or euphoria. 

The phrase "codeine crazy" could be a metaphor, but given the context of the song "Future" by Drake, which has a track called "Codeine", the reference might be to the song's lyrics or the drug itself. However, the user's instruction says to look for any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. 

The post says "I can't never skip that song", which might be a reference to the song's content. But the main point here is the mention of "codeine crazy". Since codeine is a drug, and the post is using it in a context that could imply drug use (crazy), this might fall under T. However, I need to check if it's a metaphor or a direct reference. 

But the label rules include T if it's about drug use. Even if it's a metaphor, if the term is used in a way that refers to the drug, it might still be T. Alternatively, if the user is discussing the song's theme, which might involve drug use, then it's T. 

Wait, the user is moderating for drug abuse, so any mention of codeine, even in a song context, could be relevant. The phrase "codeine crazy" is a direct reference to the drug. So the label should be T. 

But I need to make sure. The post is talking about not liking the song because it's "codeine crazy", which could be a metaphor for the drug's effects. However, the term "codeine crazy" is a slang term for using codeine, so it's a direct reference. Therefore, the answer is T.
