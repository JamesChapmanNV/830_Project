Okay, let's tackle this labeling problem. The user is asking me to determine if the given social media post falls under category T (indicating illicit or abusive drug use) or F (other cases). The post says: "yep, I stopped drinking 8 1/2 yrs ago, strictly #Cannabis now, I don't miss a drop".

First, I need to understand the key elements here. The person mentions they stopped drinking 8.5 years ago and now use cannabis exclusively. They also say they don't miss a drop. The label rules specify that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

So, the main question is whether cannabis use here is considered illicit or abusive. In many places, cannabis is classified as a controlled substance, especially in the US where it's Schedule I. However, the user is using it as a substitute for alcohol, which they stopped. The post doesn't mention any illegal activities like selling or trafficking. It's more about personal use. 

But the label rule includes "slang for drugs". The hashtag #Cannabis is used, which is the common name for the drug. However, the user is not using slang, just the standard term. The key is whether the use is considered abusive. Since they're using it strictly and not missing a drop, maybe it's more of a medical or policy discussion? Wait, but the user is using it, so that's under T?

Wait, the rules say T includes "using" drugs. So if the person is using cannabis, that would be T. But the context is that they stopped drinking and now use cannabis. However, the label rules don't specify whether the use is for medical or recreational. The problem is whether cannabis is considered illicit. In some regions, cannabis is illegal, so using it would be T. But in others, it's legal. However, the user is using it as a substitute for alcohol, which they stopped. 

But the label rules don't mention legal status, just whether the text shows use. The post clearly states that the person is using cannabis. So according to the rules, that's T. However, the user might be using it in a way that's not considered abusive, but the label rules don't make that distinction. The rules are strict: any mention of drug use (including slang) is T. 

So the answer here is T. The person is using cannabis, which is a drug, so it's T.
