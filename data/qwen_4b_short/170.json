Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "It's been two years and I'm still confused how Codeine Crazy didn't win a Grammy."

First, I need to understand what the rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

So the key here is to check if the post mentions any drug-related terms that fall under the T category. The post mentions "Codeine Crazy." Codeine is a drug, right? It's an opioid, which is a controlled substance. But the term "Crazy" here is probably a slang or a metaphor. Wait, "Codeine Crazy" might be a reference to someone who uses codeine and is acting crazy, but is that a slang term for drug use?

Alternatively, "Codeine Crazy" could be a song title or a nickname. For example, there's a song by The Offspring called "Codeine," but I'm not sure about "Crazy." But the user is talking about Codeine Crazy not winning a Grammy. So maybe it's a reference to a person or a band named Codeine Crazy? Or maybe it's a metaphor for someone who's using codeine and is acting crazy.

But the main point is whether the post is indicating drug use. The term "Codeine" is a drug, but the phrase "Codeine Crazy" might be a metaphor. However, if "Crazy" is used as slang for drug use, then it could be T. But I need to check if "Codeine Crazy" is a slang term for using codeine. Alternatively, maybe the person is referring to someone who is using codeine and is acting crazy, which could be a metaphor for drug use.

But the post is about confusion why Codeine Crazy didn't win a Grammy. It's not directly stating that the person is using codeine, but the term "Codeine Crazy" might be a reference to someone who uses codeine. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But according to the rules, if the text shows drug use, then it's T. If it's just a metaphor or a reference, then it's F.

Alternatively, "Codeine Crazy" could be a song title. For example, there's a song called "Codeine" by The Offspring, but not sure about "Crazy." However, the user is talking about Codeine Crazy not winning a Grammy. Maybe it's a reference to a person or a band. But the key is whether the text shows drug use. If the term "Codeine" is used, which is a drug, but the phrase "Crazy" might be a metaphor. However, in some contexts, "crazy" could be slang for drug use. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, the person is using "Codeine Crazy" as a metaphor for someone who is using codeine and is acting crazy. But the post is not directly stating that the person is using codeine. It's more of a comment on why a certain entity (Codeine Crazy) didn't win a Grammy. So maybe it's a metaphor, not directly indicating drug use. Therefore, the label would be F. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if "Codeine Crazy" is a slang term for using codeine, then it's T. But I think in this case, it's more likely a metaphor, so F.
