Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Right? Fentanyl has been in the US for decades. It's prescribed a lot, including CHILDREN w/ cancer. It's called Actiq, this moron should know what he's talking about."

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. 

Looking at the post, the mention of Fentanyl is a key point. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid, often associated with illicit use. The user talks about it being prescribed to children with cancer, which is a medical use. However, the term "this moron should know what he's talking about" seems like a derogatory comment towards someone else's knowledge. 

But the main focus here is whether the text itself is about drug use. The post mentions Fentanyl's prescription, which is a medical use, but also refers to it as "Actiq," which is a brand name for a medication used to treat opioid withdrawal. However, the mention of "this moron" is a personal attack, not directly about drug use. 

Wait, but the question is whether the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The post is discussing Fentanyl's medical use, but the user is criticizing someone else's knowledge. The main content is about Fentanyl's presence and prescription, which is medical. However, the term "moron" is a slang term, but the main subject is the drug. 

But according to the rules, T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use. The post is discussing Fentanyl's medical use, but the user is also making a derogatory comment. However, the key part is the mention of Fentanyl and its prescription. Since it's a medical use, that's not T. However, the term "Fentanyl" is a drug, but the context is medical. The user is not using it illicitly. 

But wait, the user is talking about Fentanyl being prescribed to children with cancer, which is a medical use. The mention of Actiq is a specific medication. So the text is discussing medical use, not abuse. Therefore, the label should be F. However, the user is also using "this moron should know what he's talking about," which is a slang term, but that's a separate part. 

The main subject is Fentanyl's medical use. So the answer is F. Unless the mention of Fentanyl is considered as slang. But in this case, it's a drug name, not slang. So the correct label is F.
