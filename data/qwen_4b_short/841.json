Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is: "Got Promethzine & Codeine üçáüçº  All N My Belly #RIPSwiepy". 

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, which includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussions, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

Looking at the post, the key words here are "Promethzine" and "Codeine". Both of these are drugs. Promethzine is an antihistamine, but it's also used in some medications for cough or as a sedative. Codeine is an opioid, commonly used in pain relievers and cough suppressants. However, in some contexts, codeine can be abused. 

The user mentions "Got Promethzine & Codeine", which might imply that the person has these drugs. The phrase "All N My Belly" could be a slang way of saying they have them in their possession. The hashtag #RIPSwiepy might be a reference to someone named Swiepy, possibly a pet or a friend, with "RIP" indicating they've passed away. 

But wait, the question is about drug use. The post is about having these drugs, which are medications. However, if they're being used in a way that's considered illicit, like for non-medical purposes, then it would be T. But the presence of these drugs in the post could be seen as showing possession, which is related to drug use. 

However, the rules specify that T includes using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post doesn't explicitly mention using them, but just having them. But the user is moderating for drug abuse, so possession might be considered under the rules. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to medical use. But codeine is a controlled substance, and promethzine is also a controlled substance in some places. If the post is about having these drugs, even if they're for medical use, it might still be considered T. 

But the hashtag #RIPSwiepy might be a red herring. The main point is the drugs mentioned. The presence of codeine and promethzine in the text, even if they're in a medical context, could still be considered T if they are being used in a way that's illicit. 

Wait, the rules say "illicit or abusive drug use". So if the person is showing that they have these drugs, maybe it's considered T. But if they're just mentioning them as part of a medical context, maybe not. However, the hashtag #RIPSwiepy might be a clue that the person is referring to a death, which could be related to drug use. 

Alternatively, the user might be using "RIPSwiepy" as a metaphor, but the main focus is on the drugs. The presence of codeine and promethzine in the text would be T. 

So the answer is T.
