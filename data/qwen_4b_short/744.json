Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about someone's experiences with drug use. Let me break it down.

First, the post mentions using horses and having a lot of injuries over 35 years. Then it says they were on 480 mg of oxycodone and oxycontin for two years and morphine 3. The key here is to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. 

Oxycodone and oxycontin are both prescription opioids, which are controlled substances. The mention of taking them for two years and the dosage (480 mg) suggests long-term use. However, the context here is medical, as they're using them for pain management related to injuries from horse riding. But the rules specify that T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." 

Wait, the post doesn't mention seeking, buying, selling, or trafficking. It's more about the medical use of prescription drugs. However, the presence of high doses over a long period might be considered abusive use. But according to the label rules, F is for medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor. 

But the user is moderating for drug abuse. The question is whether the post is showing illicit use. Since the drugs mentioned are prescription medications, not illicit drugs, but the person is using them for a long time. However, the rules might consider prescription drugs as part of drug use. Wait, the label rules say T is for "illicit or abusive drug use." So if they're using prescription drugs in an abusive way, even if they're legal, does that count as T? Or is it only for illicit drugs?

The original instruction says T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the person is using prescription drugs in a way that's considered abuse, maybe that's T. But the post is about medical use. The user is on oxycodone and oxycontin for pain management. But the fact that they took 480 mg for two years might be considered abuse. However, the label rules might differentiate between medical use and abuse. The problem is that the rules don't specify whether prescription drugs are considered T unless they're being used in a way that's considered abuse. 

But the post doesn't mention anything about seeking, buying, selling, trafficking. It's about the person's medical use. However, the presence of high doses over a long period might be considered abuse. But according to the label rules, F is for medical/policy discussion. So if the post is about medical use, even if it's long-term, maybe it's F. But the question is whether it's considered abusive. 

Alternatively, maybe the fact that they are on prescription drugs for a long time is considered T. But the rules are a bit ambiguous here. The key is that the post is about their own use of drugs. The user is on 480 mg of oxycodone and oxycontin. The label rules say T is for showing illicit or abusive drug use. So if the person is using these drugs in an abusive way, even if they are prescription, it would be T. But if it's for medical purposes, then F. 

But the post is a personal account of their medical use. The user is not seeking or buying, but using them for pain management. However, the high dosage and long duration might be considered abusive. But the rules might not consider prescription drugs as T unless they are being used in a way that's considered illicit. 

Alternatively, maybe the presence of prescription drugs in the post is considered T if it's related to drug abuse. But I'm a bit confused. The rules say T is for "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the person is using prescription drugs, that's "using," which is part of T. But if it's for medical use, is that considered T? Or is F for medical discussions? 

Wait, the label rules say F is for all other cases, including medical/policy discussion. So if the post is about medical use, even if it's prescription drugs, it's F. But the problem is that the person is using a high dose for a long time. However, the rules don't specify that. The post is about their personal experience with drug use, but it's for medical purposes. So the label would be F. But I need to check again.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that they are on prescription drugs for a long time is considered abusive. But the rules might not consider that. The user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the post shows drug use (even if it's prescription), it's T. But the label rules say F includes medical/policy discussion. So if the post is about medical use, even if it's prescription, it's F. 

So the answer is F. But I need to be careful. The post mentions using oxycodone and oxycontin, which are prescription drugs. The user is on them for two years. But the rules for T are for illicit or abusive drug use. If the use is for medical purposes, then it's F. But if the use is considered abusive (even if it's prescription), then T. 

But the rules don't specify that prescription drugs are T. The rules say T includes "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." So if the person is using prescription drugs, that's "using," which is part of T. However, the label rules say F includes medical/policy discussion. So maybe the post is considered F because it's a medical discussion. 

But the user is on prescription drugs for pain management, which is a medical use. So the label would be F. But the presence of high dosage and long-term use might be considered abuse. However, the rules don't specify that. The answer is F.
