Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "Crock-Pot Codeine Presents: Imagination (RIP Gene Wilder)".

First, I need to understand what the rules are. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the main elements are "Crock-Pot Codeine" and "Imagination (RIP Gene Wilder)". The term "Codeine" is a drug, specifically an opioid. But the context here is a bit tricky. "Crock-Pot Codeine" might be a reference to a band or a project name. The phrase "Presents: Imagination" could be a title of a track or a performance. The mention of "RIP Gene Wilder" is a tribute to the actor, which is a common way to honor someone who has passed away.

Now, the key is whether "Codeine" here is being used in the context of drug use. If "Crock-Pot Codeine" is a band name, then it's probably a metaphorical or artistic reference, not actual drug use. However, if the band is named after the drug, it might be considered as using the drug's name in a way that could imply abuse. But the presence of "RIP Gene Wilder" suggests that the post is a tribute or a memorial, not a direct reference to drug use.

Alternatively, maybe the post is a metaphorical or artistic expression. The term "Codeine" in the band name could be a nod to the drug, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the rules specify that if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, it's T. If it's just using the drug's name in a non-illlicit context, like a band name, then it might be F.

But wait, the user is moderating social media posts for drug abuse. So even if the name is a band, if the name includes a drug, does that count? The rules mention "slang for drugs" as part of T. So if "Codeine" is being used as a slang term, then it's T. But in this case, "Crock-Pot Codeine" is likely a band name, not a slang term. The use of "Codeine" here is probably not indicating drug use but rather a reference to the drug's name in a creative context.

But the problem is that "Codeine" is a real drug, and if the band is named after it, does that count as showing drug use? The rules might consider that if the text is using the drug's name in a way that could be associated with drug use. However, the presence of "RIP Gene Wilder" might be a red herring. The main point is whether the text is showing illicit or abusive drug use. Since the post is a tribute to Gene Wilder, and the band name is "Crock-Pot Codeine", it's more likely that this is a metaphorical or artistic reference, not actual drug use. Therefore, the label would be F.

Wait, but maybe "Crock-Pot Codeine" is a play on words. "Crock-Pot" is a kitchen appliance, and "Codeine" is a drug. So combining them might be a metaphor, but not necessarily showing drug use. The mention of "Imagination" could be a song title. The "RIP" is a tribute. So overall, this seems like a non-illlicit context. Therefore, the answer is F.
