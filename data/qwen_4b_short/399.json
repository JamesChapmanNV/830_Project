Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about Demi Lovato and her music video, mentioning overdose, addiction, and survivor's guilt.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "overdose," "addiction," and "survivor's guilt." These are related to drug abuse. The user is talking about her music video making a spectacle of these issues, which are directly connected to drug use. The mention of "survivor's guilt" is a term often associated with people who have used drugs and survived an overdose, so that's a strong indicator. The post isn't just discussing medical aspects or policy; it's about the personal struggles related to drug abuse. The word "fucking weird and unnecessary" is more of a subjective reaction, but the main content is about drug-related issues. So according to the rules, this should be labeled T.
