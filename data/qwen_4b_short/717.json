Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F. The post is about a song with some names in the title. The names mentioned are "ILL_ Dont Like Us _Migo _Codeine_ LBPimpin (Millzmadedabeat) by Pimpinslethallit #np on #SoundCloud". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The labels T is for when the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. 

Looking at the names: "Codeine" is a drug, right? Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. So if the song title includes "Codeine", that might be a clue. But wait, sometimes artists or songs use names that are just part of the title or a reference. But in this case, "Codeine" is in the title. 

But the user is moderating for drug abuse, so if the text is showing drug use, then it's T. However, the post is just a link to a song. The title includes "Codeine", which is a drug. But is that considered showing drug use? Or is it just the name of the song? 

Wait, the label rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. So if the text includes the name of a drug, that's T. But maybe the song is named after the drug, not necessarily that the song is about using it. But the label rules might be strict. 

Alternatively, maybe "Codeine" is part of the artist's name or a track name. But in this case, the user is supposed to check if the text shows drug use. So if the text includes the name of a drug, then it's T. 

But I need to be careful. The post is just the title of the song. The user is supposed to check if the text shows drug use. The presence of "Codeine" in the title might be considered as showing drug use. Therefore, the label would be T. 

But wait, maybe "Codeine" is a slang term or part of the track's name. However, according to the rules, if the text includes the name of a drug, it's T. So the answer here is T.
