Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is about a book titled "Brewing with Cannabis" by Dr. Keith Villa, promoting it as a gift for craft beer and cannabis enthusiasts on #420. It mentions recipes and guidance for creating non-alcohol beer or homebrew.

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is whether the post is discussing the use of drugs. The book is about brewing cannabis-infused beer, which is a form of cannabis use. However, the post specifies "non-alcohol beer," which might be a key point. But wait, cannabis is still a drug, so even if it's non-alcoholic, the content is about using cannabis in beer. 

The rules mention "using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs." The post is promoting a book that includes recipes for cannabis-infused beer. That seems like using cannabis, which would fall under T. But wait, the book is for homebrewing, which is a hobby. However, the act of using cannabis in beer is still drug use. 

But maybe the label is about whether the text directly shows drug use. The post is promoting a book that's about making cannabis beer, which is a form of drug use. So the label should be T. However, the user might consider that it's a craft or hobby, not illicit. But according to the rules, any mention of using, seeking, buying, etc., would be T. Since the book is about creating cannabis-infused beer, that's using cannabis. So the answer is T. But wait, the post says "non-alcohol beer," but that's just the type of beer, not the drug. The main point is that the book is about using cannabis in brewing. Therefore, the label is T.
