Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F based on specific rules. The post is about someone being a "big grunge guy" in the 90s, living in the Pacific Northwest, and mentioning Eddie Veder's voice and comparing it to Michael Stipe on heroin.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "grunge," which is a music genre, and the mention of Michael Stipe "on heroin." Wait, the user is comparing Eddie Veder's voice to Michael Stipe's mumbling while on heroin. So the post is using a metaphor here, right? The person isn't actually saying they used heroin, but is using it as a metaphor to describe the mumble in Stipe's voice. 

The rules say T is for text that shows drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang). F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor. The post here is using a metaphor, comparing the voice to someone on heroin. There's no actual mention of using drugs, just a metaphor. So according to the rules, this should be labeled F. The mention of heroin is part of the metaphor, not a direct statement of drug use. So the answer is F.
