Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label this social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post mentions Raven grooming and beating Zainy, buying him a phone, going through his messages, and telling him what to tweet about fake rape allegations. Then it says "Go do what you do best and shoot up heroin and take another ahegao selfie, egirl."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use. The phrase "shoot up heroin" clearly refers to using heroin, which is an illicit drug. Also, "ahegao" is a slang term related to drug use, often associated with hallucinogens. The mention of "egirl" might be a term of endearment or a self-identifier, but the key part here is the drug references.

The rest of the post talks about grooming, beating, and spreading fake rape allegations, which are violent and harmful, but according to the rules, those are not drug-related. The main drug-related parts are "shoot up heroin" and "ahegao," which are T. The other parts are F because they're about abuse and violence, not drug use. So the label should be T.
