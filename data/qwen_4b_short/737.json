Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking me to label a social media post as either T or F based on specific rules. The post is about PST, which they mention isn't a true tea but a method to extract morphine and codeine. The label rules say T if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use, like using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. Otherwise, it's F.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any of those drug-related activities. The post talks about PST being a method to extract morphine and codeine. Morphine and codeine are opioids, which are controlled substances. The mention of extracting them could imply processing or manufacturing drugs, which might relate to trafficking or illegal drug production. However, the post also mentions it's not a true tea or tisane, which might be a reference to a specific product or method. 

But wait, the key here is whether the text shows drug use. The post is explaining what PST is, not necessarily using it. It's more about the method of extraction. However, if PST is a method to extract morphine and codeine, that could be related to drug trafficking or illegal drug production. But the post itself doesn't explicitly state that PST is being used for illegal purposes. It's more of an explanation of what PST is. 

Alternatively, if PST is a slang term for a drug, then that would be T. But the user says PST is not a true tea or tisane, so maybe it's a product used in drug extraction. However, the post doesn't mention using it for drug use, just explaining its method. The mention of morphine and codeine are drugs, but the post is describing a method, not the act of using or selling them. 

So, the label would be F unless the text is explicitly about drug use. Since the post is explaining PST as a method to extract morphine and codeine, which are drugs, but not necessarily indicating that PST is being used for drug use. The post is more about the extraction method, not the use. Therefore, the label is F. But wait, if the method is part of drug trafficking, then maybe T. But the post doesn't state that PST is being used for trafficking. It's just explaining what PST is. So the answer is F.
