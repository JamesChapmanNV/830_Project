Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: "*Codeine Crazy, March Madness, How Can I Not, Rotation, No Charge". 

First, I need to check if the text mentions illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to look for any mention of drugs, their use, or related terms. The first word is "Codeine". Codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance and considered an illicit drug in many contexts. The phrase "Codeine Crazy" might be a metaphor, but the presence of the drug name itself is a red flag. 

Next, the other parts of the post: "March Madness" is a sports event, "How Can I Not" could be a question, "Rotation" might refer to something else like a medical rotation or a sports rotation, and "No Charge" could be a phrase used in various contexts. However, the mention of Codeine is the critical part here. 

The rules state that T is for any text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including slang. Even if the rest of the post doesn't mention drugs, the presence of "Codeine" would trigger the T label. 

I should also consider if "Codeine Crazy" is a slang term. Sometimes people use phrases like "codeine crazy" to describe a state of being high or affected by the drug. However, the main point is that the term "Codeine" is present, which is a drug. Therefore, the label should be T.
