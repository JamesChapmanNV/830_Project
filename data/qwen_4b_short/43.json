Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about San Francisco allowing legal cannabis sales at a 4/20 celebration for the first time.

First, I need to recall the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphors.

The post here is about legal cannabis sales. The key points are that it's legal, and it's a celebration. The term "cannabis" is mentioned, but since it's legal in this context, it's not about illicit use. The 4/20 celebration is a reference to cannabis use, but the post is about allowing legal sales. There's no mention of using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang. Instead, it's a news story about a policy change. So the content is about legal cannabis, which is a policy or news topic. Therefore, according to the rules, this should be labeled F. The user might be testing if I can distinguish between legal and illicit contexts. The answer is F.
