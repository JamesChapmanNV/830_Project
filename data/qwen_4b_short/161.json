Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about the legalization of cannabis in New York and California, mentioning that legalization put 75% of mom & pop pot growers out of business in CA.

First, I need to check if the post shows illicit or abusive drug use. The key terms here are "cannabis," "legalization," "mom & pop pot growers." The mention of growers might imply drug use, but the context is about the impact of legalization. The post is discussing the effects of legalization on businesses, not directly about using or seeking drugs. The term "pot" is slang for cannabis, which is a drug. However, the post is more about the economic impact of legalization rather than promoting or discussing drug use. The user's rules state that T is for text showing drug use (using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang). The post does mention selling (growers), but the focus is on the consequences of legalization. Since the main topic is about the effects of legalization on businesses, not about the act of using or seeking drugs, it might be F. But wait, the term "pot growers" could be considered as selling, which is part of the T category. However, the post is not promoting or discussing the use of drugs, but rather the impact of legalization. The label rules say T if it shows drug use, so if the post is discussing selling (which is part of drug trafficking), then it's T. But the post is more about the outcome of legalization, not the act of using. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The user's example includes "selling" as part of T. So if the post mentions selling, then it's T. However, the post is talking about the effect of legalization on growers, which is about the business side. But the term "growers" is part of the drug trade. So maybe it's T. Alternatively, if the post is discussing the consequences of legalization without directly promoting or discussing the use, it might be F. But according to the rules, any mention of selling, trafficking, etc., would be T. So the post does mention "growers," which is part of the drug trade. Therefore, the label should be T. Wait, but the post is not about the use, but the impact of legalization. The rules say T if the text shows drug use, which includes selling. So even if it's discussing the effects, if it's about selling, then it's T. So the answer is T.
