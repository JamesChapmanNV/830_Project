Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to label a social media post as T or F based on the given rules. The post is: "Who is he, other than a two bit drug dealer". The rules are that T is for text showing illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical/policy discussion, news, discouraging use, metaphor.

First, I need to analyze the sentence. The key part here is "two bit drug dealer". "Drug dealer" directly refers to someone involved in selling drugs, which falls under the definition of T. The term "two bit" is a slang term, often used to mean a small amount or a cheap, low-quality thing. But in this context, it's modifying "drug dealer", so the main term is "drug dealer". 

So, the post is directly mentioning someone as a drug dealer. According to the rules, that would be T. Even though "two bit" is slang, the overall phrase "drug dealer" is a clear indicator of T. The other parts of the sentence, "Who is he, other than..." are just framing the statement, but the key part is the label "drug dealer".

I should check if there's any possibility of metaphor. But "drug dealer" is a direct term, not a metaphor. So, it's definitely T. Therefore, the answer should be T.
