Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is: ""I'm not a rapper I'm a drug dealer that raps" Man took these lines too serious".

First, I need to check if the text shows illicit or abusive drug use. The rules mention using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The person says they're a drug dealer, which directly relates to selling drugs. Also, they mention rapping, but the key part here is the identification as a drug dealer. The phrase "drug dealer that raps" combines both drug dealing and rap. The second part says "Man took these lines too serious," which might imply that someone took the statement seriously, but the main content is the person's self-identification as a drug dealer. 

So, according to the label rules, since the person is identifying as a drug dealer, that's trafficking or selling drugs. Even though they are a rapper, the key point here is the drug dealing aspect. The statement directly mentions being a drug dealer, which falls under the T category. The fact that they also rap might be a metaphor, but the main action here is the drug dealing. Therefore, the label should be T.
