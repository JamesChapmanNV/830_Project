Okay, let's see. The user wants me to label the given social media post as T or F based on the rules provided. The post is about college football players in the Big 12 conference, discussing their transfer status and whether they're considered program changers.

First, I need to check if the post mentions any illicit or abusive drug use. The keywords to look for are using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. The post talks about players transferring and their impact on the team, but there's no mention of drugs at all. The terms used are related to sports, transfers, and team performance. 

The user is comparing the players to All-Big 12 players and discussing their transfer status. There's no reference to drug-related activities, slang, or any other indicators of drug use. The context is purely about sports and player movement between teams. 

Since there's no mention of drugs or related terms, the label should be F. The post falls under other cases, like a sports discussion, which doesn't involve drug abuse. I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden slang or metaphors, but the language here is straightforward and sports-related. No metaphors that could imply drug use. 

Therefore, the correct label is F.
