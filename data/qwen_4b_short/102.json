Okay, let's see. The user is asking to label a social media post as T or F. The post is: "What drugs do you take? Heroin, cocaine like the ukrainian comedian?" 

First, I need to check the label rules. T is for text that shows illicit or abusive drug use, including using, seeking, buying, selling, trafficking, or slang for drugs. F is for other cases like medical discussion, news, discouraging use, or metaphor.

Looking at the post, the person is asking about drugs they take. They mention heroin and cocaine, which are both illicit drugs. The mention of "like the ukrainian comedian" might be a metaphor or a reference to someone, but the key part here is the explicit mention of heroin and cocaine. 

Heroin and cocaine are clearly classified as illicit drugs. The user is directly stating they take these drugs, which falls under T. Even if the comedian part is a metaphor, the drugs mentioned are still illicit. So the label should be T.
