Meprobamate can induce liver microsomal enzymes and thus may at least theoretically alter the metabolism of other drugs such as warfarin. There is some evidence that meprobamate may accelerate its own metabolism. Meprobamate metabolites are inactive and include 2B-hydroxymeprobamate, and glucosyluronide and glucuronide conjugates of meprobamate. These metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. About 10-12% of a dose of meprobamate is excreted in urine as unchanged drug within 24 hr.

While instances of clinically apparent liver injury due to meprobamate have been mentioned in review articles, no cases with specific information on clinical features have appeared in the published literature. Thus, meprobamate may be capable of causing clinically apparent liver injury, but it must be rare. Meprobamate is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system and has major potential for drug-drug interactions. Meprobamate can exacerbate symptoms of porphyria. Serious allergic reactions to meprobamate have been reported including Stevens Johnson syndrome. In cases of meprobamate overdose, the cause of death has been respiratory suppression and not liver failure, although liver histology was not well defined.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears under \"12 Toxicity\" and presents information on the potential liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity) of meprobamate, summarizing current knowledge on liver enzyme changes, liver injury cases, drug metabolism, and hypersensitivity reactions.

Vapor-phase meprobamate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 Â°C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).
