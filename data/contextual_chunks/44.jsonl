It started being used for veterinary purposes in Belgium and in 1964 was proven that compared to PCP, it produced minor hallucinogenic effects and shorter psychotomimetic effects. It was FDA approved in 1970, and from there, it has been used as an anesthetic for children or patients undergoing minor surgeries but mainly for veterinary purposes.\n\nKetamine is a General Anesthetic.

If skeletal muscle relaxation is needed, it should be combined with a muscle relaxant. If the surgical procedure involves visceral pain, it should be supplemented with an agent that obtunds visceral pain. Ketamine can be used for induction of anesthesia prior other general anesthetic agents and as a supplement of low potency agents. Reports have indicated a potential use of ketamine as a therapeutic tool for the management of depression when administered in lower doses.

However, significant side effects limit its routine use. Ketamine rapidly produces a hypnotic state quite distinct from that of other anesthetics. Patients have profound analgesia, unresponsiveness to commands, and amnesia, but may have their eyes open, move their limbs involuntarily, and breathe spontaneously. This cataleptic state has been termed dissociative anesthesia. The administration of ketamine has been shown to reduce the development of tolerance to long-term opioid use.

HUMAN STUDIES: Ketamine is a unique anesthetic because it has both hypnotic and analgesic effects and also potential hallucinogenic side effects. Lack of cardiopulmonary depression makes the drug a popular choice for anesthesia in the prehospital setting. In recent years ketamine has been found to have anti-hyperalgesic and opioid saving effects, opening to new ways of managing post-operative and chronic pain states.

Ketamine produces a variety of symptoms including, but not limited to, anxiety, dysphoria, disorientation, insomnia, flashbacks, hallucinations, and psychotic episodes.

Available data indicate that ketamine use in nursing mothers may not affect the breastfed infant or lactation. Until more data are available, ketamine should be used with careful infant monitoring of the infant for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.\n\n◉ Effects in Breastfed Infants\n\nFour mothers who received epidural analgesia with lidocaine and bupivacaine for cesarean section also received general anesthesia with ketamine and midazolam (dosages not specified). Their infants were either breastfed or received their mother's breastmilk by bottle. No adverse effects were reported in the infants.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from Section 12.1 “Toxicological Information” in the Safety and Hazards chapter, outlining ketamine’s chronic cognitive risks and its transfer into breast milk with guidelines for use during pregnancy and lactation.\n                "}
