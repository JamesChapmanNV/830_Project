It is a H1-receptor antagonist used as a antipruritic and antitussive drug. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, an antiemetic, a sedative, an anti-allergic agent, a muscarinic antagonist, an antiparkinson drug, an antipruritic drug, a local anaesthetic, an antidyskinesia agent, an antitussive and a oneirogen.

However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for \"night time\" use.

The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone. Such receptor sites may be found in the gut, uterus, large blood vessels, bronchial muscles, and elsewhere. Anti-emetic action is by inhibition at the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAntiemetics\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from section 8 “Pharmacology and Biochemistry” of the PubChem diphenhydramine entry, citing Gosselin et al. and detailing its pharmacodynamics (H₁-receptor antagonism with anti-histaminic, antiemetic, anti-vertigo and sedative actions) and its MeSH classification as an antiemetic.\n                "}

However, suckling-induced prolactin secretion is not affected by antihistamine pretreatment of postpartum mothers. Whether lower oral doses of diphenhydramine have the same effect on serum prolactin or whether the effects on prolactin have any consequences on breastfeeding success have not been studied.

Short-term or occasional use of diphenhydramine is not expected to increase the chance of side effects during breastfeeding.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 0.13 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Diphenhydramine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Diphenhydramine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).\n\n(1) Meylan WM, Howard PH; Chemosphere 26: 2293-99 (1993)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the Ecological Information section (12.2.6) of the Diphenhydramine compound summary, where its abiotic degradation is described—citing Meylan & Howard (1993) for the OH-radical reaction rate and atmospheric half-life (≈0.13 days) and Lyman et al.
