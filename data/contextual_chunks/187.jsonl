It usually seen in capsule form, in pressed pills, or as loose powder. Average cost ranges from $10-$30 (U.S.) a dose. Common routes of administration are swallowing or snorting, although it can be smoked or injected as well. Currently, MDMA is on the U.S. Schedule I of controlled substances, and is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell in the United States. Most other countries have similar laws. According to Nicholas Saunders (1993), \"MDMA was patented as long ago as 1913 by the German company Merck. [...] The patent doesn't mention uses.\" See PIHKAL (Shulgin & Shulgin 1991) or Shulgin 1986 for more history, including how Alexander Shulgin brought the drug to the attention of psychotherapists in the 1970s.\n\nDosing:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section introduces the general background of MDMA, including its common names, chemical nature, physical appearance, methods of administration, legal status, typical cost, and brief historical context.

Response to the drug is not strictly proportional to body weight. When MDMA is taken by mouth, the effects manifest about 30-45 minutes later; snorting, smoking or injecting produces much quicker onset. The primary effects usually reach a plateau at T+1:00 (one hour after taking the dose) to T+1:30, stay there for some two hours, then start tapering gradually. The primary effects are pretty much over by T+4:00 to T+6:00. Secondary effects (afterglow) may be felt for days, and tertiary psychological effects (e.g. improved outlook) may last indefinitely.

The same warning applies to people who are hypersensitive to drugs. Liver or kidney problems may also contraindicate MDMA use. It is, of course, desirable to hear from your physician that you're in good overall health before ingesting any powerful substance.

This can remarkably diminish one's ability to make sound judgements during the session. Examples:\n\nIt becomes easy to want to prolong the MDMA state by taking more and more of the drug (or of other drugs), beyond what you would judge wise or worthwhile when not under its influence.\n\nIt becomes easier to have unsafe sex. You may \"forget,\" judge that the risk of infection is very small, or feel that infection wouldn't be such a terrible thing after all. If you think you might have sex while on MDMA, it may help you and your partner to stay safe if you lay out safer sex supplies before dosing in a place you'll be sure to see them later, and agree beforehand that you'll use them if the occasion arises.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section is part of the comprehensive \"MDMA Frequently Asked Questions\" document, specifically within the \"Safety and Neurotoxicity Discussion\" chapter.

Combined with the extra energy the drug gives, it becomes easy to sustain bruises, blisters, or other bodily damage from extensive dancing, hiking, climbing, etc., without noticing it until after the damage is done. Under MDMA, it may seem \"right\" to make immediate changes in relationships (increasing or decreasing commitment) of all kinds.

It is useful if trip guides or trip buddies remind each other to drink water often. For those who are concerned about the possibility of serotonin level or serotonin system changes in humans with therapeutic doses of MDMA, some researchers reckon changes can be lessened or prevented by taking antioxidants. In an article titled \"Phenethylamines, Free Radicals, and Antioxidants\" (MAPS Newsletter, Volume IV Number 1), author Brian Leibovitz suggests in Table 1 taking as a preventive measure the following: 5 mg B-Carotene; 2 grams Bioflavonoids; 100 mg Coenzyme Q10; 2-4 grams L-Ascorbic acid; 1 gram L-Carnitine; 2 grams N-Acetylcysteine (NAC); 250 ug Selenium, and 1,000 IU Vitamin E. \"There is nothing magic about the doses listed; it is my best estimate based on present knowledge in nutrition.\"\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage appears in the \"Preventive Measures\" section of the Erowid MDMA FAQ, which discusses harm reduction strategies for MDMA use.

Clinical Psychopharmacology, 13 (3):pp. 214-217, 1993). One might speculate that other SSRI drugs (Zoloft, Paxil) may work too.

Thus a conservative, prudent assumption is that the risk of some kind of subtle neurological \"damage\" in humans from MDMA use is not zero. Yet there is no behavioral evidence of neurological harm in humans (and there is considerable evidence of psychological benefits) - this in many years of legal use (before 1985 in the US), and quite widespread illegal use since then. Given any non-zero risk, it makes sense to examine the benefit side of the equation, and take the drug only when you expect to get some tangible positive outcome from it that you feel makes taking the risk worthwhile.\n\nIV.

To get MDP-2-P first a natural source of safrole is acquired. Safrole can be extracted from sassafras oil, nutmeg oil, or several other sources which have been abundantly documented in _Chemical Abstracts_ over the years. The safrole is then easily isomerized into isosafrole when heated with NaOH or KOH. The isosafrole is then oxidized into MDP-2-P. This latter procedure has been most clearly presented in _Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved_ by Alexander Shulgin under synthesis #109 (MDMA). The synthesis of MDP-2-P from isosafrole will require the use of a vacuum pump to evaporate the solvent from the final product in vacuo. An aspirator will not, unfortunately, be sufficient.

The other method uses HBr to produce 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-bromopropane which is then converted into MDA or MDMA. This scheme produces poor yields, and Dal Cason referenced the australian journal _ANALOG_ where a hazard had been documented. It is, however, attractive for its sheer simplicity. It requires no specialized chem equipment or reagents at all. Beta-nitroisosafrole is a less used precursor, but there is a large literature on the synthesis and reduction of nitro alkenes. This synthetic route isn't as popular due to the easier availability of precursors for MDP-2-P, and it also results in MDA which must then be further processed to give MDMA or any other N-alkyl homolog of MDA. There are numerous ways to convert beta-nitroisosafrole to MDA: LiAlH4, AlH3, electrolytic, Na(Hg), BH3 - THF / NaBH4, Raney Ni catalyst, Pd / BaSO4 catalyst, Zn (Hg). Beta-nitroisosafrole, when used, is commonly synthesized from piperonal.

It is not recommended that any persons engage in this activity, but it remains a common source of methylamine (along with many other chemicals). Methylamine can be synthesized through hydrolyzing N-methylacetamide via refluxing it with concentrated HCl.
