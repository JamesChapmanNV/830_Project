Hydrocodone and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called a phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen-containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13, with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.\n\nHydrocodone, along with other morphinans, contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R4 and R5 through an oxygen group. It contains a carbonyl group bound at R6 and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R17. The carbon-oxygen double bond of the carbonyl saturates the benzene ring it is bonded with, thus hydrocodone lacks the double bond on that ring found in codeine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is from the middle of the Hydrocodone page, marking the transition from subjective effect sections (including experience reports) into more technical aspects such as toxicity, dependence, dangerous interactions, legal status, and chemistry.

Hydrocodone is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, heroin, ethylmorphine, codeine, and oxycodone.\n\nPharmacology\n\nThe euphoria, anxiety suppression and pain relief effects appear to stem from the way in which opioids mimic endogenous endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's effects. It acts primarily on μ-opioid receptors, with about six times lesser affinity to δ-opioid receptors.\n\nIn the liver, hydrocodone is transformed into several metabolites. It has a serum half-life that averages 3.8 hours.[4] The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 converts it into hydromorphone, a more potent opioid.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section bridges the chemistry and pharmacology of hydrocodone, first noting its structural similarities to codeine and other morphinans, then describing its mechanism of action, metabolic pathway in the liver, and receptor targets responsible for its effects.\n                "}
