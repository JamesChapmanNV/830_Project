Estimates of what could be a potentially lethal dose of LSD are higher than 10 mg orally, a dose that is more than 100 times the common, moderate dose of LSD (100 ug). The administration of this amount would require the ingestion of more than 200 units of street blotter, which typically contain about 50 ug of LSD (as of late 2010). It is important to note that LSD has been associated with deaths as a result of inebriated behavior (falling from a height or fighting with police) or by suicide.

Experts dispute whether LSD use has been solidly linked to depression resulting in intentional suicide. See LSD Death: Suicide. LSD use, even in the context of formal psychotherapy, has been reported to trigger short-term or lasting depressions in some people.14 LSD psychotherapy researchers in the 1950s and 1960s regularly identified depression following an LSD experience in articles discussing its use. Betty Eisner and Sidney Cohen wrote: \"We have observed that a transient depression sometimes follows an LSD-25 session. This may be due to several factors: (1) the inability to integrate all of the unacceptable traumatic material uncovered during the session; (2) the feeling that the necessary effort is too great to be undertaken; (3) \"coming back to earth\" after a transcendent experience. It is therefore important that some sympathetic person be with the patient during the evening following treatment.

This effect is not reversible by taking a higher dose of LSD or by going off the antidepressant for a day or two. It generally appears to take weeks or a month off of an SSRI or MAOI before the full psychedelic response returns. However, it is not advisable to stop taking an antidepressant that is effective just to have an LSD experience.20 As opposed to the diminished effect resulting from chronic use, there have been some reports that the accute use of a MAOI in combination with LSD increases the psychoactive effects; this could be viewed as a sort of ayahuasca-like effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is from the \"Health\" section of the Erowid LSD (Acid) overview, specifically under the \"Warnings\" about interactions between LSD and antidepressant medications.

It is also not likely to lead to psychological dependence in most people, although there are a few reports of individuals who have taken it daily for months. As with most substances, a few people have reported developing a bad relationship with LSD, where they continue to use the drug despite adverse consequences in their lives. Tolerance (a reduction in response after taking the same dose of a drug on a subsequent occasion) begins with a single dose of LSD, due to a reduction (\"down-regulation\") of serotonin 5HT2 receptors.
