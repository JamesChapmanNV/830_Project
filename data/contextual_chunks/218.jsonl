Strassman, personal communication). A .45 mg/kg dose would be around 30 mg for a 150 pound person.\n\nFischer and Thatcher administered .16 mg/kg to subjects and described it as \"mildly hallucinogenic\" and \"a dose which in most cases induces mild hallucinations in only some subjects\".

However, word choice could get in the way here: 'moderate' may mean many things. Leary, later in the same paper, says \"Psilocybin produces temporary states of spiritual conversion, interpersonal closeness and psychological insight. Forty-five percent of the entire inmate group clearly underwent a mystical, transcendent, death-rebirth experience. This figure should be modified, however. The results for running sessions improved so that 100% of our recent groups were undergoing transcendent experiences.\" The term 'moderate' must be read in the context where 100% of those moderate doses precipitated \"transcendent\" experiences.
