This occurs due to the way in which opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's euphoric, analgesic (pain relief), and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects.\n\nOxymorphone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic related to hydromorphone. It affects the central nervous system and smooth muscles by activation of specific opiate receptors. Hydromorphone and oxymorphone are semisynthetic derivatives of morphine and potent opiate agonists which are used predominantly to treat moderate-to-severe pain.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This \"Pharmacology\" section explains how oxymorphone acts as a μ-opioid receptor agonist, mimicking endorphins to produce pain relief, euphoria, and anxiolysis. Positioned after the chemistry overview and before subjective effects, it provides essential information on oxymorphone's mechanism of action, its relation to other opioids like hydromorphone and morphine, and its use as a potent analgesic for moderate-to-severe pain.\n                "}

When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of oxymorphone develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. Oxymorphone presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of oxymorphone all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section follows a discussion of oxymorphone’s toxicity and harm potential, highlighting the importance of harm reduction, and introduces information about the drug’s high addiction risk and rapid tolerance development—key aspects of its long-term safety profile and dependence potential.\n                "}
