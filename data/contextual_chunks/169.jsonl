However, other chemicals such as ethylone, methylone, and MDPV are often sold as \"molly\".\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is the introductory section of Erowid's MDMA information page, summarizing key facts about MDMA—including its common names, classification, chemical name, description of effects, and a caution about the prevalence of adulterated ecstasy or \"molly\" in the drug market—immediately preceding deeper links to related basics, effects, images, health, law, dosage, chemistry, and general information on MDMA.\n                "}
