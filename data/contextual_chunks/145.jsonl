Contraindications and Combinations Ketamine should not be used in combination with respiratory depressants, primarily alcohol, barbiturates, or Valium. Ketamine has been used without negative interaction effects with cannabis, LSD, nitrous oxide, dextromethorphan, and MDMA, although combinations are not recommended and are generally unnecessary given the strength of the ketamine experience.

Food should not be consumed within an hour and a half before the trip, and should be avoided for longer periods of time if possible. Nausea is likely and more pronounced when users try to get up and move around within the first 90 minutes after injection. A peculiar sort of loneliness can occur, so many people prefer to be with people they are close to. It is best to have a sober monitor or experienced user at hand.

While not common, it is not unusual for people to fall into patterns of use much higher than they expected. John Lilly is a classic example of a person who ended up using A LOT of ketamine, but there are many others. Using once per day or more may also cause long-term problems.

Mostly the dangers are more subtle - a type of psychic dependence on ketamine, paranoia, and egocentricism. Many people who use ketamine heavily experience a new perspective on the world which seems to be quite egocentric and conspiratorial. Ketamine can increase one's sense of connection between events, synchronicities, etc. This, when interpreted in certain common ways, can lead people to believe that external events revolve around themselves (\"if that happened that way, and this happened this way, both of these things must be about me\"), and then, further, that people and events are working in some heretofore unseen concert, which may be either sinister or just novel.

Ketamine and Bladder Health In some cases, chronic ketamine use has been associated with urinary tract symptoms that can include increased frequency of urination, urinary incontinence, pain during urination, passing blood in the urine, and reduced bladder size.

Nevertheless, frequent ketamine users may want to cut back on their use, and all ketamine users might want to moderately increase their intake of water and pay attention to even minor urinary symptoms.1 Ketamine and Breathing # Although part of ketamine's utility as an anaesthetic is that it does not suppress breathing as strongly as most other anaesthetic agents, it can cause some changes in breathing, including deeper, slower breathing and brief lapses in breathing rhythm. Primary breathing-related dangers with ketamine use are an unattended user inhaling ('aspirating') vomit or suffocating because they are so sedated and pain responses are suppressed.

According to a case report by Breitmeier et al., \"Ketamine induces characteristic changes in breathing patterns, causing both phases of deep, less frequent breaths with brief apnoeic episodes as well as phases of sighing inspirations with high tidal volumes and an end-inspiratory plateau. The apnoeic episodes are most likely a result of hyperventilation [37]. Ketamine is also associated with increased salivary and bronchial secretion, coughing and laryngospasms combined with raised laryngopharyngeal reflex and there can be a danger of aspiration in patients who do not have an empty stomach. Its effect of increasing intracranial pressure makes ketamine less suitable for use in patients with neurosurgical intervention.\"4 Ketamine-related Fatalities While fatalities with ketamine as the sole cause are rare, they are not unheard\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the respiratory risks and fatality potential associated with ketamine use, including dangers such as aspiration, changes in breathing patterns, and cases of death involving ketamine, particularly when combined with other depressant substances. It provides clinical observations and case reports to illustrate how ketamine can cause breathing irregularities, increased secretions, and makes recommendations regarding its use and associated hazards.\n                "}

Depressants such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB or alcohol can amplify ketamine's suppressant effects on breathing and heart rate, possibly causing cardiovascular and respiratory functions to slow dangerously or discontinue altogether. In one fatality case, where the death was attributed to ketamine in combination with another dissociative anaesthetic and tranquiliser known as Tylazol, the autopsy revealed cardiomegaly (enlargement of the heart) and hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen).5 In another case, asthma was listed as a joint cause of death along with ketamine,3 again most likely due to the respiratory suppressant effect of the substance.
