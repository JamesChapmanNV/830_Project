NO Tested for in Extended Drug Tests ? YES Possible to Test for? YES Detection Period in Urine 1-10 days\n\nTEST TYPES #\n\nUrine Testing\n\nMethadone does not show up in a basic opiate test that is part of the standard pre-employment drug test and which can detect heroin, codeine and morphine (and perhaps oxycodone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone). A methadone specific test must be performed to detect methadone. This test is not uncommon and is part of the second tier \"extended\" test done by many companies. Though the published information we've found suggests that methadone is not detectable after a few days, we have received reports from methadone maintenance users that they have been found methadone-positive on urine screens for 10-30 days after their last dose.\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information about methadone drug testing from Erowid's Chemicals Vault, explaining detection periods, the types of drug tests that include methadone, and clarifying that standard urine tests do not detect methadone unless a specific extended test is requested. It also notes variability in detection times and cautions that results may depend on individual factors.\n                "}
