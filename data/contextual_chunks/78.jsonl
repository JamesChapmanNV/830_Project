A fourth nitrogen-containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13 with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan. Codeine (along with other morphinans) contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R4 and R5 through an oxygen group.

However, others produce CYP2D6 enzymes in higher quantities which can result in hypersensitivity to the drug. Some methods of potentiating opioids, such as using grapefruit juice throughout the day before consumption, inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme.[6] This results in less codeine being converted into norcodeine which leaves more to be metabolized into morphine[citation needed]. This also indicates a lacking capability in the metabolism of codeine into morphine when a user consumes antihistamines such as diphenhydramine prior to the ingestion of codeine.
