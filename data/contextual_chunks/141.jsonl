A well-known effect of ketamine at higher-range doses is the \"K-hole\", where the user is removed from reality and set adrift in an introspective dream-like world, often involving complete dissociation, immersive visuals and out-of-body experiences. At higher doses, the user can be incapacitated and unresponsive, or uncoordinated and erratic, appearing unwell to the uninitiated eye. Nausea and vomiting may also be present. While ketamine is not known to be physically addictive, prolonged use could be tolerance-building as well as leading to psychological dependency.\n\nEXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears after listing ketamine’s negative effects and warnings, providing additional information about its general effects at different doses—including the “K-hole” experience, potential incapacitation, and risk of dependence—and is followed by firsthand user experience excerpts.\n                "}
