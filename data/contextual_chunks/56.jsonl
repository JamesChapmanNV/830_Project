It is a potent analgesic. Opioid analgesics exert their principal pharmacologic effects on the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Opioids produce respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAdjuvants, Anesthesia\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in the \"Pharmacology and Biochemistry\" section of the oxymorphone compound page, immediately following references to authoritative drug labeling sources.

These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Also, it has been shown that oxymorphone binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons via mu-receptors. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information about oxymorphone, specifically detailing its biological half-life (approximately 1.3 hours) and its mechanism of action at the molecular level. It describes how oxymorphone primarily acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist in the central nervous system, influencing pain modulation pathways. This information follows broader pharmacological data and precedes content on clinical use, safety, metabolism, and toxicology within the comprehensive profile of oxymorphone as an opioid analgesic.\n                "}

These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Also, it has been shown that oxymorphone binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons via mu-receptors. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream.\n\n12.1.2 Drug Induced Liver Injury\n\nCompound\n\noxymorphone\n\nDILI Annotation\n\nNo-DILI-Concern\n\nLabel Section\n\nNo match\n\nReferences\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Section 12 of the document focuses on the toxicity of oxymorphone, providing detailed toxicological information including its interaction with opioid mu-receptors, effects on the central nervous system, and toxicodynamics.

Maternal use of oral opioids during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, which may progress to rare but severe central nervous system depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics.[1] If oxymorphone is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral oxymorphone for 2 to 3 days at low dosages, with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately. Other agents are preferred over oxymorphone during breastfeeding.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Section 12 of the document provides toxicological information on oxymorphone, including health effects, toxicity data, symptoms, and special population risks.
