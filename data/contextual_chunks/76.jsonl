Flubromazepam is a member of the benzodiazepine class as it contains a 1,4 diazepine ring fused to a substituted benzene ring. Bromine is bound to this bicyclic structure at R7. Additionally, a fluorine-substituted phenyl ring is bound to this structure at R5. Flubromazepam also contains an oxygen group double bonded to R2 of its diazepine ring to form a ketone.

The exact pharmacological activity of Flubromazepam are not confirmed by verified data, but existing studies seem to suggest certain amounts anxiolytic, sedative, and muscle-relaxing potential.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) by acting on its receptors.[5] As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the sedating (or calming effects) of flubromazepam on the nervous system.\n\nThe anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors.[6]\n\nSubjective effects\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in the section detailing flubromazepam's pharmacology, directly after the chemistry section.

This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as barbiturates and alcohol since they work similarly, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABAA receptor. Thus their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABAA receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer[13].
