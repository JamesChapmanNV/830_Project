Because of this, the detection periods for MDMA are very similar to those for amphetamines. Also, many tablets of street ecstasy are not pure MDMA and frequently includes amphetamines (and may also contain DXM, caffeine, MDA, MDE, ephedrine etc) which may trigger drug tests. The U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT) added MDMA, MDA, and MDE to their amphetamine portion of their \"5 panel\" test. See DOT Drug Testing: On and After Oct 1, 2010 - Still a 5 Panel. Amphetamines are standardly detectable in urine for 24-96 hours after use (72 average). Methamphetamines stay in the system slightly longer, 24-120 hours.\n\nHair Testing\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on the types of drug tests that can detect MDMA use, specifically discussing how standard urine and hair tests may or may not identify MDMA, its relation to amphetamine testing, detection periods, and the impact of mixed substances often found in street ecstasy. It fits within an overall guide to MDMA drug testing, including detection windows, potential cross-reactions, and related drug testing information.\n                "}
