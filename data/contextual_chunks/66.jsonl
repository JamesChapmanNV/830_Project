While Zopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zopiclone binds selectively to the brain alpha subunit of the GABA A omega-1 receptor.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears after regulatory classification details and precedes MeSH pharmacological classification, providing an overview of zopiclone's pharmacodynamics. It describes zopiclone’s mechanism of action, chemical class, and therapeutic indication as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic for insomnia, emphasizing its interaction with GABA receptor complexes and relation to both its therapeutic and pharmacological properties.\n                "}

Both zopiclone and benzodiazepines act indiscriminately at the benzodiazepine binding site on alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 GABAA containing receptors as full agonists causing an enhancement of the inhibitory actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic (hypnotic and anxiolytic) and adverse effects of zopiclone.\n\n11.1.2 Carcinogen Classification\n\nCarcinogen Classification\n\nNo indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).\n\n11.1.3 Health Effects\n\nThey cause slurred speech, disorientation and \"drunken\" behavior.
