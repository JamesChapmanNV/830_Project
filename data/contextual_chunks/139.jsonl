It is generally injected intramuscularly, but can also be taken orally, rectally, or snorted. Much of the ketamine used recreationally is diverted from legitimate pharmaceutical sources in liquid form. Powdered ketamine is usually the result of drying liquid ketamine. Food should not be consumed within an hour and one-half before ketamine use, and should be avoided for longer periods of time if possible as nausea and vomiting are not uncommon. As always, it should be noted that dosages and reactions vary greatly depending on the individual.

The pain can continue for several days if it is not administered properly. The muscle soreness can be somewhat controlled by using a very fine needle (25-29 gauge) and by injecting very slowly. Too large a needle (low gauge) is painful. Too small a needle (high gauge) is too delicate and can bend. [Thanks to 2020 contributors who have helped us improve our info about preferred gauges.) It should take 10-30 or more seconds to inject a dose into a muscle. If you feel it begin to sting, slow down the injection rate.
