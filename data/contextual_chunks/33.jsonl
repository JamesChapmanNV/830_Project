The search for psychotherapeutic options for autistic individuals is imperative considering the lack of effective conventional treatments for mental health diagnoses that are common in this population. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) involving the administration of MDMA in clinical trials have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, MDMA has been administered to over 1133 individuals for research purposes without the occurrence of unexpected drug-related SAEs that require expedited reporting per FDA regulations.

Other CYP enzymes contributing to MDMA metabolism are CYP3A4 and COMT. MDMA is metabolized via two primary metabolic pathways. It may undergo O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation. In contrast, it may also undergo N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. Due to autoinhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2D8, MDMA displays a complex, nonlinear pharmacokinetics profile, with the zeroth order kinetics occurring at higher doses. It is thought that this can result in sustained and higher concentrations of MDMA if the user takes consecutive doses of the drug.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Section 8.4 (“Metabolism / Metabolites”) of the Pharmacology and Biochemistry chapter describes how MDMA (Midomafetamine) is processed in the body.

Once inside, MDMA inhibits the vesicular monoamine transporter, which results in increased concentrations of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine into the cytoplasm, and induces their release by reversing their respective transporters through a process known as phosphorylation. It also acts as a weak 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor agonist. MDMA's unusual entactogenic effects have been hypothesized to be, at least partly, the result of indirect oxytocin secretion via activation of the serotonin system. Oxytocin is a hormone released following events like hugging, orgasm, and childbirth, and is thought to facilitate bonding and the establishment of trust. Based on studies in rats, MDMA is believed to cause the release of oxytocin, at least in part, by both directly and indirectly agonizing the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from section 8.6 (“Mechanism of Action”) of the full MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) compound profile.

Ecstasy is the popular name for the illicit drug MDMA and is widely used at dance parties. It is usually consumed orally in tablet or capsule form. MDMA acts as both a stimulant and psychedelic, producing an energizing effect, as well as distortions in time and perception and enhanced enjoyment from tactile experiences. HUMAN STUDIES: Acute toxic effects of MDMA include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, metabolic acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and rhabdomyolysis. These effects can lead to multiorgan failure and death. The level of hyperthermia predicts the potential for survival. MDMA produces cardiovascular effects similar to those seen with methamphetamine, including an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Serious sequelae can occur from electrolyte abnormalities seen in MDMA abuse and overdose.

If patient is not breathing, start artificial respiration, preferably with a demand valve resuscitator, bag-valve-mask device, or pocket mask, as trained. Perform CPR if necessary. Immediately flush contaminated eyes with gently flowing water. Do not induce vomiting. If vomiting occurs, lean patient forward or place on the left side (head-down position, if possible) to maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration. Keep patient quiet and maintain normal body temperature. Obtain medical attention. /Poisons A and B/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from the “Toxicological Information” section (12.1) of the 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) compound page, specifically under the “Antidote and Emergency Treatment” subsection (12.1.4), immediately following the list of interaction studies.\n                "}
