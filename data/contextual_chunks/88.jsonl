These compounds exert their effects by binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptor. This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains the pharmacological mechanism of action of oxycodone, highlighting how it functions as a μ-opioid receptor agonist and mimics the effects of natural endorphins in the body, leading to its characteristic effects such as euphoria, pain relief, and anxiolysis.

Of these, oxymorphone is the active one. Anywhere from 5-19% of oxycodone is metabolized to oxymorphone, the rest being mostly noroxycodone (45-70%) and 6-oxycodols (~2-14%).
