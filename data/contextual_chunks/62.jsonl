The major hallucinogenic alkaloid isolated from Psilocybe mushrooms (also known as Teonanacatl or \"magic mushrooms\"). It has a role as a hallucinogen, a fungal metabolite, a prodrug and a serotonergic agonist. It is a tryptamine alkaloid, a tertiary amino compound and an organic phosphate. It is functionally related to a psilocin. It is a conjugate acid of a psilocybin(1-).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is the summary box at the top of the Psilocybin PubChem compound page, presenting essential identifiers, molecular structure images, core chemical information, safety notations, synonyms, molecular formula, weight, and a brief description of the compound’s nature and biological roles.
