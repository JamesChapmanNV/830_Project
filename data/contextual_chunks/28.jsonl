Used for treatment of neuropathic pain and restless legs syndrome. It has a role as an anticonvulsant, a calcium channel blocker, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is functionally related to a gamma-aminobutyric acid.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is the top‐of‐page summary box from PubChem’s compound record for gabapentin (CID 3446).

It was originally developed as a novel anti-epileptic for the treatment of certain types of seizures - today it is also widely used to treat neuropathic pain. Gabapentin has some stark advantages as compared with other anti-epileptics, such as a relatively benign adverse effect profile, wide therapeutic index, and lack of appreciable metabolism making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic drug interactions.. It is structurally and functionally related to another GABA derivative, [pregabalin].\n\nThe physiologic effect of gabapentin is by means of Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nGabapentin Enacarbil (active moiety of).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\nGabapentin.png\n\n1.2 3D Conformer\n\n1.3 Crystal Structures\n\n1 of 7\n\nView All\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Description section of the compound overview, summarizing gabapentin’s origin as a GABA analogue approved in 1993 for epilepsy and neuropathic pain, its pharmacological advantages and mechanism (“Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity”), and noting its relation to pregabalin and gabapentin enacarbil—immediately before the detailed “Structures” section.\n                "}

As the threshold dose that can cause hypoglycemia in dogs is approximately 100 mg/kg doses of up to 15 mg/kg in dogs using the solution should be safe, but further data is needed to confirm this Additionally, xylitol may be hepatotoxic in dogs. Doses of 500 mg/kg of xylitol are thought to be the threshold for this toxicity, but there have been anecdotal reports of it occuring at much lower doss.

It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats. Gabapentin is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used in caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. Gabapentin has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity. This reaction can prove fatal and early symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash should be promptly investigated.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAntimanic Agents\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Immediately after the safety warnings (with a note to see HSDB for the full set of 37 drug warnings), the document launches Section 8, “Pharmacology and Biochemistry.” Subsection 8.1 (“Pharmacodynamics”) explains gabapentin’s anticonvulsant action, wide therapeutic index, and rare hypersensitivity (DRESS), while 8.2 (“MeSH Pharmacological Classification”) lists its pharmacological classes (e.g., Antimanic Agents).\n                "}

As this process is saturable, the oral bioavailability of gabapentin is inversely proportional to the administered dose - the oral bioavailability of a 900mg/day regimen is approximately 60%, whereas a 4800mg/day regimen results in only 27% bioavailability. The Tmax of gabapentin has been estimated to be 2-3 hours. Food has no appreciable effect on gabapentin absorption.\n\nRoute of Elimination\n\nGabapentin is eliminated solely in the urine as unchanged drug. Cimetidine, an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion, reduces clearance by approximately 12%, suggesting that some degree of tubular secretion is involved in the renal elimination of gabapentin.\n\nVolume of Distribution\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    ATC classification (N02BF01 – gabapentinoids) and Section 8.5 “Absorption, Distribution and Excretion” from the gabapentin PubChem page, detailing LAT1-mediated, dose-dependent absorption (Tmax 2–3 h; bioavailability 60% at 900 mg vs. 27% at 4800 mg), renal elimination of unchanged drug, and volume of distribution.\n                "}

They exert their actions by binding to the alpha2delta (a2d) accessory subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Because these subunits interact with critical aspects of the neurotransmitter release process, gabapentinoid binding prevents transmission in nociceptive pathways. Gabapentinoids also reduce plasma membrane expression of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels but this may have little direct bearing on their therapeutic actions. In animal models of neuropathic pain, gabapentinoids exert an anti-allodynic action within 30 minutes but most of their in vitro effects are 30-fold slower, taking at least 17 hours to develop. This difference may relate to increased levels of a2d expression in the injured nervous system. Thus, in situations where a2d is experimentally upregulated in vitro, gabapentinoids act within minutes to interrupt trafficking of a2d subunits to the plasma membrane within nerve\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage appears in the “Pharmacology and Biochemistry” section (specifically under Mechanism of Action) of the gabapentin compound summary, where gabapentinoids’ binding to α2δ subunits of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels is described as the basis for their anti-allodynic effects in neuropathic pain models.\n                "}

Gabapentin enacarbil is a prodrug of gabapentin. Gabapentin is a white to off-white crystalline solid. Conventional (immediate-release) preparations of gabapentin are used in the management of seizure disorders and in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. Gabapentin enacarbil is commercially available as an extended-release tablet formulation for once-daily administration in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and primary restless legs syndrome. Gabapentin is also used in veterinary medicine in the treatment of seizures and as an analgesic for treating chronic pain in small animals.

One of the mechanisms implicated in this effect of gabapentin is the reduction of the axon excitability measured as an amplitude change of the presynaptic fibre volley (FV) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. This is mediated through its binding to presynaptic NMDA receptors. Other studies have shown that the antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects of gabapentin are mediated by the descending noradrenergic system, resulting in the activation of spinal alpha2-adrenergic receptors.

GAB was classified as not readily biodegradable. Moreover, photo treatment did not result in better biodegradable PTPs. With increasing UV treatment duration, photolytic mixtures of GAB showed an increased inhibition of both, the bacterial luminescence emission as well as the growth in the modified LBT. In the umu-test no significant induction of the umuC gene as an indicator of genotoxicity was observed. Our results show that UV irradiation of GAB containing water would lead to the formation of recalcitrant PTPs.
