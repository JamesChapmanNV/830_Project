All three amphetamines significantly elevated temperature; however the timecourse of effects differed. The acute effect of METH lasted hours longer than MDA or MDMA and a disruption of nighttime circadian cooling was observed as long as 18 hours after 1.0 mg/kg METH and 1.78-2.4 mg/kg MDA, but not after MDMA. Activity levels were only reliably increased by 0.32 mg/kg METH.
