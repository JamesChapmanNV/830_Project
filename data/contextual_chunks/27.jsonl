Used to control a variety of fungal diseases on rice including blast, ear blight and stem rot. Edifenphos is moderately toxic to mammals and fish but poses more of a risk to aquatic invertebrates. It has a role as a neurotoxin, an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, a phospholipid biosynthesis inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical.\n\nSee also: Polyethylene Glycol (annotation moved to).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk serves as the header and summary box of the Edifenphos compound page, providing key identifiers (PubChem CID, molecular formula, synonyms, molecular weight), core chemical safety classifications, and a concise description of its chemical nature, primary uses, and toxicological profile.

Apart from this no sex differences in absorption and excretion were noted. Tissue residues (35S-labelled) in both rats and mice were extremely low at 72 hours. Residues in tissues following acute or sub-acute (10-daily) doses were generally low and associated with tissues concerned with distribution and excretion.

Oxidation of organophosphorus insecticides may result in more or less toxic products. The glutathione transferase reactions produce products, that are, in most cases, of low toxicity.

Consideration of the concentration of metabolite(s) in the urine can be helpful in determining patterns of exposure, and these concentrations can be calibrated against the effects on AChE for a particular pesticide.

Levels of metabolite alone cannot be considered a guide to hazard. This is obvious when it is realized that pesticides that have very different toxicities may yield identical acidic metabolites. Thus, the level of metabolites in urine, after exposure to sufficient amounts of the very toxic parathion-methyl to depress blood-AChE to 50%, will be much lower than that of the identical metabolites, following exposure to the related fenitrothion, which is about 40 times less toxic. /Organophosphorus\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage appears in the section discussing medical surveillance and biological monitoring for occupational exposure to organophosphorus pesticides like edifenphos.
