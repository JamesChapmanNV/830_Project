A centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant, it is used as its hydrochloride salt in the symptomatic treatment of painful muscle spasm. It has a role as a muscle relaxant, a tranquilizing drug and an antidepressant. It derives from a hydride of a dibenzo[a,d][7]annulene.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is the summary box at the top of the Cyclobenzaprine compound page, providing quick reference information including identifiers (PubChem CID, synonyms, CAS number), molecular formula, structure images, chemical safety notations, molecular weight, key dates, and a concise chemical and pharmacological description.

Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.\n\nCyclobenzaprine is a Muscle Relaxant.

Currently there are no standardized drug therapies for the treatment of tinnitus. Based on the analogy between pain and tinnitus it is suggested that among all antidepressant families that have been used for tinnitus, particular interest should be paid to the tricyclic group of drugs as they have an analgesic effect. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a tricyclic pharmacological agent, namely cyclobenzaprine for the relief of tinnitus complaints. 65 patients, who received the drug treatment, were compared to 30 patients on a waiting list, who received no treatment. Analysis shows that cyclobenzaprine offers some benefit to patients with tinnitus on both tinnitus intensity and tinnitus distress, while a waiting list control group does not demonstrate any improvement: 24% of the tinnitus patients showed a clear response to cyclobenzaprine with a\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage appears in the \"Therapeutic Uses\" section of the Cyclobenzaprine compound page, presenting clinical findings on the off-label use of cyclobenzaprine, a tricyclic muscle relaxant, for treating tinnitus.

Despite its long half-life, it is relatively short-acting with a typical duration of action of 4-6 hours. Cyclobenzaprine has been reported to contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when used in combination with other serotonergic medications. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include autonomic instability, changes to mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities, or gastrointestinal symptoms - treatment with cyclobenzaprine should be discontinued immediately if any of these reactions occur during therapy.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nMuscle Relaxants, Central\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section falls within the Pharmacology and Biochemistry chapter of the cyclobenzaprine compound entry. It specifically introduces the pharmacodynamics of cyclobenzaprine, summarizing its mechanism of action as a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant, the typical duration of effect, and significant caution regarding serotonin syndrome. It is followed by official pharmacological classifications (e.g., MeSH) identifying cyclobenzaprine as a central muscle relaxant. This contextualization links clinical pharmacological effects and safety considerations within the comprehensive chemical and biomedical profile of cyclobenzaprine presented in the overall document.\n                "}

There is some evidence that cyclobenzaprine exerts its effects at the supraspinal level, specifically within the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, with little-to-no action at neuromuscular junctions or directly on skeletal musculature. Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity. More recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine’s observed effects.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Section 8.8 \"Mechanism of Action\" is part of the broader pharmacology and biochemistry section, following detailed discussions on cyclobenzaprine's pharmacodynamics, classification, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination.

Like other cyclical antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine antagonizes the muscarinic receptors, which may produce undesired side effects such as xerostomia, ileus, tachycardia, mydriasis, confusion, urinary retention, and hallucinations. Additionally, cyclobenzaprine antagonizes the alpha1 adrenergic receptor, causing a vasodilatory effect, and may contribute further to reflex tachycardia.
