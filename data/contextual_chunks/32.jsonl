Tasteless and odorless. A hallucinogen.\n\nLysergic acid diethylamide is an ergoline alkaloid arising from formal condensation of lysergic acid with diethylamine. It has a role as a hallucinogen, a serotonergic agonist and a dopamine agonist. It is an ergoline alkaloid, an organic heterotetracyclic compound and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It is functionally related to a lysergamide.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is the top “Compound Summary” panel from the PubChem record for Lysergide (CID 5761), showing its core identifiers (CID, molecular formula C20H25N3O, molecular weight 323.4 g/mol), safety classifications (acute toxic, health hazard), structure images, key synonyms (e.g. LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide), creation/last-modified dates, and a brief description of its physical form and pharmacological role as an ergoline alkaloid hallucinogen.\n                "}

Psychedelic psychotherapy typically involves a patient lying with their eyes-closed during peak drug effects, while listening to music and being supervised by trained psychotherapists. In this context, music is considered to be a key element in the therapeutic model; working in synergy with the drug to evoke therapeutically meaningful thoughts, emotions and imagery. The underlying mechanisms involved in this process have, however, never been formally investigated. Here we studied the interaction between LSD and music-listening on eyes-closed imagery by means of a placebo-controlled, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study.

Twelve healthy volunteers received intravenously administered LSD (75 ug) and, on a separate occasion, placebo, before being scanned under eyes-closed resting conditions with and without music-listening. The parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has previously been linked with (1) music-evoked emotion, (2) the action of psychedelics, and (3) mental imagery. Imaging analyses therefore focused on changes in the connectivity profile of this particular structure. Results revealed increased PHC-visual cortex (VC) functional connectivity and PHC to VC information flow in the interaction between music and LSD. This latter result correlated positively with ratings of enhanced eyes-closed visual imagery, including imagery of an autobiographical nature.

Organic amides/imides react with azo and diazo compounds to generate toxic gases. Flammable gases are formed by the reaction of organic amides/imides with strong reducing agents. Amides are very weak bases (weaker than water). Imides are less basic yet and in fact react with strong bases to form salts. That is, they can react as acids. Mixing amides with dehydrating agents such as P2O5 or SOCl2 generates the corresponding nitrile.

Within these classes drugs that are found on the street are discussed, and a current epidemiological summary is provided. The abuse liability and dependence potential of these drugs are evaluated by considering four major determinants of their abuse. First, is the ability of a drug to function as a positive reinforcer and increase the probability of operant behavior leading to its delivery. Animal data describing the reinforcing effects of PCP are reviewed with respect to the influence of variables controlling drug-reinforced behavior; however, there are no animal models of hallucinogen-reinforced behavior.

Several methods of quantifying reinforcing efficacy are discussed. A second determinant is the subjective effects of the respective drugs. These effects are described and compared across drugs based on clinical reports in humans and drug discrimination studies in animals. A third determinant is the behavioral and physiological toxicity that results from acute and chronic use of these drugs. Clinical reports and results of sensitive tests that have been developed for laboratory animals are reviewed. A fourth determinant is the dependence potential that exists with these drugs, measured by tolerance development and the extent to which behavioral and physiological disturbances occur when drug use is terminated.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from the “Special Reports” section (Carroll ME; PCP and Hallucinogens, Adv Alcohol Subst Abuse 9(1-2):167-90, 1990), summarizing the four major determinants of hallucinogen abuse liability—reinforcing efficacy, subjective effects, toxicity, and dependence potential—in a review of PCP and LSD.\n                "}

HUMAN STUDIES: LSD has significant cardiovascular effects owing to its sympathomimetic actions. Tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmias, shock, and respiratory arrest occur with severe overdose. Synesthesias and \"trails\" are characteristic of LSD. Synesthesias are a translation of one sensory modality into another, such as seeing colored vibrations of music, or smelling purple. Trails are formed positive afterimages that remain immediately behind an object as it moves across the subject's visual field. Adverse reactions to LSD are common.

QPCR was used to validate a subset of gene expression changes observed with RNA-Seq, and confirmed a significant correlation between the two methods. Functional clustering analysis indicates differentially expressed genes are enriched in pathways involving neurotransmission (Drd2, Gabrb1), synaptic plasticity (Nr2a, Krox20), energy metabolism (Atp5d, Ndufa1) and neuropeptide signaling (Npy, Bdnf), among others. Many processes identified as altered by chronic LSD are also implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and genes affected by LSD are enriched with putative schizophrenia genes.
