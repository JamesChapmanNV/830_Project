Tactile sensation is more powerful, erotic and noticeable on MDA. Physical effects are more up-front: gastric upset, pupil dilation, water retention, limbic arousal. On the whole, we find MDA a more enjoyable and interesting trip; longer lasting and more sexual/sensual. Our favorite characteristic is that one retains an interesting psychedelic ideation on MDA, rather then the feeling-oriented, but rather idealess thinking of MDM(A).\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage appears within Erowid's overview of MDA's effects, specifically in a section comparing MDA to MDMA, providing a user perspective (by Gracie & Zarkov) on how MDA's hallucinogenic, aesthetic, and physical effects differ from MDMA's, emphasizing MDA's stronger sensory, psychedelic, and body-related experiences.\n                "}
