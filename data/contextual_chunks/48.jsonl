It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action. Due to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.

Like many basic drugs, methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non-immunological mechanism leading to flushing, pruritus, and urticaria, which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction. Compared to other opioids, methadone has fewer active metabolites and therefore a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity. This means that higher doses needed to manage severe pain or addiction are less likely to result in delirium, hyperalgesia, or seizures. Similar to morphine, both methadone isomers are 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, although l-methadone produces greater inhibition than d-methadone.

The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for analgesia and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe. Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone's efficacy is unknown.

NAS symptoms can include irritability, crying, sneezing, stuffy nose, poor sleep, extreme drowsiness (tired), yawning, poor feeding, sweating, tremors, seizures, vomiting, and diarrhea. Not all babies will develop NAS. Symptoms of NAS may appear after birth and may last more than two weeks. If needed, babies can be treated for withdrawal while in the hospital.

Although most cases involve patients receiving high, multiple daily doses of methadone for pain management, instances have also been reported in patients receiving standard doses for opioid addiction maintenance treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to closely monitor patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval, a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, or medications that impact cardiac conduction. In addition, regular monitoring for changes in cardiac rhythm should be implemented during the initiation and titration of methadone injection.\n\nRegulations for the distribution and use of methadone for OUD: To address opioid dependence through maintenance and detoxification, methadone administration must adhere to both federal and state laws.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    From the Safety and Hazards chapter’s “Boxed Warnings” and regulatory subsections, this passage alerts clinicians to methadone injection’s risk of life-threatening QT interval prolongation/Torsades de pointes—especially at high or standard maintenance doses—and mandates ECG monitoring during dose initiation and titration, then outlines the federal and state legal framework for methadone dispensing in opioid dependence treatment.\n                "}
