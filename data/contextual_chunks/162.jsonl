Unless there is a particular reason to be looking for it, as in the case of an autopsy...it is extremely unlikely that most people will ever run into this test. It is not one of the SAMHSA-5 standardly tested for in the basic drug test, nor is it included in the extended drug tests. It is not chemically similar to any of the drugs tested for, so should not trigger the tests as another substance. An LSD metabolite created by the body called 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD has a somewhat longer half-life than LSD itself and is one of the main metabolites used to test for LSD use. Although most LSD-specific tests only test positive for less than two days, the metabolite tests for 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD are effective for 3-4 days after LSD ingestion.\n\nMilitary\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the methods and challenges of testing for LSD—particularly in urine—including the rarity and expense of such tests, the metabolites targeted for detection, and notes on LSD drug testing policies in the military.

Reportedly this was because only four positive LSD tests were found out of more than 2 million test conducted over a three year period. This cost-benefit analysis resulted in the military ceasing LSD testing as part of their standard panel. As recently as November 2012, however, we have had reports of occasional Army tests including LSD.
