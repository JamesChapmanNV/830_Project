The NBOMe chemicals can cause strong effects even on a single standard hit of blotter (1/4\" (6mm) square). Unlike LSD, NBOMes can cause death. NBOMe compounds are usually bitter while LSD-containing liquid or blotter has only a mild metallic flavor or no flavor at all.\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION #\n\nLSD FAQ\n\nLSD FAQ #2\n\nLSD Facts\n\nLSD & Color Blindness\n\nLSD Purity Discussion\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides an overview of LSD-25, detailing its common names, classification as a psychedelic, chemical name, primary description, and key safety information about NBOMe adulterants.
