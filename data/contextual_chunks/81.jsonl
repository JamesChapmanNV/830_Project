Studies have shown[32][33] that the effect of the drug is immediate or within 2 hours and consistent in relieving a patient’s depressive and/or suicidal symptoms, lasting up to 3 days after a single dose. In comparison, common antidepressants such as fluoxetine (Prozac) can take weeks to show therapeutic effects.\n\nKetamine is a racemate composed of the R-(−)-ketamine enantiomer (arketamine) and the S-(+)-ketamine enantiomer (esketamine). Esketamine inhibits the reuptake of the dopamine transporter about 8-fold more potently than does arketamine, and so is about 8 times more potent as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.[34] Arketamine appears to be more effective as a rapid-acting antidepressant than esketamine.[35]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears under \"Research\" and discusses ketamine's use as a novel rapid-acting antidepressant, describing clinical findings in depression and bipolar disorder, its comparative onset versus traditional antidepressants, and the pharmacological distinctions between its enantiomers, esketamine and arketamine.
