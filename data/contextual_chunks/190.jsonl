It is legally prescribed as a treatment for ADD under the brand name Desoxyn, for both children and adults. On the street, it is generally found as an odorless, white or off-white, bitter-tasting powder, though it is also found in pills, capsules and larger crystals. It is frequently snorted, but is also used orally, smoked, and injected. Methamphetamine production is a relatively simple process, especially when compared to many other recreational drugs. It is frequently reported on in the media when home meth-producing labs are busted.\n\n[ Main Meth Vault ]\n\nDose #\n\nDose Summary Needed.\n\nPrice #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is the beginning of Erowid’s Methamphetamine Basics page, providing an overview and description of methamphetamine, its legal prescription use, appearance, routes of administration, basic production information, and mention of street reporting, followed by section headings for dosage and price.

The HCl salt is smokable as is. Crystal meth \"Crystal Meth\" or \"Ice\" refer to methamphetamine grown into crystals. Though many people believe that Crystal Meth is the freebase form of methamphetamie HCl, this is not true. Methamphetamine is smokable in its normal HCL form, but taking the time to grow it into crystals makes it easier to smoke.

Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). MAOIs and Methamphetamine are a potentially dangerous combination.
