It is an alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist and frequently used in veterinary medicine as an emetic and sedative with analgesic and muscle relaxant properties. It has a role as an emetic, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a sedative, a muscle relaxant and an analgesic. It is a methylbenzene, a 1,3-thiazine and a secondary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a xylazine(1+).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk serves as the prominent summary box at the top of the Xylazine PubChem compound page, providing essential chemical identifiers, structural images, fundamental physical properties, key synonyms, and a brief pharmacological description.

It acts as an agonist at α2 adrenoceptors; however, its affinity is lower than the one reported for other α2 adrenergic receptor agonists such as [detomidine] and [medetomidine]. Xylazine is not approved for human use and requires a veterinary licence for its purchase and use. The intentional and unintentional use of xylazine is a cause for concern due to its side effects. The use of xylazine can lead to hypotension and bradycardia, and when combined with central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, it can significantly depress vital functions and increase the risk of overdose and death. Xylazine is sometimes used as an adulterant and combined with opioids and recreational drugs; however, it has no antidote, and the use of [naloxone] has no effect on xylazine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage is from the overview section detailing xylazine’s pharmacological profile, veterinary uses, receptor activity, regulatory status, clinical concerns, risks when combined with other CNS depressants, and relevance in drug adulteration, emphasizing its dangers and absence of an effective antidote.\n                "}
