Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at Rα. MDA also contains substitutions at R3 and R4 of the phenyl ring with oxygen groups. These oxygen groups are incorporated into a methylenedioxy ring through a methylene chain. MDA shares this methylenedioxy ring with MDMA, MDAI and more obscure variants like MDEA or MMDA.\n\nPharmacology\n\nFurther information: Serotonergic psychedelic\n\nMDA acts as a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of the neurotransmitters known as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.[10][11] It also functions as a 5-HT2A,[12] 5-HT2B,[13] and 5-HT2C[14] receptor agonist and shows affinity for the TAAR1, α2A-, α2B-, α2C-adrenergic receptors and 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors.[15]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on the chemistry and pharmacology of MDA, following its historical background and preceding the exploration of its subjective effects.

However, MDA has a higher efficacy in stimulating the 5-HT2A receptor than MDMA; thus MDA tends to cause more psychedelic-like effects, such as visual geometry and hallucinations. While MDMA can also produce psychedelic-like visual effects, these are less pronounced than those of MDA or require a heavier dose to become apparent. It is worth noting that the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.\n\nSubjective effects\n\nWhile MDA is similar to MDMA, users report that MDA has more stimulant and psychedelic qualities and less intense entactogenic effects than MDMA. MDA is also considered to be less predictable than MDMA, with effects varying greatly from person to person.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk discusses and compares the mechanisms and subjective effects of MDA and MDMA, specifically focusing on MDA’s higher 5-HT2A receptor activity leading to stronger psychedelic visual effects. It transitions from pharmacology into a subjective effects overview, highlighting how MDA’s effects differ from MDMA in terms of stimulation, psychedelia, and unpredictability, setting the stage for the detailed descriptions of MDA’s physical, visual, and cognitive effects that follow.\n                "}
