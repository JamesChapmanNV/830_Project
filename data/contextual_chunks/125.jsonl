Certainty: unknown, little direct evidence, some evidence, case reports only, medium / link established, high / clear causation.\n\nHealth risks and problems associated with amphetamine use:\n\nAgitation, Inability to Concentrate: In some users, increasing with dose, amphetamine causes agitation, restlessness, and inability to concentrate or focus.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section introduces the health risks and issues associated with amphetamine and methamphetamine use, as part of Erowid's detailed overview of amphetamines in the broader Chemicals index.

High-dose use can result in rhabdomyolysis, causing large amounts of proteins to be released into the blood. Urine becomes dark as the rhabdomyolysis increases and the kidneys can suffer mild to severe damage. [Chan 1994, Lan 1998].\n\nFrequency: rare.\n\nCertainty: some direct evidence.\n\nDangerous to combine with other stimulants: Amphetamines used with MDMA appear to cause damage to the dopamine neurons in the brain [Reneman 2002].
