When temazepam binds to the GABAA receptor, it causes the Cl- ion pore to open more frequently. The anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors.[9]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears after the chemistry description of temazepam, summarizing its physical properties and introducing its pharmacology.
