A mu-opioid receptor antagonist, it is used to treat alcohol dependence. It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, a central nervous system depressant, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an antidote to opioid poisoning. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a morphinane-like compound and a member of cyclopropanes. It is a conjugate base of a naltrexone(1+).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from the top‐level “Names and Identifiers” and “Description” sections of the PubChem Naltrexone compound page, listing its synonyms (e.g., ReVia, Vivitrol), molecular weight (341.4 g/mol), database creation/modification dates, and a concise chemical description (a cyclopropylmethyl-substituted naloxone analogue and μ-opioid receptor antagonist used to treat alcohol dependence).\n                "}

Naltrexone is indicated in the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the blockade of the effects of exogenously administered opioids. It markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of intravenously administered opioids. When co-administered with morphine, on a chronic basis, naltrexone blocks the physical dependence to morphine, heroin and other opioids. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, naltrexone will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAlcohol Deterrents\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from the PubChem Compound Summary for Naltrexone, specifically Section 8 (“Pharmacology and Biochemistry”).

The mechanism of action of naltrexone in alcoholism is not understood; however, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone is thought to act as a competitive antagonist at mc, κ, and δ receptors in the CNS, with the highest affintiy for the μ receptor. Naltrexone competitively binds to such receptors and may block the effects of endogenous opioids. This leads to the antagonization of most of the subjective and objective effects of opiates, including respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, and drug craving. The major metabolite of naltrexone, 6-β-naltrexol, is also an opiate antagonist and may contribute to the antagonistic activity of the drug.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Section 8.8 (“Mechanism of Action”) – this passage, citing Li H et al. (1996; PMID:9208648), explains that naltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist acting competitively at μ (highest affinity), κ, and δ receptors in the CNS, blocking endogenous opioids and most opiate effects, with its active metabolite 6-β-naltrexol also contributing to this antagonism.\n                "}

Liquid-liquid extraction with butyl acetate from basic solutions (pH 9) was chosen for extraction with nalorphine as an internal standard (IS). Analytes were back-extracted from organic solvent into perchloric acid. The acid extract was chromatographed by HPLC with a reverse-phase ODS-column and electrochemical detector. The mobile phase was a NaH(2)PO(4)-solution with acetonitrile as an organic modifier and octanesulfonic acid and tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulfate as ion-pair reagents. The recovery of the extraction method was 48% for naltrexone and 75% for 6-beta-naltrexol. The limit of quantification was 5.0 ng/mL for naltrexone and 1.0 ng/mL for 6-beta-naltrexol.

The mechanism of action of naltrexone in alcohol dependence is not known. Patients receiving 800 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride daily for up to 1 week in one study showed no evidence of toxicity. However, lower dosages reportedly have been hepatotoxic in some patients. No serious adverse effects were observed following administration of single naltrexone doses of up to 784 mg (as the extended-release im injection) in several healthy individuals.

The mechanism of action of naltrexone in alcoholism is not understood; however, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone is thought to act as a competitive antagonist at mc, kappa, and delta receptors in the CNS, with the highest affintiy for the mu receptor. Naltrexone competitively binds to such receptors and may block the effects of endogenous opioids. This leads to the antagonization of most of the subjective and objective effects of opiates, including respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, and drug craving.

The present pilot study tested the hypothesis that acute pretreatment with the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam would not produce clinically problematic physiological effects or negative subjective effects and would reduce the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine to a greater extent than the constituent drugs alone. Eight nontreatment-seeking, stimulant-using individuals completed an outpatient experiment in which oral d-amphetamine (0, 15, and 30 mg) was administered following acute pretreatment with naltrexone (0 and 50 mg) and alprazolam (0 and 0.5 mg).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpted from the PubChem entry’s Drug–Drug Interactions section on naltrexone, this pilot outpatient study in non-treatment-seeking stimulant users evaluated whether acute pretreatment with naltrexone (50 mg) plus alprazolam (0.5 mg) would safely enhance attenuation of the positive subjective effects of oral d-amphetamine (0, 15, and 30 mg) compared to either drug alone.\n                "}
