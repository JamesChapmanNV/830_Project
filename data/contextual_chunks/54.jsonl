It is a moderately potent opioid analgesic, generally used for relief of moderate to severe pain. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and an antitussive. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a semisynthetic derivative. It is functionally related to a thebaine. It is a conjugate base of an oxycodone(1+). It derives from a hydride of a morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Top‐of‐page PubChem compound summary for Oxycodone: provides the CID (5284603), 2D/3D structure images, safety classifications (irritant, health hazard with LCSS reference), core identifiers (molecular formula C18H21NO4, molecular weight 315.4 g/mol), key synonyms (e.g., dihydrohydroxycodeinone), record creation/modification dates, and a concise description framing oxycodone as a semisynthetic, heteropentacyclic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine, acting as a mu‐opioid receptor agonist and antitussive.\n                "}

These tissues include the respiratory centre in the brain stem, the cough centre in the medulla, muscles of the pupils, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and immune system. Oxycodone's effect on the respiratory centre is dose dependant respiratory depression. The action on the cough centre is suppression of the cough reflex. Pupils become miopic or decrease in size, peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract slows, and muscle tone in the colon may increase causing constipation. In the cardiovascular system histamine may be released leading to pruritis, red eyes, flushing, sweating, and decreased blood pressure. Endocrine effects may include increased prolactin, decreased cortisol, and decreased testosterone. It is not yet known if the effects of opioids on the immune system are clinically significant.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is from Section 8 (“Pharmacology and Biochemistry”) of the oxycodone compound page, specifically subsection 8.1 (“Pharmacodynamics”), which describes how oxycodone exerts its opioid effects across multiple tissues—CNS (respiratory depression, cough suppression), pupils (miosis), gastrointestinal (reduced motility, constipation), cardiovascular (histamine-mediated vasodilation, hypotension), endocrine (prolactin ↑, cortisol and testosterone ↓), and potential immune system impacts.\n                "}

Under conditions of inflammation or hyperalgesia, opioid receptors in the heart, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive system are upregulated and transported to nerve terminals. Oxycodone and its active metabolites, noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone are opioid agonists. These compounds passively diffuse across the blood brain barrier or may be actively transported across by an unknown mechanism. Oxycodone and its active metabolites can selectively bind to the mu opioid receptor, but also the kappa and delta opioid receptors in the central nervous system and periphery, and induce a G protein coupled receptor signalling pathway. Activation of mu opioid receptors inhibits N-type voltage operated calcium channels, inhibiting responses to pain.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from section 8.8 (“Mechanism of Action”) of the Pharmacology and Biochemistry portion of the oxycodone compound page—immediately following the summary of biological half-life data—where it explains how oxycodone and its active metabolites act as mu-, kappa- and delta-opioid receptor agonists, engage G-protein coupled signalling, and inhibit N-type voltage-gated calcium channels to produce analgesia.\n                "}

Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.

It is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. HUMAN STUDIES: Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Acute overdose can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations. Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy.

In 2014, the FDA warned against the use of opioid combinations in which the dose of acetaminophen is greater than 325 mg per tablet or unit dose.

Sedation in breastfed infants has occurred after maternal use of oxycodone. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics.

Extended-release oxycodone products (such as OxyContin) are not recommended in nursing mothers. If oxycodone is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral oxycodone (and combinations) to a 2 to 3 days, especially in the outpatient setting.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the Toxicological Information section (Section 12) of the comprehensive oxycodone compound record, specifically under “12.1.7 Effects During Pregnancy and Lactation,” where it summarizes guidance and observed risks of infant sedation and central nervous system depression when mothers use oral oxycodone while breastfeeding.\n                "}

NAS symptoms can include irritability, crying, sneezing, stuffy nose, poor sleep, extreme drowsiness (very tired), yawning, poor feeding, sweating, tremors, seizures, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most often, symptoms of NAS appear 2 days after birth and may last more than 2 weeks. The chance that NAS will occur depends on the length of time and/or the dose of opioid taken during pregnancy, if other medications were also taken, if the baby was born preterm, and/or the size of the baby at birth.

Overdose deaths are largely assumed to be the result of excessive opioid consumption. In many of these cases, however, opioid abusers are often polydrug abusers. Benzodiazepines are one of the most commonly co-abused substances and pose a significant risk to opioid users. In 2016, the FDA required boxed warnings - the FDA's strongest warning - for prescription opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines about the serious risks associated with using these medications at the same time. The point of our studies was to evaluate the interactions between these two classes of drugs. We investigated whether diazepam adds to the depressant effects of opioids or do they alter the levels of tolerance to opioids. In the present study, we have found that the antinociceptive tolerance that developed to repeated administration of oxycodone was reversed by an acute dose of diazepam. Antinociceptive tolerance to hydrocodone was\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from the “Drug–Drug Interactions” section of the oxycodone profile, summarizing preclinical research on opioid–benzodiazepine co-use.

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that oxycodone is expected to have high mobility in soil. The pKa of oxycodone is 8.53(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4).\n\n(1) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.

The Henry's Law constant for oxycodone is estimated as 2.3X10-16 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) using a fragment constant estimation method(2). This Henry's Law constant indicates that neutral oxycodone is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water and moist soil surfaces(3). Oxycodone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.3X10-10 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from the Oxycodone PubChem Compound Summary (section 12.2.8 “Volatilization from Water / Soil”), describing how oxycodone’s pKa (8.53), estimated Henry’s Law constant (2.3×10⁻¹⁶ atm·m³/mol) and vapor pressure (2.3×10⁻¹⁰ mm Hg)—calculated via fragment‐constant methods—indicate negligible volatilization from water or soil (Refs: Swann et al. 1983; Merck Index 2013; Doucette 2000).\n                "}
