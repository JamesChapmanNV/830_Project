Chemical analysis of ecstasy tablets has found from 0 - 120 mg of MDMA as well as a variety of the above substances. Trying to calculate dosages from tablets containing unknown quantities of MDMA can be difficult, but a high quality tablet of street ecstasy (those containing MDMA alone) generally contains between 80 and 120 mg of MDMA. Some unusual tablets (especially in Europe) contain 150mg or more. The chart below shows what are considered recreational/therapeutic dosages for pure MDMA HCl (the most common crystalline form), measured in milligrams.
