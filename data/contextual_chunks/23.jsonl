These safety risks are potentially harmful interactions with numerous other medications, problems with the adrenal glands, and decreased sex hormone levels. We are requiring changes to the labels of all opioid drugs to warn about these risks. Opioids can interact with antidepressants and migraine medicines to cause a serious central nervous system reaction called serotonin syndrome, in which high levels of the chemical serotonin build up in the brain and cause toxicity. Taking opioids may lead to a rare, but serious condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol helps the body respond to stress. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as reduced interest in sex, impotence, or infertility.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the PubChem Codeine record under “7 Drug and Medication Information,” specifically in subsection 7.12 “Drug Warnings,” where FDA–mandated class-wide opioid safety alerts are summarized (drug–drug interactions, adrenal insufficiency, and reduced sex hormone levels).\n                "}

Human scalp hair grows approximately 1cm per month and can therefore reflect a retrospective timeline of drug exposure.

Thirty-two healthy women (ages 21-51 years) with a known history of heroin abuse, who went to a rehabilitation center and ceased consuming heroin (for 4-5 months), were recruited into the study.

It commonly is given in combination with aspirin, acetaminophen, or other agents. It may also be used in veterinary care as an analgesic and antitussive. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Toxic doses of codeine may produce exhilaration, excitement, seizures, delirium, hypotension, miosis, slow pulse, tachycardia, narcosis, flushed facies, tinnitus, lassitude, muscular weakness, and circulatory collapse or respiratory paralysis. Cardiovascular side effects, ataxia, and headache have been observed in cases of accidental exposure. Respiratory arrest, coma, and death have occurred in young children receiving oral codeine doses of 5-12 mg/kg. Codeine should not be prescribed to children due to its poor analgesic effect and risk of opioid toxicity and oversedation.

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Codeine's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine.

A few studies looking at codeine use in pregnancy suggest a possible small increased chance of some birth defects, such as spina bifida (when the fetal spinal cord does not develop as usual) as well as problems with the intestines and/or heart problems. However, studies have not found a specific pattern of birth defects caused by codeine or opioid use in general. If there is an increased chance of birth defects with codeine use in pregnancy, it is likely to be small.\n\n◈ Does taking codeine in pregnancy increase the chance of other pregnancy-related problems?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Context: This excerpt comes from the “Effects During Pregnancy and Lactation” section of the Codeine safety/toxicity summary (e.g., MotherToBaby FAQ), under the sub-heading “Does taking codeine increase the chance of birth defects?” where background birth-defect risk and evidence from epidemiological studies are summarized.\n                "}

This is more commonly reported in people who take opioids in higher doses or for longer than recommended by their healthcare providers (i.e., misuse or “abuse” opioids).

NAS symptoms with opioids can include trouble breathing, extreme drowsiness (sleepiness), poor feeding, irritability, sweating, tremors, vomiting and diarrhea. Most often, symptoms of NAS appear two days after birth and may last more than two weeks. The chance that NAS will occur depends on the length of time and/or the dose of opioid taken during pregnancy. If opioids were taken in pregnancy, it is important to let your baby’s healthcare providers know so that they can check for symptoms of NAS and provide the best care for your newborn.\n\n◈ Does taking codeine in pregnancy affect future behavior or learning for the child?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpted from the Codeine “Effects During Pregnancy and Lactation” section (MotherToBaby Fact Sheet) in the full Codeine compound profile, this passage explains the risk of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome in newborns exposed in utero and addresses potential longer-term effects on child behavior and learning.\n                "}

Codeine is a widely used opioid, which is metabolized to morphine to elicit analgesia. Prolonged morphine exposure exacerbates pain by activating the innate immune toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the central nervous system. In silico docking simulations indicate codeine also docks to MD2, an accessory protein for TLR4, suggesting potential to induce TLR4-dependent pain facilitation. We hypothesized codeine would cause TLR4-dependent hyperalgesia/allodynia that is disparate from its opioid receptor-dependent analgesic rank potency. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were assessed using hotplate and von Frey tests at days 0, 3 and 5 in mice receiving intraperitoneal equimolar codeine (21 mg kg(-1)), morphine (20 mg kg(-1)) or saline, twice daily. This experiment was repeated in animals with prior partial nerve injury and in TLR4 null mutant mice.

Analyses of glial activation markers (glial fibrillary acid protein and CD11b) in neuronal tissue were conducted at the completion of behavioral testing. Despite providing less acute analgesia (P=0.006), codeine induced similar hotplate hyperalgesia to equimolar morphine vs saline (-9.5 s, P<0.01 and -7.3 s, P<0.01, respectively), suggesting codeine does not rely upon conversion to morphine to increase pain sensitivity.

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that codeine is expected to have low mobility in soil. The pKa of codeine is 8.21(3), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Sorption isotherms of 2.1 and 14.1 for codeine, present at 50 ng/mL, were measured using river sediments at pH 6.5-6.6 from the Burgen and Dausenau rivers, respectively, Switzerland. The log Koc values of 2.4 and 2.5 correspond to Koc values of 251 and 315, respectively(5).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the Environmental Fate section (13.2), under Soil Adsorption/Mobility (13.2.7), where codeine’s estimated Koc of 700 (via molecular connectivity indices) and measured sediment sorption (log Koc 2.4–2.5 in Swiss river sediments at pH 6.5–6.6) illustrate its low soil mobility as a predominantly cationic species (pKa 8.21).\n                "}
