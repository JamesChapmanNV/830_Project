Depending on dose and lighting, they can be described as slow or fast in speed, static in permanence, smooth in motion, realistic in appearance, and simplistic or intricate.\n\nExternal hallucinations - At very high doses, zopiclone can produce external hallucinations that are similar to, but less pronounced than those of deliriants.\n\nTracers - This effect is mild and typically only experienced at high doses.\n\nCognitive effects\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears within the \"Subjective effects\" section of the Zopiclone drug profile and specifically details the sensory and perceptual changes experienced by users, such as metallic taste, visual phenomena (shadow people, drifting, external hallucinations, tracers), and leads into cognitive effects.

The general head space of zopiclone is described by many as one of intense sedation, decreased inhibition and severe amnesia. It produces a large number of cognitive effects typical of most GABA-ergic depressants.\n\nAmnesia - Compared to benzodiazepines, zopiclone can produce amnesia at much lower doses.

If zopiclone has been taken for more than a few weeks, then the medication should be gradually reduced or preferably crossed over to an equivalent dose of diazepam (Valium) which has a much longer half-life, making withdrawal easier. One should then gradually taper the dose over a period of several months to avoid extremely severe and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms which can last up to two years after withdrawal if the withdrawal is done too abruptly. http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/\n\n↑ https://ccsa.ca/sites/default/files/2019-04/CCSA-Canadian-Drug-Summary-Prescription-Sedatives-2017-en.pdf\n\n↑ AMVV - Verordnung über die Verschreibungspflicht von Arzneimitteln\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is part of the \"References\" section at the end of the Zopiclone page, providing citations for statements made in the document, including information on withdrawal management, Canadian drug regulations, and German prescription laws.\n                "}
