Vapor-phase 2,6-xylidine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.4 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.6X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 °C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 2,6-Xylidine absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).\n\n(1) Bidleman TF; Environ Sci Technol 22: 361-367 (1988)\n\n(2) Chao J et al; J Phys Chem Ref Data 12: 1033-63 (1983)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from the Ecological Information section (11.2), within the Environmental Fate summary, specifically the “Atmospheric Fate” subsection, where the vapor‐phase behavior, hydroxyl‐radical degradation rate (half‐life ~2.4 h), and photolysis susceptibility of 2,6-xylidine in air are described.\n                "}
