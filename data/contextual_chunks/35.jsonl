It has a role as a neurotoxin, a psychotropic drug, a central nervous system stimulant, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of amphetamines and a secondary amine. It is functionally related to a (S)-amphetamine. It is a conjugate base of a methamphetamine(1+).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is the top‐of‐page compound summary from the PubChem entry for Methamphetamine (CID 10836), listing its key identifiers (CID, formula C10H15N, molecular weight 149.23 g/mol), safety classification (Acute Toxic), structure images, synonyms, creation/modification dates, and a concise description of its chemical class and biological roles.\n                "}

The acute effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an epinephrine-provoked fight-or-flight response, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, vasoconstriction (constriction of the arterial walls), bronchodilation, and hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar). Users experience an increase in focus, increased mental alertness, and the elimination of fatigue, as well as a decrease in appetite.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAdrenergic Uptake Inhibitors\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the PubChem Methamphetamine entry’s Section 8 (“Pharmacology and Biochemistry”), immediately following the toxicology reference (Gossel & Bricker, p. 421) and introducing subsection 8.1 (“Pharmacodynamics”), before the MeSH pharmacological classification in 8.2.\n                "}

It may also slow down catecholamine metabolism by inhibiting monoamine oxidase. The toxic effects of methamphetamine on dopamine and serotonergic neurons have recently been linked to the endogenous formation of c-hydroxy dopamine and 5, 7 dihydrotryptamine, respectively. The ability of methamphetamine to both release dopamine and serotonin as well as to inhibit monoamine oxidase activity leads to the non-enzymatic oxidation of dopamine and serotonin. Methamphetamine induced neuronal damage is mediated by the production of free radicals. This drug causes a long lasting depletion of dopamine and serotonin in the striatum and that pre-treatment alteration of this effect by four different antioxidants, as well as an inhibitor of superoxidase dismutase, indicate that oxygen free radicals have a role in methamphetamine\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from Section 8.8 “Mechanism of Action” in the Pharmacology and Biochemistry section, describing how methamphetamine releases norepinephrine and dopamine, inhibits monoamine oxidase, and induces free-radical–mediated oxidative damage to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons.\n                "}

In each WWTP, samples were taken daily for seven consecutive days in July 2014. RESULTS: We observed differences of amphetamine versus methamphetamine loads (expressed as mg/day/1000 inhabitants): Amphetamine loads were much higher in all tested WWTPs indicating a low prevalence of methamphetamine abuse in the federal state of Saarland at the tested period. These findings are in line with previous reports about the distribution of amphetamine and methamphetamine in Germany and Europe. CONCLUSIONS: The approach confirms that wastewater analysis can provide valuable data about the abuse pattern of drugs of abuse in cities and larger areas. It can be useful for planning interventions aimed at specific areas and substances.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from section “10.1 Analytic Laboratory Methods – Wastewater‐Based Epidemiology”: daily 24 h composite samples were collected over seven days in July 2014 at ten Saarland WWTPs serving cities (> 200 000; > 50 000; > 25 000 inhabitants) and villages (< 25 000). Analysis of amphetamine and methamphetamine loads (mg/day/1000 inhabitants) showed consistently higher amphetamine levels and low methamphetamine prevalence, mirroring regional drug‐use patterns and demonstrating wastewater analysis as a tool for mapping stimulant abuse trends.\n                "}

Subsection 12.2.6 (“Environmental Bioconcentration”) reports an estimated fish bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 11—calculated from a log Kow of 2.07 via a regression model—indicating low potential for aquatic bioconcentration. Subsection 12.2.7 (“Soil Adsorption / Mobility”) uses a molecular‐connectivity approach to estimate a soil organic-carbon partition coefficient (Koc) of 900, classifying d-methamphetamine as having low soil mobility; its pKa of 9.87 implies it exists predominantly as a cation, enhancing adsorption to organic- and clay-rich soils.\n                "}
