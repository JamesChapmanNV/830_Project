This phenyl ring is substituted at R3 with a hydroxy group (OH-). An additional hydroxy group is found at the same location the cyclohexane ring is bonded to at the phenyl ring, R1. O-DMST features a third substitution on its cyclohexane ring at R2.

When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage appears in the \"Toxicity and harm potential\" section of the O-Desmethyltramadol article, following a description of its general toxicity risks.

The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). O-DSMT presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of O-DSMT all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nWarning: Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances.
