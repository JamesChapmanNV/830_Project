Binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. It has a role as an anticonvulsant and a calcium channel blocker. It is functionally related to a gamma-aminobutyric acid.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears at the top of the PubChem compound page for pregabalin, providing a concise summary with core chemical identifiers, structural depictions, basic safety information, synonyms, molecular formula and weight, and a brief functional description. It serves as an overview preceding more detailed sections on properties, uses, pharmacology, toxicology, and regulatory information presented in later parts of the document.\n                "}

Substances in the DEA Schedule V have a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule IV and consist primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. It is a Depressants substance.\n\nPregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions. Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively characterized, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release). It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in the descriptive summary at the top of the Pregabalin compound page, providing a high-level overview of its legal status as a Schedule V controlled substance, its structural similarity to GABA, therapeutic uses (neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, postherpetic neuralgia), mechanism of action, main marketed names (Lyrica), and the potential for dependence—highlighting essential background before the document’s in-depth sections on properties, safety, pharmacology, regulatory details, and clinical information.\n                "}

Pregabalin oral bioavailability is reported to be ≥90% regardless of the dose. Cmax is attained within 1.5 hours after single or multiple doses, and steady state is attained within 24-48 hours with repeated administration. Both Cmax and AUC appear to be dose proportional. Food decreases the rate of pregabalin absorption and as a result, lowers the Cmax by an estimated 25-30% and increases the Tmax to approximately 3 hours. However, the effect of food does not appear to impact the total absorption of pregabalin in a way that is clinically relevant. As a result, pregabalin can be administered with or without food.\n\nRoute of Elimination\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the pharmacokinetics of pregabalin, specifically its absorption characteristics after oral administration, effects of food, and overall oral bioavailability, as part of the broader Pharmacology and Biochemistry subsection covering Absorption, Distribution, and Excretion within the comprehensive drug information page.

Although pregabalin is not very lipophilic, it is able to cross the blood brain barrier(BBB). System L transporters facilitate the transport of large amino acids across the BBB and it has been confirmed that pregabalin is a substrate.

In prelicensure clinical trials in diabetic neuropathy and epilepsy, therapy with pregabalin was not associated with an increased frequency of serum aminotransferase elevations or liver toxicity. Since its approval and more wide scale use, however, pregabalin has been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury. Most cases were mild and frequently without jaundice. The latency to onset of injury was short, symptoms of liver injury arising within 3 to 14 days. Both cholestatic and hepatocellular patterns of injury have been reported. Signs of hypersensitivity (fever, rash, eosinophilia) and autoimmunity were not present. Some cases have been severe and associated with marked jaundice and prolongation of the prothrombin time, but all cases ultimately resolved after the medication was stopped without evidence of residual injury.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides information on the potential for pregabalin to cause liver injury (hepatotoxicity).

Pharmacokinetic model predicted that a maternal dosage of 150 mg daily would not result in a therapeutic level in an exclusively breastfed infant of any age. If pregabalin is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but until more data become available, use caution while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. The manufacturer recommends that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity based on high-dose animal studies over a prolonged period. Pregabalin has been used to treat persistent nipple pain in a few women at an average starting dosage of 100 mg daily.\n\n◉ Effects in Breastfed Infants\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides information on the effects of pregabalin use during pregnancy and lactation, including safety considerations, levels detected in breast milk, infant outcomes, and manufacturer recommendations, as part of the broader document's detailed review of pregabalin's toxicity, adverse effects, and risk profiles in special populations.\n                "}
