A semi-synthetic drug, it is a centrally acting pain medication of the opioid class. It has a role as an opioid analgesic and a mu-opioid receptor agonist.

Structurally, hydromorphone derived from [morphine] in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound. Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential). The first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nHydromorphone Hydrochloride (has salt form).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\nHydromorphone.png\n\n1.2 3D Conformer\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the “Description” section of the Hydromorphone compound page, summarizing its structural derivation from morphine, classification as a semi-synthetic Schedule II opioid with high potency and comparable side effects, and noting the first FDA approval of hydromorphone hydrochloride in 1984.\n                "}

Due to its addictive potential and overdose risk, hydromorphone is only prescribed when other first-line treatments have failed. The WHO has proposed a three-step ladder for the management of pain in which it is suggested to start with a non-opioid medication followed by addition of weak opioids to the non-opioid treatment for moderate pain and finishing in the use of strong opioids such as hydromorphone along with the existing regimen for cases of severe pain.

These safety risks are potentially harmful interactions with numerous other medications, problems with the adrenal glands, and decreased sex hormone levels. We are requiring changes to the labels of all opioid drugs to warn about these risks. Opioids can interact with antidepressants and migraine medicines to cause a serious central nervous system reaction called serotonin syndrome, in which high levels of the chemical serotonin build up in the brain and cause toxicity. Taking opioids may lead to a rare, but serious condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol helps the body respond to stress. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as reduced interest in sex, impotence, or infertility.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is from section 7.8 “Drug Warnings” of the “Drug and Medication Information” chapter in the comprehensive PubChem summary for hydromorphone, where FDA class-wide safety communications for opioid analgesics are detailed (interactions, adrenal and hormonal risks).\n                "}

Its analgesic effect is suggested to be related to the effect on the mu-opioid receptors. It has been reported to also have a minor affinity for the delta and kappa receptor. On the other hand, it is known to act at the level of the medulla which allows it to depress the respiratory drive and suppress cough. The onset of action of the immediate release form of hydromorphone is achieved in 15-20 minutes and having a lasting effect for 3-4 hours while the extended-release form onset of action is of 6 hours lasting for about 13 hours.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from PubChem’s detailed hydromorphone entry, appearing in the Biological Half-Life section (citing the canine pharmacokinetic study by KuKanich & Spade, Vet J 2013; PMID 23098635) and immediately preceding the Mechanism of Action section, which describes hydromorphone’s mu-opioid receptor agonism (with minor delta and kappa affinity) and its onset/duration for immediate- and extended-release forms.\n                "}

They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.

In general, Maternal use of oral opioids during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, which may progress to rare but severe central nervous system depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. If hydromorphone is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of hydromorphone to 2 to 3 days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring.[1] If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from the “Summary of Use during Lactation” subsection in the “Effects During Pregnancy and Lactation” section of the comprehensive Hydromorphone compound summary, providing guidance on neonatal risks and breastfeeding recommendations.\n                "}

The infant was brought to the emergency department because of excessive drowsiness. The infant was having intermittent bradycardia and had an apneic event requiring bag-valve-mask intervention.

Fifteen minutes later, he had another apneic episode that resolved rapidly with another dose of naloxone. Extensive laboratory testing was performed and all tests were negative, including a urine opiate screen.

Occupational exposure to hydromorphone may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hydromorphone is produced or used(SRC). Use information indicates that the general population may be exposed to hydromorphone via administration of the compound for therapeutic purposes or as a drug of abuse(SRC).

It reports that a NIOSH survey estimated 3,537 U.S. workers (predominantly female) potentially experienced occupational dermal exposure during manufacture or handling; it also notes general‐population contact occurs via medical use or illicit abuse.
