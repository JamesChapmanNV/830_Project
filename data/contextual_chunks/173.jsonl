Those using MDMA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength should be extremely careful. Based on research from multiple labs, the effects of MDMA can increase non-linearly with increases in dosage. That is, increasing dosage from 100mg to 120mg (a 20% increase in dosage) can cause more than a 20% increase in experiential effects level. See Harris DS, Baggott M, et al. 2002 and de la Torre R, Farre M, et al. 2000. The current theory is that some metabolic pathway becomes saturated/overwhelmed somewhere around 1.5mg/kg and above, resulting in higher plasma levels and effects levels. The specific metabolic reason for this non-linearity has not yet been proven.\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears at the end of the negative effects list for MDMA, summarizing rare but serious risks such as possible neurotoxicity and death, and transitions into a description and cautionary information about individual sensitivity, dose-response non-linearity, and safety warnings for new or uncertain users.\n                "}
