Medically they are used to treat depression, obesity, and other conditions. In addition to the physical effects of amphetamines, users report feeling restless, anxious and moody. Increased doses intensify the effects, and users may become excited or talkative and experience a false sense of self-confidence or superiority. They may behave in a bizarre manner; some become aggressive and hostile. Prolonged use of amphetamines can lead to malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies, skin disorders, ulcers, lack of sleep, weight loss and depression. Frequent use of large amounts of amphetamines can cause brain damage that results in speech and thought disturbances.

Antipsychotic medications such as Haldol, Thorazine, and others are also used to buffer the effects of unbalanced dopamine, the neurotransmitter that moderates paranoia and pleasurable sensation.

While toxic symptoms occasionally occur as an idiosyncracy at dosages as low as 2 mg, they are rare with doses of less than 15 mg; 30 mg can produce severe reactions, yet doses of 400 to 500 mg are not necessarily fatal. In rats, the oral LD50 of dextroamphetamine sulfate is 96.8 mg/kg.\n\nSymptoms\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in Erowid's overview of amphetamines, following sections on general effects, addiction, and withdrawal. It specifically addresses the risks of amphetamine use during pregnancy—including birth defects and neonatal withdrawal—and then transitions to details about symptoms and treatment of overdose.\n                "}

Management of acute amphetamine intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, administration of a cathartic and sedation. Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendation in this regard. Acidification of the urine increases amphetamine excretion, but is believed to increase risk of acute renal failure if myoglobinuria is present. If acute, severe hypertension complicates amphetamine overdosage, administration of intravenous phentolamine (Regitine (r) CIBA) has been suggested. However a gradual drop in blood pressure will usually result when sufficient sedation has been achieved. Chlorpromazine antagonizes the central stimulation effects of amphetamines and can be used to treat amphetamine intoxication.\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage provides medical guidance on the treatment of acute amphetamine overdose, detailing recommended interventions and precautions.
