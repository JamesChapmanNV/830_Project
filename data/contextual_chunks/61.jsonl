A hallucinogenic alkaloid isolated in trace amounts from Psilocybe mushrooms (also known as Teonanacatl or \"magic mushrooms\"). It has a role as a hallucinogen, a serotonergic agonist, a fungal metabolite, a human xenobiotic metabolite and a drug metabolite. It is a tryptamine alkaloid, a tertiary amino compound, a member of hydroxyindoles and a member of phenols. It is functionally related to a N,N-dimethyltryptamine.
