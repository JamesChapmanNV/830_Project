The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\n\nFentanyl's strong potency compared to that of morphine is mainly due to its high lipophilicity (the ability of a chemical compound to dissolve in fats, oils, and lipids). Because of this, it can more easily penetrate the central nervous system in comparison to other opioids.\n\nSubjective effects\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears after the chemistry overview and explains the pharmacological mechanisms and potency of fentanyl, describing how its opioid activity produces effects such as euphoria and pain relief by mimicking endorphins in the body, and how its high lipophilicity contributes to its strong potency compared to other opioids like morphine.
