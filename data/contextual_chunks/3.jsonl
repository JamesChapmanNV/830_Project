It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers. The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976. During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the “Description” section of the amphetamine entry—immediately after its core identifiers—providing a concise historical overview from its 1910 discovery and 1927 synthesis through its 1935 racemic registration, chiral dextro-/levo-isomerism, 1976 FDA approval, World War II military use, and postwar illicit proliferation.\n                "}

ADHD comes from a complex interplay between interdependent genetic and non-genetic factors which cause complex mental disorders in children and teenagers. On the other hand, narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder typically resenting during adolescence and characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.

Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found. Once inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces other monoamines to be stored by VMAT2 which produces the pumping of the neurotransmitters into the synapse by a process called retro-transport. This process of release of neurotransmitters is approximately fourfold more potent in the d-isomer for the release of dopamine.

The mechanism of action of amphetamine is complemented by the inhibition of the reuptake and of monoamine oxidase which acts synergistically to produce a significant increase the monoamine concentration. This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. From this specific action, the l-isomer is known to be significantly less potent.

Amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, & mescaline were acetylated with trifluoracetic anhydride in the presence of mercuric trifluoracetate as a catalyst. The reagent can acetylate the amine directly in the form of free base or salt. Slightly varying procedures were used, depending on whether the drugs were in solid form or were obtained in organic fluids such as urine. Samples were analyzed on a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with an electron impact source.

They neutralize acids to form salts plus water. These acid-base reactions are exothermic. The amount of heat that is evolved per mole of amine in a neutralization is largely independent of the strength of the amine as a base. Amines may be incompatible with isocyanates, halogenated organics, peroxides, phenols (acidic), epoxides, anhydrides, and acid halides. Flammable gaseous hydrogen is generated by amines in combination with strong reducing agents, such as hydrides.\n\n11.8.4 Hazardous Reactivities and Incompatibilities\n\nIncompatible materials: Acids, Oxidizing agents, Alkali metals, Strong oxidizing agents, Strong acids, Acid chlorides, Acid anhydrides, Reducing agents, Strong reducing agents, Phosphorus halides\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from Section 11.8 (“Stability and Reactivity”) of the Amphetamine chemical safety profile.

Agitation, confusion, mood elevation, increased wakefulness, talkativeness, irritability and panic attacks are typical. Chronic abuse can cause delusions and paranoia. A withdrawal syndrome occurs after abrupt cessation following chronic use. Amphetamine appears to exert most or all of its effect in the CNS by causing release of biogenic amines, especially norepinephrine and dopamine, from storage sites in nerve terminals. It may also slow down catecholamine metabolism by inhibiting monoamine oxidase. Children appear to be more susceptible than adults and are less likely to have developed tolerance. The use of amphetamine for medical indications does not pose a significant risk to the fetus for congenital anomalies.

Heart rate is often reflexly slowed; with large doses, cardiac arrhythmias may occur. Cardiac output is not enhanced by therapeutic doses, & cerebral blood flow does not change much. The l-isomer is slightly more potent than the d-isomer in its cardiovascular actions. In general, smooth muscles respond to amphetamine as they do to other sympathomimetic amines. ... Pain & difficulty in micturition occasionally occur. The GI effects of amphetamine are unpredictable. If enteric activity is pronounced, amphetamine may cause relaxation & delay the movement of intestinal contents; if the gut is already relaxed, the opposite effect may occur. The response of the human uterus varies, but usually there is an increase in tone.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Section 12.1.15 “Human Toxicity Excerpts” – under “Signs and Symptoms,” this passage summarizes amphetamine’s cardiovascular and smooth-muscle effects, noting oral doses raise systolic/diastolic blood pressure with reflex bradycardia, dose-dependent arrhythmias, no major change in cardiac output or cerebral blood flow, greater potency of the l-isomer, and variable gastrointestinal (motility delays or stimulation), urinary (pain, dysuria) and uterine (increased tone) responses.\n                "}
