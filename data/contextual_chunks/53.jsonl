Morphine acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain but has a high potential for addiction, with tolerance and both physical and psychological dependence developing rapidly. Morphine is the most abundant opiate found in Papaver somniferum (the opium poppy). It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a vasodilator agent, an anaesthetic, a drug allergen and a geroprotector. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a tertiary amino compound and a morphinane alkaloid. It is a conjugate base of a morphine(1+). It derives from a hydride of a morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is from the page’s top-of-record summary, where key identifiers and a concise overview of morphine are presented: its common synonyms (Morphia, Morphium, etc.), molecular weight (285.34 g/mol), PubChem computation details, database creation/modification dates, and a brief description of its chemical classification (a morphinane alkaloid and tertiary amino compound), natural source (opium poppy), major pharmacological actions (potent CNS-acting mu-opioid agonist analgesic), and other roles.\n                "}

Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.\n\nMorphine, the main alkaloid of opium, was first obtained from poppy seeds in 1805. It is a potent analgesic, though its use is limited due to tolerance, withdrawal, and the risk of abuse. Morphine is still routinely used today, though there are a number of semi-synthetic opioids of varying strength such as [codeine], [fentanyl], [methadone], [hydrocodone], [hydromorphone], [meperidine], and [oxycodone]. Morphine was granted FDA approval in 1941.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nMorphine Sulfate (has salt form);\n\n\n\nMorphine Hydrochloride (has salt form);\n\n\n\nNicomorphine (is active moiety of) ...

Side-effects were similar, for example, nausea (P=0.383, nine studies, 456 patients receiving hydromorphone and 460 morphine); vomiting (P=0.306, six studies, 246 patients receiving hydromorphone and 239 morphine); or itching (P=0.249, eight studies, 405 patients receiving hydromorphone, 410 morphine). This suggests some advantage of hydromorphone over morphine for analgesia. Additional potential clinical pharmacological advantages with regard to side-effects, such as safety in renal failure or during acute analgesia titration, are based on limited evidence and require substantiation by further studies.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Context: This excerpt appears in the “Therapeutic Uses” section of the Morphine compound page, summarizing a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing morphine and hydromorphone.

These safety risks are potentially harmful interactions with numerous other medications, problems with the adrenal glands, and decreased sex hormone levels. We are requiring changes to the labels of all opioid drugs to warn about these risks. Opioids can interact with antidepressants and migraine medicines to cause a serious central nervous system reaction called serotonin syndrome, in which high levels of the chemical serotonin build up in the brain and cause toxicity. Taking opioids may lead to a rare, but serious condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol helps the body respond to stress. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as reduced interest in sex, impotence, or infertility.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in section 7.14 (“Drug Warnings”) of the Morphine compound page, where FDA-mandated safety label changes for the entire opioid class are summarized—highlighting risks of drug interactions (e.g., serotonin syndrome), adrenal insufficiency, and opioid-related declines in sex hormones.\n                "}

The bioavailability of morphine is 80-100%. There is significant first-pass metabolism, therefore oral doses are 6 times larger than parenteral doses to achieve the same effect. Morphine reaches steady-state concentrations after 24-48 hours. Parenteral morphine has a Tmax of 15 minutes and oral morphine has a Tmax of 90 minutes, with a Cmax of 283nmol/L. The AUC of morphine is 225-290nmol\\*h/L.\n\nRoute of Elimination\n\n70-80% of an administered dose is excreted within 48 hours. Morphine is predominantly eliminated in the urine with 2-10% of a dose recovered as the unchanged parent drug. 7-10% of a dose of morphine is eliminated in the feces.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the ADME section (9.5) of the morphine PubChem entry.

Morphine is less lipophilic than heroin and does not cross back across the blood-brain barrier as readily. Morphine readily undergoes the additional phase I metabolic transformation of oxidative N-demethylation by CYP2D6.

However, given the high prevalence of sIgE antibodies to these compounds in an allergic population, the predictive value of these tests leaves significant doubts. This study aims at verifying the predictive value of positive poppy seed and morphine sIgE assays results. A total of 22 individuals with a positive sIgE to poppy seed or morphine were selected.

The remaining 4 patients were classified as nonresponders. Positive sIgE results to poppy seed and morphine are not per se predictive for genuine opiate allergy and should not be used in isolation to diagnose morphine or codeine allergy.

It is an opiate agonist used, often in the form of its sulfate salt, to relieve severe, acute pain or moderate to severe, chronic pain. The drug is also used parenterally as a supplement for analgesia during labor. Morphine is the drug of choice in relieving pain of myocardial infarction. It may be used in veterinary care as an analgesic (narcotic), preanesthetic, antitussive, and antiperstaltic. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Morphine sulfate misuse is essentially observed among regular heroin injectors. The most serious adverse effect of morphine is respiratory depression. Constipation is a common side effect. In patients with myocardial infarction, morphine causes a decrease in systemic vascular resistance which may result in a transient fall in systemic arterial pressure leading to severe hypotension. Morphine should be used with caution in patients with toxic psychoses. Several manufacturers recommended that morphine\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the Toxicity section (Section 13.1.1, “Toxicity Summary”) of the Morphine record, where the document summarizes the compound’s physical characteristics, clinical uses (e.g., analgesia in myocardial infarction and labor), and key human toxicity concerns (respiratory depression, hypotension, constipation, and misuse patterns).\n                "}

It causes a host of symptoms related to depression of the CNS. Severe respiratory depression is the most feared complication of morphine in cases of overdose. Immediate injection of naloxone is required to reverse the effects of morphine.\n\nThe precise mechanism of the analgesic action of morphine is unknown. However, specific CNS opiate receptors have been identified and likely play a role in the expression of analgesic effects. Morphine first acts on the mu-opioid receptors. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. It has been shown that morphine binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Section 13.1 (Toxicological Information) – Acute toxicity and mechanism of action: summary of morphine’s overdose risk (CNS and respiratory depression), naloxone reversal, and mu‐opioid receptor/GABA‐interneuron analgesic pathway.\n                "}

However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.If you have been taking morphine regularly or have a dependency (also called opioid use disorder), you should not stop suddenly (also called “cold turkey”).
