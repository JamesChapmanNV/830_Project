It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an opioid analgesic and an antitussive. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a morphinane-like compound. It derives from a hydride of a morphinan.\n\nHydrocodone is a DEA Schedule II controlled substance.

Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.\n\nHydrocodone is a synthetic opioid derivative of codeine. It is commonly used in combination with [acetaminophen] to control moderate to severe pain. Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by [dextromethorphan] in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite, [hydromorphone] has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain. The FDA first approved Hydrocodone for use as part of the cough suppressant syrup Hycodan in March of 1943.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nHydrocodone Bitartrate (has salt form);\n\n\n\nBenzhydrocodone Hydrochloride (is active moiety of);\n\n\n\nHydrocodone hydrochloride (is active moiety of).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from the top‐level “Description” and “Identifiers” summary of the Hydrocodone compound page, noting its DEA Schedule II status, semi-synthetic origin from codeine, primary uses (pain relief with acetaminophen, historical cough suppression), active metabolite hydromorphone, first FDA approval in 1943, and references to related salt and moiety forms.\n                "}

Though hydromorphone is active it is not present in sufficient quantities to contribute significantly to hydrocodone's therapeutic effects. Both hydrocodone and hydromorphone form 6-α- and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites through 6-ketoreduction. The hydroxy metabolites and hydromorphone can form glucuronide conjugates. Hydrocodone also undergoes oxidative N-demthylation to norhydrocodone. O-demethylation is primarily catalyzed by CYP2D6 while N-demethylation is primarily CYP3A4.\n\nLike other phenanthrene derivatives, hydrocodone is probably metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly in urine. Metabolism of hydrocodone includes O-demethylation, N-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction.\n\nAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2015; Drug Information 2015.

Benzhydrocodone is a hydrocodone prodrug that is rapidly converted into hydrocodone in the gastrointestinal tract. Maternal use of oral opioids during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, which may progress to rare but severe central nervous system depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. If hydrocodone is required by the mother of a newborn, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral hydrocodone to 2 to 3 days at a maximum dosage of 30 mg daily with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately.\n\n◉ Effects in Breastfed Infants\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from the “Effects During Pregnancy and Lactation” section of the Hydrocodone drug monograph, detailing breastfeeding guidance—maternal dosing limits, infant monitoring parameters, and risks of neonatal sedation and CNS depression.\n                "}

Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hydrocodone via ingestion of drinking water. Exposure to hydrocodone among the general population may be extended to those administered the drug, an opiate(SRC). Because hydrocodone induces side effects similar to codeine and morphine, exposure may also occur via illicit use as it has an appreciable abuse and dependence potential(1).\n\n(1) Friderichs E et al; Analgesics, Centrally Acting.
