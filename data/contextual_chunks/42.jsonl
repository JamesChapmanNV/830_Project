However, for its effect to generate, the neurotransmitter is required. The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam are thought to be related to the binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels in which the sustained repetitive firing gets limited by the slow recovery of sodium channels due to the benzodiazepine effect. The effect of lorazepam seems to be very compartmental which was observed with a different generation of sleepiness and a dizziness effect.\n\n8.2 MeSH Pharmacological Classification\n\nAntiemetics\n\nDrugs used to prevent NAUSEA or VOMITING.

Concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Therefore, the prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids together should be reserved for patients with inadequate alternative treatment options. The dosage and duration of lorazepam must be limited based on the indication, and patients require surveillance for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression. While lorazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines, is rarely associated with elevated serum ALT, clinically apparent liver injury from lorazepam is infrequent. The clinical pattern of acute liver injury from benzodiazepines is typically cholestatic.\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on the toxicological profile of lorazepam, highlighting clinical signs and symptoms associated with overdose, risks from concurrent substance use, and general guidance for overdose management.

The latency to onset was 9 months and the clinical pattern that of a self-limited cholestatic hepatitis that resolved within 2 months of stopping. Similar isolated single cases of clinically apparent hepatitis have been reported with other benzodiazepines including alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam and triazolam. The clinical pattern of acute liver injury from benzodiazepines is typically cholestatic and mild-to-moderate in severity with a latency of 1 to 6 months.
