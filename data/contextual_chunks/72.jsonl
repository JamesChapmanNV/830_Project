This drug decreases the time to fall asleep (sleep latency), increases the duration of sleep, and decreases the number of awakenings during sleep in patients with temporary (transient) insomnia. It is available in both immediate acting and extended release forms,. Its tolerability profile is favorable when administered according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a low risk of drug withdrawal, drug dependence, and drug tolerance. In addition, zolpidem improves sleep quality in patients suffering from chronic insomnia and can show mild muscle relaxant properties.

During clinical trials with patients using zolpidem on an ‘as-needed’ basis, zolpidem use resulted in global improvements in sleep. Zolpidem has been demonstrated to decrease sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies. In studies measuring the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage, zolpidem has primarily been shown to preserve sleep stages.

In contrast to benzodiazepine drugs, which are found to modulate all benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in a non-selective fashion, zolpidem binds the (BZ1) receptor specifically with a potent affinity for the alpha 1/alpha 5 subunits (in vitro). More recent studies suggest that zolpidem binds primarily to the alpha 1, 2, and 3 subunits of the GABA receptor,,, and not the alpha 5 subunit. The (_BZ1_) receptor is found primarily on the Lamina IV of the brain sensorimotor cortical regions, substantia nigra (pars reticulata), cerebellum molecular layer, olfactory bulb, ventral thalamic complex, pons, inferior colliculus, and globus pallidus. Specific and selective binding of zolpidem on the (BZ1) receptor is not considered absolute, however, this binding could potentially explain the relative lack of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant activity in animal studies in addition to the preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of zolpidem at hypnotic doses.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage appears within the \"Mechanism of Action\" section of the Zolpidem compound page, discussing how zolpidem interacts with GABAA receptor subtypes. It contrasts zolpidem’s selectivity for the BZ1 (ω1) site—mainly binding to alpha 1, 2, and 3 subunits and not alpha 5—with the broader, non-selective modulation by benzodiazepines, explaining how this receptor profile relates to zolpidem’s distinct clinical effects, such as preserved deep sleep and minimal muscle relaxant or anticonvulsant action.\n                "}

The manufacturer states that excess sedation in infants exposed to zolpidem through breastmilk has been reported, although details are lacking. Some expert opinion recommends against zolpidem use during breastfeeding, primarily because of minimal documentation. Monitor the infant for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.\n\n◉ Effects in Breastfed Infants\n\nThe mother of a newborn was taking 5 to 10 mg of zolpidem nightly. At the one-month checkup, no adverse effects were noted by the patient’s pediatrician.\n\nThree infants were breastfed by mothers taking zolpidem 5 mg daily (n = 2) or as needed (n = 1).
