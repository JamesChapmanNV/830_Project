Some people enjoy lower doses in more social contexts such as dancing while others prefer stronger psychedelic experiences while lying down. There seems to be a crucial line where the dissociative effects assert themselves and a person loses grasp of his or her primary senses. A further line exists where the user completely loses consciousness. Boosting (taking one or more additional doses after the initial dose) is quite common, especially with insufflated ketamine, with some people choosing to use low doses at frequent intervals. Tolerance is appreciable, with some users reporting that several weeks are required between uses to again achieve full effects from a given dose. For most people, effects are linear with dose, and positive experiences can be achieved from low doses.\n\nInjected (IM):\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on the typical dosage ranges and administration methods for ketamine, outlining how different amounts and routes (including injection, insufflation, oral, and rectal use) produce varying effects.

Fully anaesthetic IM doses are about 1 mg/lb (2.2 mg/kg). Due to the volume of liquid when using 50 mg/ml material, two injections are usually made instead of one. Sterility of the material and the needle are imperative. Most people obtain psychedelic effects at an IM dose of 100 mg. Some users report soreness at the injection site(s) for several days or weeks; such soreness is minimized when users relax the muscle being injected into, and when the injection is made slowly, taking 15-30 seconds to push a ml or less of liquid. Intravenous (IV) injection is not recommended: rapid IV injection can cause the user to stop breathing, while slower IV injection can cause a self-injector to lose consciousness with a needle left in his or her vein before the injection is complete, possibly resulting in bleeding that continues until self-awareness has returned.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in the section on typical ketamine dosages, specifically detailing intramuscular (IM) injection for achieving psychedelic or anesthetic effects, recommended dose ranges, and associated safety precautions.

A lower, more social nasal dose that still produces distinct effects would be around 0.25 mg/lb (0.55mg/kg), with low doses producing shorter and milder effects. One technique users employ is to consume one \"bump\" of powdered ketamine up each nostril every few minutes using a \"bullet\"-style device until desired effects are reached. Some users report that smaller amounts taken in this way work better than snorting a large line all at once. Presumably the reason for this relates to better absorption in the nose when taken over time, whereas when it is consumed all at once some of it is lost down the back of the throat via post-nasal drip. Compared to many other commonly snorted recreational drugs, ketamine is relatively comfortable in the nasal region; however, many people dislike the taste if/when it begins to drip down the back of their throats.\n\nOral:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in the section detailing typical ketamine dosages and methods of administration, specifically describing recommended amounts and user practices for insufflated (snorted) ketamine, followed by guidance for oral use.

Anaesthetic oral doses begin at around 4.0 mg/lb (8.8 mg/kg). A maximum oral dose of 3 mg/lb (6.6 mg/kg) should be set in order to allow for adequate recovery. Increasing oral dosage above 1.0-2.0 mg/lb (2.2-4.4 mg/kg) yields little psychedelic advantage and can result in greater temporary memory loss. A minimum dose of around 150-175 mg may be required for a psychedelic experience. Higher oral doses have rapidly diminishing returns over lower doses, resulting in stomach upset, greater temporary memory loss, and little psychedelic advantage.\n\nRectal:\n\nRectal doses range from 0.6 mg/lb to 3.5 mg/lb (1.3-7.7 mg/kg), but the higher doses can produce extremely strong effects, and some users report strong effects even from the lighter end of this dose range.

Liquid ketamine is sometimes converted into powder for nasal or oral use by gently boiling off the solution or by pouring the material into a glass baking dish and subjecting it to short bursts in a microwave until the liquid has evaporated.

To reduce the likelihood of nausea, food is not generally consumed within ninety minutes before the trip, and is avoided for longer periods of time if possible. While vomiting is rare, travelling to the bathroom is no fun, as movement can increase nausea. Cautious users may keep a bucket available as a precaution.

Most users consider this to be a waste of their tripping experience, especially as it can make them sick to their stomachs. While fatalities caused by the direct pharmacological effects of ketamine are nearly unheard of at normal recreational doses, ketamine is a powerful anaesthetic and being anaesthetized, semi-conscious, or unconscious carries distinct risks. Body positions that restrict breathing or blood-flow (e.g. \"child's pose\" or face down into a pillow) can result in serious injury or death even if the person is conscious. Extreme care should be taken before combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, opiates, barbiturates, and/or benzodiazepines. This can be very dangerous.

Problematic use is sometimes accompanied by paranoia, an increase in the sense of synchronicity in daily experiences, and egocentrism (the world revolves around the user). With compulsive use, a user may also have impaired judgment with respect to what activities or contexts are appropriate while under the influence (e.g. driving a car, going to a job, or taking a bath), which can increase the risk of accidents.

Frequent ketamine use has been associated with urinary tract symptoms that can include increased frequency of urination, urinary incontinence, pain during urination, passing blood in the urine, and reduced bladder size. In several reported severe cases, surgical intervention to remove the bladder was deemed necessary by clinicians. The wide dose-response range leading to documented cases suggests that individual responses to ketamine may be idiosyncratic and unpredictable, making it unclear what level and frequency of use may lead to urinary problems.
