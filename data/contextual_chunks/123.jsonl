It takes another decade for p2p to become unavailable, at which point ephedrine and pseudoephedrine became the top precursors used to synthesize methamphetamine. [More Info] Late 1980's Smoked Methamphetamine becomes more popular. c.1990 In the first Gulf War, British RAF Royal Air Force and American Air Force introduced Dexedrine for pilots engaging in long air-raids/battles - a practice still used through at least 2010 by both countries. 1996 U.S. Congress passes the Methamphetamine Control Act establishing new controls over key ingredients and strengthening criminal penalties for possession, distribution and\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is part of a detailed chronological timeline documenting key events in the history, regulation, and use of amphetamines.
