In 2011, available as combination buprenorphine and naloxone preparations at a 4:1 ratio: 2mg buprenorphine+0.5mg naloxone and 8mg + 2mg.

A Home Office license is required to export buprenorphine. It is commonly used as a treatment for heroin, methadone, or other severe opiate addiction and is often a preferred choice of medication for the treatment of heroin dependency.
