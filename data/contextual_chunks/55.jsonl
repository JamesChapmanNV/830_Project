Oxazepam has a variety of uses, including several outside of its approved indications such as confusional arousals, sleep terrors, social phobia, PTSD, insomnia, PMDD, and catatonia. Currently, oxazepam is not FDA-approved for use in children under the age of six due to the risk of respiratory arrest.

However, the molecular basis for this phenomenon is currently unknown.

Phenotype-genotype studies were conducted using microsomes and DNA prepared from the same set of 54 human livers. Sequencing of the UGT2B15 gene revealed three nonsynonymous polymorphisms, D85Y, T352I, and K523T, with variant allele frequencies of 0.56, 0.02, and 0.40, respectively.

GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. The inhibitory potentials produced by GABA neurotransmission play an integral role in the suppression and control of epileptiform nerve firing such as that seen in epilepsy, which makes the GABA system a desirable target in the treatment of epilepsy. Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) function.

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA-evoked chloride currents through a binding site on the GABAA receptor-operated chloride channel. GABA agonists and benzodiazepine agonists simultaneously enhance the binding of the other to its receptor. Benzodiazepine binding appears to shift the GABA receptor from a low affinity state to a high affinity state and also stabilizes the receptor in a conformation that permits the ion channel to remain open. Similarly, GABA binding also enhances benzodiazepine agonist binding to its receptor via the same mechanism. Thus, GABA receptor agonist and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are positive allosteric effectors for each other.\n\nDart, R.C. (ed). Medical Toxicology.

GABA receptors are ionotropic chloride-linked channel receptors that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. When activated by GABA, the GABA receptor/chloride ionophore complex undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. Benzodiazepines are believed to exert their effect by increasing the effect of GABA at its receptor. Benzodiazepine binding increases chloride conductance in the presence of GABA by increasing the frequency at which the channel opens. In contrast, barbiturates increase chloride conductance in the presence of GABA by prolonging the time in which the channel remains open. There are 18 subtypes of the GABA receptor subunits.

Death may occur before hospital arrival due to sedation (particularly if combined with other CNS depressants), but the course of patients reaching hospital is generally uncomplicated. The clinical effects of benzodiazepine poisoning are due entirely to CNS depression. Severe poisoning may occasionally develop hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Respiratory and CNS depression may lead to aspiration pneumonia. However, deep coma (GCS less than 8) is unusual. Most patients are stuporous or still responsive to painful stimuli unless they have coingested other sedating drugs. Ataxia and nystagmus are common in nontolerant patients, but if pronounced, the possibility of concomitant drug over dose should be raised (i.e., anticonvulsant). /Benzodiazepines/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This text is drawn from section 12.1.16 (“Human Toxicity Excerpts”) of the full Oxazepam compound report—part of the broader toxicity chapter (section 12)—and summarizes the clinical signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepine overdose (central nervous system depression, ataxia, nystagmus, potential hypotension, hypothermia, and rare deep coma) in patients exposed to Oxazepam.\n                "}

Particulate-phase oxazepam may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Oxazepam does not absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm(3), and is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).\n\n(1) Bidleman TF; Environ Sci Technol 22: 361-367 (1988)\n\n(2) Lyman WJ; p. 31 in Environmental Exposure From Chemicals Vol I, Neely WB, Blau GE, eds, Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press (1985)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This text appears in the “Environmental Fate” subsection of the Ecological Information section of the Oxazepam record.
