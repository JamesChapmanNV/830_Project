Formerly used as an anaesthetic agent, it exhibits both hallucinogenic and neurotoxic effects. It has a role as a neurotoxin, a psychotropic drug, an anaesthetic and a NMDA receptor antagonist. It is a member of piperidines and a member of benzenes. It derives from a hydride of a piperidine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is the prominent summary box at the top of the Phencyclidine (PCP) PubChem compound page, displaying key identifiers, structural images, molecular formula, synonyms, molecular weight, safety classification, and a brief chemical and pharmacological description.

It is a Depressants substance.\n\nA hallucinogen formerly used as a veterinary anesthetic, and briefly as a general anesthetic for humans. Phencyclidine is similar to ketamine in structure and in many of its effects. Like ketamine, it can produce a dissociative state. It exerts its pharmacological action through inhibition of NMDA receptors (receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate). As a drug of abuse, it is known as PCP and Angel Dust.\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\nPhencyclidine.png\n\n1.2 3D Conformer\n\n2 Names and Identifiers\n\n2.1 Computed Descriptors\n\n2.1.1 IUPAC Name\n\n1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine\n\nComputed by Lexichem TK 2.7.0 (PubChem release 2025.04.14)\n\n2.1.2 InChI\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides a general overview and summary of phencyclidine, covering its controlled substance status, pharmacological classification, former medical uses, similarity to ketamine, dissociative and hallucinogenic effects, and mechanism of action as an NMDA receptor antagonist.

The “out-of-body” intense psychological and behavioral effects of low doses of phencyclidine led to its abuse. In the late 1960s and 1970s, phencyclidine (“angel dust”) became a widely used hallucinogenic drug. The effects were often extreme, marked by acute psychosis and aggressive and violent behaviors, and overdoses led to many emergency room visits and deaths from status epilepticus, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis and subsequent renal, respiratory and hepatic failure.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in the \"Related Records\" section, summarizing cross-references to scientific and genetic databases, followed by links to associated chemicals (such as phencyclidine hydrochloride) and external resources (NCBI LinkOut).

This bizarre behavior, characterized by confusion, vivid dreaming, and hallucinations, is termed an \"emergence reaction\".

The most violent emergence reactions follow an intravenous dose of approximately 0.25 mg/kg (total: 20 mg) of phencyclidine. The mildest degrees of agitation produced by phencyclidine resemble the effects of ethanol intoxication.\n\nGoldfrank, L.R., Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies 9th Ed. 2011., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y., p. 1196\n\nBreast feeding should be avoided after phencyclidine use, but a sufficient duration of abstinence is undefined.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears in the \"Drug and Medication Information\" part of the document, specifically following a discussion of phencyclidine's former therapeutic uses and clinical studies, and just before \"Drug Warnings.\" It transitions from summarizing clinical applications and withdrawal due to adverse effects to highlighting safety concerns and side effects associated with phencyclidine (PCP) use, particularly emergence reactions and recommendations regarding breastfeeding.\n                "}

It is a major excitatory receptor in the brain. Normal physiological function requires that the activated receptor fluxes positive ions through the channel part of the receptor. PCP enters the ion channel from the outside of the neuron and binds, reversibly, to a site in the channel pore, blocking the flux of positive ions into the cell. PCP therefore inhibits depolarization of neurons and interferes with cognitive and other functions of the nervous system.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in section 8.6 \"Mechanism of Action\" within the Pharmacology and Biochemistry part of the document. It explains how phencyclidine (PCP) acts at the molecular level by describing its interaction with the NMDA receptor: PCP blocks the receptor’s ion channel, thereby inhibiting positive ion flow into neurons and interfering with normal neuronal signaling. This mechanistic detail provides the biochemical basis for PCP’s psychoactive and neurotoxic effects discussed throughout the document.\n                "}

During the last decade several studies have indicated that disturbed activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be closely related to PCP-induced psychosis. Systemic administration of PCP produces long-lasting activation of medial PFC (mPFC) neurons in rats, almost in parallel with augmentation of locomotor activity and behavioral stereotypies.

This method was used to determine the levels of PCP in postmortem human blood samples. The LLOD in blood was 1 ng ml-1. Blood PCP concentrations were also determined separately using GC and flame ionization detection (FID). Blood calibration standards and serum calibration standards yielded similar concentrations when used to quantitate authentic human blood samples that tested positive for PCP under the GC-FID method. Extraction of PCP from serum required fewer steps and therefore could be used as a calibration matrix in place of blood.

It is a Schedule II Controlled Substance. PCP was formerly used as a preinduction anesthetic and as an animal tranquilizer. It has no current medical indications, although it is still used illegally as a hallucinogen. HUMAN STUDIES: PCP causes distortion of perception and produces a feeling of detachment of dissociation from the user's surroundings and self. It is not a classic hallucinogen but better described as a dissociative agent or anesthetic. The hallmark of PCP toxicity is the recurring delusion of superhuman strength and invulnerability resulting from both its anesthetic and dissociative properties. There are case reports of patients presenting with trauma either from jumping from high altitudes, fighting large crowds or the police, or self-mutilation. Children have become intoxicated by ingesting the butts of used PCP-impregnated cigarettes or from passive inhalation of sidestream smoke.

However, occupational exposure to phencyclidine should be low or non-existent since phencyclidine is not legally produced in the US. The general public is not likely to be exposed to phencyclidine. Use data indicates exposure to phencyclidine among the general population is likely limited to individuals involved in its illegal manufacture and individuals who engage in illicit use of products containing phencyclidine, via inhalation of powder, inhalation of smoke and ingestion.
