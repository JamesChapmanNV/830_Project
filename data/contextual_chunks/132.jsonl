Ketamine was used for anaesthesia because it suppresses breathing much less than most other available anaesthetics, but in the 1970's patients began to report unwanted visions while under its influence. In 1978, John Lilly published his book \"The Scientist\" and Ketamine popularity grew through the 1980s until in 1995 the DEA added Ketamine to its \"emerging drugs list\". In 1998 & 1999, Ketamine was lumped by media and legislators with GHB as a 'date rape drug' and a 'club drug' and was emergency scheduled by the DEA on August 12, 1999.\n\nTerminology / Slang #\n\nBrand Names:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in the Ketamine Basics section after brief overviews of its chemistry and legal status.
