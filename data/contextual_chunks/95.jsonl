Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-DMT is substituted at R4 of its indole heterocycle with an hydroxyl (-OH) functional group; it also contains two methyl groups CH3- bound to the terminal amine RN of the ethyl side chain. This makes psilocin the 4-hydroxy structural analog of DMT, and dephosphorylated analog of psilocybin.\n\nPsilocin can be obtained by dephosphorylation of natural psilocybin under strongly acidic or under alkaline conditions via hydrolysis,[citation needed] which is how it becomes metabolically active in the human body as well.[citation needed]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in the \"Chemistry\" section of a comprehensive article on psilocin, following the introductory summary and historical background.

It is most often self-regulating.\n\nTolerance to the effects of psilocin is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Psilocin presents cross-tolerance with all psychedelics, meaning that after the consumption of psilocin all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.\n\nLegal status\n\nPsilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, meaning the possession and sale of it (including psilocin and psilocybin-containing mushrooms) is prohibited in most countries.[18]\n\nBelgium: Possession and sale of mushrooms have been illegal since 1988.[citation needed]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section appears toward the end of the Psilocin article, following discussions of the compound’s effects, pharmacology, and toxicity. It outlines the drug’s low addiction potential, rapid development of tolerance, and cross-tolerance with other psychedelics, then transitions to a summary of its international legal status, providing country-specific regulations relating to possession, sale, and use.\n                "}
