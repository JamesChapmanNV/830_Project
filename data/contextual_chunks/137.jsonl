Ketamine is now federally illegal to possess in the United States without a license or prescription. Ketamine nasal spray was approved by the FDA in 2019 under the brand name Spravato containing only the enantiomer esketamine, as a therapeutic drug for \"treatment-resistant depression. See FDA Press Release (Mar 5, 2019) Ketamine is being studied for medical utility around the world. The medical research may eventually result in changes to the legal status. Because ketamine is an approved drug in most countries, it is already being used \"off label\" for treatment of depression and other indications in clinics around the world.\n\nU.S. STATE LAW #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears within a detailed Erowid page on the legal status of ketamine, providing an overview of U.S. federal scheduling and regulation history, specifically noting its classification as a Schedule III controlled substance since August 1999, federal illegality without a prescription, and its approved medical use via esketamine (Spravato).
