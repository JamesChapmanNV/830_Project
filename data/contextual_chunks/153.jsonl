It comes in a variety of forms, but is virtually always taken orally. Today, LSD is most commonly found in the form of small squares of paper called 'blotter' (full sheets of paper are decorated with artwork or designs, perforated, then soaked in liquid LSD solution and dried). Other forms include pills, gelatin sheets or shapes (pyramids, cubes, etc), liquid, liquid sugar cubes, and powder. Blotter is most common because it is easily produced, easily concealable and the format allows for few adulterant chemicals.\n\n[ Main LSD Vault ]\n\nDose #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is from the Erowid LSD Basics page within the Chemicals section, providing an introductory overview of LSD including its description, common forms, and basic usage information, situated before detailed sections on dosage, effects, risks, and legal status.\n                "}

A single hit of most blotter paper contains somewhere in this range, though this varies depending on the source and there is no way for the average user to determine the strength of a piece of blotter other than by word of mouth. In the 1960s and 1970s, when LSD came primarily in pill form, the average single dosage unit was somewhat higher than it is with today's blotter, more often in the 200-400 ug range. A drop of liquid can contain a huge amount of LSD but is generally made so that one drop is a single medium dose.\n\nPrice #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information about LSD dosing and typical dosage ranges, describing how doses have changed over time and explaining the variability in strength depending on form and source.

Captive markets such as raves generally produce high prices while friend to friend it is often sold at cheaper prices. Less common forms of LSD sell for somewhat higher prices ($8-10 for a single hit), and as with most substances, the price goes down if you buy in bulk. Sheets of 100 hits (blotter) generally range from $1-$2 per hit. One of the more novel things about the illicit LSD market is that within the LSD using community, it is somewhat common to give single doses away to friends and acquaintances at extremely cheap prices, if not free.\n\nLaw #\n\nLSD is illegal in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries.

As the effects become stronger, a wide variety of perceptual changes may occur; non-specific mental and physical stimulation, pupil dilation, closed and open eye patterning and visuals, changed thought patterns, feelings of insight, confusion, or paranoia, and quickly changing emotions (happiness, fear, giddiness, anxiety, anger, joy, irritation).\n\nOnset #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section from the Erowid LSD Basics page introduces common terminology and slang for LSD and its effects, providing readers with the language used to describe both the substance and the experience.
