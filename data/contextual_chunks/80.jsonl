This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as barbiturates and alcohol since they work in a similar fashion, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABAA receptor, thus their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABAA receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer[19]. Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and properly.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears within the \"Toxicity and harm potential\" section of the Lorazepam drug profile, specifically under \"Tolerance and addiction potential\" and transitioning into \"Overdose.\" It discusses how Lorazepam creates cross-tolerance with other benzodiazepines and then details the risks, mechanisms, and dangers of benzodiazepine overdose, especially when combined with other depressants like alcohol or barbiturates.\n                "}
