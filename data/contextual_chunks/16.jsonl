Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. It is a Opiates substance.\n\nFentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia. Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia. Fentanyl is related to other opioids like [morphine] and [oxycodone]. Fentanyl's high potency has also made it a common adulterant in illicit drugs, especially heroin. In 2017, 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths). Opioid overdoses kill an average of 11 Canadians daily. Fentanyl was FDA approved in 1968.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nFentanyl Citrate (has salt form);\n\n\n\nFentanyl Hydrochloride (has salt form).\n\nContents\n\n1 Structures\n\n1.1 2D Structure\n\nChemical Structure Depiction\n\nFentanyl.png\n\n1.2 3D Conformer\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Introductory summary of the Fentanyl compound page, presenting its DEA Schedule II classification, pharmacological background and history, clinical applications and overdose statistics, related salt forms, and the table of contents for detailed structures and identifiers.\n                "}

In addition, the drug may be used to prevent or relieve tachypnea and postoperative emergence delirium. Fentanyl citrate is used parenterally to provide preoperative anxiolysis and sedation and as a supplement to anesthesia. The drug may be especially useful preoperatively before surgery of short duration or minor surgery in outpatients and in diagnostic procedures or treatments that require the patient to be awake or very lightly anesthetized.

To investigate whether their tolerance development may be related to mu receptor desensitization, the cloned mouse mu receptor as well as mutant forms of the receptor were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and tested for their response to continuous opioid treatment. Fentanyl and its analogs potently bound to the mu receptor and effectively inhibited cAMP accumulation. Three-hour pretreatment of mu receptors with fentanyl and its analogs desensitized the mu receptor by uncoupling it from adenylyl cyclase. The fentanyl analogs caused a slight internalization of the mu receptor as accessed by antibody binding to the epitope-tagged mu receptor. Truncation of the mu receptor by removal of its carboxyl terminus at Glu341 did not affect the ability\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from the Pharmacology and Biochemistry section’s discussion of opioid tolerance mechanisms, where cell-based studies in HEK293 cells expressing mouse μ-opioid receptors demonstrate that prolonged exposure to fentanyl and its analogs (lofentanil, sufentanil) induces receptor desensitization—uncoupling μ-receptors from adenylyl cyclase—as a molecular basis for tolerance.\n                "}

Truncation of the mu receptor by removal of its carboxyl terminus at Glu341 did not affect the ability of the fentanyl analogs to bind to and activate the mu receptor nor did it prevent the fentanyl analogs from desensitizing the receptor. In a previous study we showed that morphine did not desensitize the cloned mu receptor even though it is a potent and effective agonist at the mu receptor. Mutagenesis studies revealed that morphine interacts differently with the mu receptor to activate it than do the fentanyl analogs which may explain its lack of desensitization of the mu receptor.

Fentanyl depresses central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory function. Exposure to fentanyl may be fatal. Fentanyl is estimated to be 80 times as potent as morphine and hundreds of times more potent than heroin. It is a drug of abuse. Fentanyl (and other opioids) could possibly be used as an incapacitating agent to impair a person’s ability to function. In October 2002, the Russian military reportedly used “a fentanyl derivative” against terrorists holding hostages in a Moscow theater; 127 of the hostages died. (It is unclear whether the gas used also included other chemical agent(s).) Fentanyl is odorless.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears in the “Uses” and “Environmental Exposure” portions of the fentanyl profile, where it first quantifies estimated per-capita consumption (Germany 0.00122 g, USA 0.000564 g) and a 49.6 % removal rate (DOI:10.1021/acs.est.5b03332), then transitions into the core pharmacological summary: fentanyl is an odorless, rapid-acting synthetic opioid analgesic—≈80× more potent than morphine and hundreds of times more potent than heroin—that depresses CNS and respiratory function, carries high abuse and incapacitant potential, and was implicated in the 2002 Moscow theater incident.\n                "}

Bethesda, MD. 2017, p. 2248\n\nThere have been two new alerts issued related to synthetic opioids. The Gulf Coast High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area has issued an alert for a substance with the street name \"Grey Death.\" The substance appears similar to concrete mixing powder and varies in texture, which ranges from a chunky rock-like material to a fine powder. It is not a single drug, but typically contains several potent opioids, including whatever a drug dealer has on hand in varying proportions. It has a potency much higher than heroin and is reportedly administered via injection, ingestion, insufflation, and smoking. The analysis of each grey death sample collected in the gulf coast region so far revealed the presence of three opioids: U-47700, heroin, and fentanyl; though the amount of each drug within grey death varied from sample to sample.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from the “Formulations/Preparations” subsection (under Use and Manufacturing) of the PubChem Fentanyl record, listing the C-II sublingual tablet Abstral (Galena) and reporting recent Gulf Coast alerts on illicit fentanyl-based mixtures (“Grey Death”).\n                "}

Competitive ionization studies highlight that detection of these compounds in the presence of heroin is readily achievable, down to 0.1% fentanyl by mass with TD-DART-MS.

This test allows detection of alfentanil in blood and urine of horses for up to 4 hr after administration of this drug. As such, these tests are capable of improving the quality and reducing the cost of prerace and postrace testing for fentanyl, sufentanil, carfentanil, and alfentanil and a number of their congeners in racing horses. Similarly, these tests are capable of screening for these drugs in human drug abuse monitoring.\n\nPMID:2521746\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Clinical Laboratory Methods (Section 10.2): An excerpt from the Merck Index (2013, p. 734) and PMID 2521746 describing ELISA and RIA immunoassays for detecting fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, and carfentanil in horse blood and urine—methods applicable to equine doping control and human drug-abuse monitoring.\n                "}

Various methods of administration exist including the transdermal patch system, widely used in chronic pain and palliative care settings. Numerous, often imaginative methods of abuse of fentanyl patches have been reported, the majority of fatal fentanyl overdose cases resulting from deliberate abuse or suicide.

The Henry's Law constant for fentanyl is estimated as 9.8X10-12 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 4.43X10-9 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 200 mg/L(3). This Henry's Law constant indicates that the neutral form of fentanyl is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water and moist soil surfaces(4). Fentanyl is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(2).\n\n(1) Boleda MR et al; Chemosphere 84: 1601-7 (2011)\n\n(2) Gupta PK et al; J Chem Eng Data 53: 841-5 (2008)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt comes from Section 12.2.7 “Volatilization from Water / Soil” in the Environmental Fate chapter (12.2) of the Fentanyl profile.
