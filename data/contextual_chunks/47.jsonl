It is an analgesic which is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including postoperative pain and labour pain. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and an antispasmodic drug. It is an ethyl ester, a piperidinecarboxylate ester and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a pethidine(1+).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is the top-of-page “Compound Summary” box for Meperidine (PubChem CID 4058), presenting its core chemical identity (molecular formula C₁₅H₂₁NO₂; MW 247.33 g/mol), safety classifications (acute toxic, irritant, health hazard), structure images, key synonyms (e.g., Pethidine, Isonipecaine), creation/modification dates, and a brief functional description as a 1-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxylate ethyl ester opioid analgesic.\n                "}

Meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than equivalent doses of morphine. The onset of action is lightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. The chemical structure of meperidine is similar to local anesthetics. Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    From Section 8.1 (Pharmacodynamics) of the PubChem Meperidine (Pethidine) entry—citing Martindale—this passage characterizes meperidine as a synthetic phenylpiperidine opioid agonist with rapid onset and shorter duration than morphine, a local‐anesthetic–like structure, and uses in acute pain relief, postoperative shivering, and regional anesthesia.\n                "}

Hence, hCE-1 in human liver microsomes may play an important role in meperidine elimination. Propoxyphene was not hydrolyzed by hCE-1 or hCE-2. This observation is consistent with the absence of a major hydrolytic pathway for propoxyphene metabolism in humans.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpted from the “Metabolism / Metabolites” section of the Meperidine entry, this passage explains that human liver carboxylesterase‐1 (hCE-1) hydrolyzes meperidine to meperidinic acid and ethanol—highlighting hCE-1’s key role in meperidine elimination—while neither hCE-1 nor hCE-2 hydrolyzes propoxyphene, consistent with propoxyphene’s lack of a major hydrolytic pathway in humans.\n                "}

It is used in the management of moderate to several pain. A possible hydrolytic degradation of an ester group can generate a very toxic compound, the N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) which contaminates the drug. Because of the toxicity of MPTP a suitable method for its determination must be selective and sensitive. Afterwards we propose simple methods to determine pethidine and MPTP by capillary electrophoresis (CE), MECK and RP-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) looking at the limit of detection obtained using these three techniques. CE was carried out using as running buffer ammonium acetate (pH 8.3). MECK was performed with a borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing sodium dodecylsulfate and trimethyl-beta-cyclodextrins.

Meperidine is a strong analgesic used in the relief of moderate to severe pain. The drug has been used to relieve the pain of myocardial infarction. Meperidine also is used parenterally for preoperative sedation, as a supplement to anesthesia, and to provide analgesia during labor. HUMAN STUDIES: Meperidine is a mu- and kappa-opiate receptor agonist with approximately 20-25% the potency of morphine. Receptors for opiate analgesics are found in high concentrations in the limbic system, spinal cord, thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum, and midbrain. They are also found in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, urinary track, and in other smooth muscle. Meperidine is different from other opioids because its active metabolite, normeperidine, is neurotoxic. The lethal meperidine blood concentration is 1-3 mg/dL. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting and hypotension. Meperidine can produce further hypotension in patients who have blood\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    Excerpt from the Toxicity section (12.1.1 Toxicity Summary), summarizing meperidine’s physical form, clinical analgesic uses, opioid receptor activity and relative potency, the neurotoxic normeperidine metabolite, lethal blood concentrations, and common adverse effects.\n                "}

Meperidine can produce further hypotension in patients who have blood loss due to trauma. In high doses, it has been associated with seizure. Obstetric analgesia in the form of meperidine to mothers during delivery has adverse effects on some aspects of the behavior of their newborn infants. ANIMAL STUDIES: In mice a reversible opacity of the front of the lens has been observed to develop acutely after systematic administration of meperidine, because of reduced blinking, exposing the eye to evaporation and causing dehydration of the lens. Meperidine is reported to inhibit the release of gonadotropins in animals. Prolonged administration of up to 6 times the recommended therapeutic dose to dogs produces slight anorexia and loss of weight.

Gastric lavage can be considered to remove stomach contents, and laxatives may be used to induce defecation, facilitating further elimination of the drug. Hemodialysis may enhance the clearance of both pethidine and its metabolite, normeperidine. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is the primary treatment for reversing opioid-induced effects.

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited.

The risk of respiratory depression increased with age. Compared with patients aged between 16 and 45 years, those aged between 61 and 70 years had 2.8 times the risk of development of respiratory depression (95% CI, 1.2-6.6); those aged between 71 and 80 years had 5.4 times the risk (95% CI, 2.4-11.8); and those aged older than 80 years had 8.7 times the risk (95% CI, 3.8-20.0). Men had less nausea and vomiting than women (OR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.6). White subjects had more nausea and vomiting than black subjects (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7). Meperidine produced fewer side effects than morphine during short-term use. The risk of respiratory depression increases substantially after 60 years of age. Women have nausea and vomiting more often than men. The effect of race deserves further investigation.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    In the document’s toxicology section under “Populations at Special Risk,” a large retrospective cohort study (n=8,855) comparing short‐term use of meperidine, morphine, and fentanyl found that meperidine was associated with significantly lower odds of nausea/vomiting (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5–0.8) and respiratory depression (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.2–0.9) than morphine. The risk of respiratory depression rose sharply with age—2.8-fold for ages 61–70, 5.4-fold for 71–80, and 8.7-fold for >80—and men experienced less nausea/vomiting than women (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.4–0.6), while white subjects had more GI side effects than black subjects (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1–1.7).\n                "}
