It is a first-generation H1 antihistamine that is widely used as a generic, over-the-counter medication to treat allergies. When exceeding approved doses, diphenhydramine produces powerful deliriant effects.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This introductory section provides a summary and safety warning about diphenhydramine, emphasizing its classification as a deliriant and highlighting the high likelihood of uncomfortable or dangerous experiences when used recreationally. It urges harm reduction practices and introduces diphenhydramine's typical medical use and effects at higher doses. This sets the stage for the detailed sections that follow, which cover diphenhydramine's effects, chemistry, pharmacology, subjective experiences, history, legal status, and harm potential.\n                "}
