Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that mentions heroin overdose. The task is to detect any drug-related references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I need to look for any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs. The post says "died of a heroin overdose." Heroin is a well-known opioid. Checking the index terms, there's an entry for Morphine, which includes aliases like "MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph." But heroin isn't directly listed. Wait, the index terms include "Heroin (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)"? Wait, no, looking back, the index terms list "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" but not heroin. However, the user's example includes "Codeine" for "lean" and "codeine." So maybe heroin isn't directly listed. But in the index terms, there's a list for "Morphine," but heroin is a different drug. However, the index terms don't have a specific entry for heroin. Wait, looking again, the index terms include "Morphine" but not heroin. But in the example, "Codeine" is linked to "lean" and "codeine." So if the post mentions "heroin," I need to check if there's an index term for heroin. But according to the provided list, heroin isn't explicitly listed. Wait, the index terms list "Morphine" but not heroin. However, heroin is a different drug. But in the example, "Codeine" is mapped to "lean" and "codeine." So if the post mentions "heroin," which isn't in the index terms, then the index term would be "other." Wait, but the user's example 1 has "lean" and "codeine" both mapped to Codeine. So in this case, the post mentions "heroin overdose." Since heroin isn't in the index terms, the index term would be "other." But wait, the index terms list "Morphine" but not heroin. However, heroin is a different drug. So the correct index term here would be "other" because heroin isn't listed. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the index terms again. The index terms include "Morphine" but not heroin. So "heroin" is not in the list, so the index term should be "other." Therefore, the matched phrase is "heroin," and the index term is "other." But wait, the user's example 4 mentions "snow" and "white lines" as other. So in this case, the post has "heroin," which is not in the index terms, so it's "other." So the JSON array would have one entry with index_term "other" and matched_phrase "heroin." But wait, the user's example 1 has "lean" and "codeine" both mapped to Codeine. So in this case, "heroin" is not in the list, so it's "other." Therefore, the answer is [{"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "heroin"}].
