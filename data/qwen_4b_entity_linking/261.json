Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a social media post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The post mentions "DNA Jimin and Tae" and compares it to "drinking crack laced coke back in the day." The key phrase here is "drinking crack laced coke." 

Now, I need to check if "crack" and "coke" are in the index terms. Looking at the list, "Codeine" has synonyms like "Lean," "Purple Drank," and "Schoolboy." But "crack" isn't listed. Wait, "crack" is a slang for cocaine, which is a drug. However, in the index terms, "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" is the metabolite of cocaine. But the index term for cocaine itself isn't listed. The index terms include "Cocaine" as a separate entry? Wait, no, looking back, the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine. The only related term is Benzoylecgonine, which is a metabolite. So if the post mentions "coke," which is slang for cocaine, but since cocaine isn't in the index terms, I should map it to "other." 

But wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" mapped to "other" because they weren't drugs. So in this case, "crack" and "coke" are drugs, but if they aren't in the index terms, they should be "other." However, I need to check if "crack" is in the index terms. Let me check again. The index terms include "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" but that's for amphetamine. Wait no, looking at the list, "Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" is one entry. Then "Cocaine" isn't listed as an index term. The only related term is Benzoylecgonine, which is a metabolite. Therefore, "crack" and "coke" are not in the index terms, so they should be "other."

But wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" which is not in the list, so it's "other." Similarly, "crack" and "coke" here would be "other." However, the user might have intended "crack" as a reference to cocaine, but since cocaine isn't in the index terms, it's "other." So the matched phrases are "crack" and "coke," both mapped to "other." 

So the JSON array would have two entries: "crack" and "coke" as "other." But wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as "other," even though "snow" is a slang for cocaine. But in that example, the user said "snow" is not in the list, so it's "other." So in this case, "crack" and "coke" are not in the index terms, so they are "other." Therefore, the answer should be two entries with "other" and the phrases "crack" and "coke."
