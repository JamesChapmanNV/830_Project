Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Then: Big gay bear artist. Now:Big gay bear artist + legal drug dealer". I need to check for any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look for any slang, euphemisms, or terms that might refer to illicit drugs. The first part is "Big gay bear artist" which seems like a description of a person, maybe a nickname or a metaphor. The second part adds "legal drug dealer". Wait, "legal drug dealer" is a bit tricky. The term "legal" here might be a red herring, but the key part is "drug dealer". However, the index terms list includes specific drugs and their synonyms. 

Looking at the index terms, "legal drug dealer" isn't listed as a specific drug. The term "dealer" might be part of a phrase, but the actual drug names are in the list. The post doesn't mention any specific drug names like codeine, amphetamine, etc. The only possible mention is "legal drug dealer", but since "legal" is specified, maybe it's not an illicit drug. However, the task is to detect any references to illicit drugs, even if the term is part of a phrase. But according to the index terms, "legal drug dealer" isn't a listed term. 

Wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" which was "other" because it wasn't a specific drug. Similarly, "legal drug dealer" isn't a drug name in the list. So the matched phrase would be "legal drug dealer" but since it's not in the index terms, it should be "other". But the post says "legal drug dealer", which is a person, not a drug. However, the task is to detect any references to drugs, not people. So maybe there's no drug reference here. 

Wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as "other" because they weren't drugs. So in this case, "legal drug dealer" is a person, not a drug. Therefore, there are no drug references in the post. So the JSON array should be empty. But wait, the user's instruction says to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. Since "legal drug dealer" is a person, not a drug, it's not a match. Therefore, there are no matches here. So the output should be an empty array.
