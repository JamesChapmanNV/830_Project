Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Sask. Health Authority encourages companies to bring in drug-overdose training". My task is to detect any drug-related references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The main subject here is the Sask. Health Authority encouraging companies to provide drug-overdose training. The key phrase here is "drug-overdose training". Now, I need to check if "drug-overdose" refers to a specific illicit drug or substance listed in the index terms.

Looking at the index terms, there's a list of various drugs and their synonyms. However, "drug-overdose" isn't a specific drug name but a general term referring to overdose incidents. The index terms are specific to substances like codeine, amphetamine, fentanyl, etc. Since "drug-overdose" isn't a direct synonym for any of the listed index terms, it's likely categorized under "other".

Wait, but maybe "drug-overdose" could be linked to a specific drug if it's a euphemism. However, in this context, it's more about training related to overdose prevention rather than referencing a specific drug. The post doesn't mention any specific drug names or slang. The only possible term is "drug-overdose", which isn't listed in the index terms. Therefore, the correct index term here would be "other".

So, the matched phrase is "drug-overdose training", but since "drug-overdose" isn't a specific substance, it's classified as "other". The JSON should have one object with index_term "other" and matched_phrase "drug-overdose training".
