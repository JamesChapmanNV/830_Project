Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I need to look at the post: "lol you're the one who said they don't crack 20 likes and you brought it up, not me üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è". The main words here are "crack" and "likes". 

Looking at the index terms, "crack" isn't listed as a direct term. The index terms include things like Codeine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, etc. "Crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is a form of cocaine. However, in the provided index terms, the only cocaine-related term is Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate), which is the metabolite of cocaine. But the user's task is to check if the phrase matches any index term. Since "crack" isn't explicitly listed, but "crack" is a slang for cocaine, which is a drug. However, the index terms don't have a direct entry for "crack" as a drug. 

Wait, the index terms include "Cocaine (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" but that's incorrect. Wait, no, looking back, the index terms list "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" as the most widely used illicit drug. Then "Cocaine (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" is not there. Wait, no, the index terms for cocaine are under "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite. But the actual drug is cocaine. However, the index terms don't have a direct entry for "Cocaine" as a term. Wait, looking back, the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the primary metabolite of cocaine. So, if the post mentions "crack", which is a form of cocaine, but the index terms don't have "Cocaine" as an index term. Therefore, "crack" would fall under "other" because it's not listed. 

But wait, the user's task says to check if the drug is in the list. Since "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is not listed (the index term for cocaine is Benzoylecgonine, which is a metabolite, not the drug itself). Therefore, "crack" is not in the index terms. So the matched phrase "crack" would be "other". 

But wait, the example in the user's prompt: in example 4, "snow" and "white lines" are considered "other" because they aren't drugs. So in this case, "crack" is a drug, but since it's not in the index terms, it's "other". However, maybe "crack" is considered a drug, but the index terms don't have it. Therefore, the answer should be "other" for "crack".

But wait, the index terms include "Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" and "Methamphetamine (Crystal Meth, Ice, Desoxyn)", so "crack" is a different drug. The index terms don't have "crack" as a term, so it's "other". 

So the post has "crack" which is a drug, but not in the index terms. Therefore, the matched phrase is "crack" with index_term "other". 

But wait, the user's example 3 has "xans" which is not in the index terms, so it's "other". Similarly, "crack" here would be "other". 

So the output should be [{"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "crack"}].
