Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "If playing football was drugs i would hv been taking overdose" and wants me to detect any drug-related references.

First, I need to go through the post and check for any words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs, slang, or euphemisms. The post is a bit abstract, using "if playing football was drugs" as a metaphor. The key part here is "drugs" itself. But wait, the task is to detect specific terms from the index list. 

Looking at the index terms, "drugs" isn't listed as a specific term. The example in the problem shows that "xans" was categorized as "other" because it's not a specific drug. So, in this case, the word "drugs" is a general term and not a specific index term. Therefore, it should be classified under "other". 

The user also mentioned "overdose" in the post. But "overdose" is a general term and not a specific drug. The index terms include specific drugs like fentanyl, codeine, etc., but not the word "overdose". So, "overdose" would also be "other".

So the matched phrases here are "drugs" and "overdose", both of which are general terms not found in the index list. Therefore, both should be categorized as "other".
