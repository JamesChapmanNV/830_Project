Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "#EUPHORIA nahhh ion trust how she pulled that morphine out". I need to detect any drug references here.

First, I'll look for keywords that might refer to illicit drugs. The hashtag #EUPHORIA could be a slang term, but I'm not sure. The phrase "ion trust" might be a typo or slang. Then "morphine" is directly mentioned. Checking the index terms, Morphine is listed as an index term. So "morphine" would map to "Morphine". 

Now, "ion trust" – maybe "ion" is a typo for "I don't"? But that's speculative. Alternatively, "ion" could be a slang term, but it's not in the index terms. The example in the prompt had "xans" mapped to "other" because it wasn't listed. So if "ion" isn't a known drug term, it would be "other". But the user's post says "ion trust", which might be "I don't trust". However, the exact phrase "ion" isn't in the index terms. So "ion" would be "other". But the main drug here is "morphine", which is in the list. 

Wait, the user's post is: "#EUPHORIA nahhh ion trust how she pulled that morphine out". The key phrase here is "morphine", which is directly listed under the index terms. So that's one match. The rest of the text: "#EUPHORIA" is a hashtag, but not a drug term. "nahhh" is an exclamation, not a drug. "ion trust" – "ion" might be a typo for "I don't", but even if it's a typo, it's not a drug. So the only match is "morphine". 

So the JSON should have one entry: {"index_term": "Morphine", "matched_phrase": "morphine"}.
