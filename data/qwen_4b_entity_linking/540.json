Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that needs to be moderated for drug-related references. The task is to detect any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs, link them to the appropriate index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The post says: "cuntER is just advertising Pedo joe's     aka 10% for the big guy FREE CRACK PIPES seeing he will be Joes biggest customer. PS see below. This is the smartest man joe knows."

Looking for drug-related terms. The first part mentions "Pedo joe's" which might be a slang term, but I need to check the index terms. "Pedo" isn't listed, but "joe" could be a nickname. Then there's "FREE CRACK PIPES". "Crack" is a term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. "Crack pipes" would be the equipment used to process crack cocaine. 

Checking the index terms, "Crack" isn't directly listed, but "Cocaine" is. However, the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the primary metabolite of cocaine. Since "crack" is a form of cocaine, it's likely that "crack" here refers to cocaine. But wait, the index terms don't have "crack" as a direct term. Let me check again. The index terms include "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" but that's for amphetamine. Wait, no, the index terms for cocaine are "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite. However, "crack" is a form of cocaine, so maybe "crack" is considered under the broader category of cocaine. But the index terms don't have "crack" as a separate term. 

Looking at the example where "snow" was considered "other" because it's not a drug. So if "crack" isn't listed in the index terms, then it would be "other". But wait, the index terms do have "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" but that's for amphetamine. Wait, no, looking back, the index terms for Amphetamine are listed as "Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)". Then "Cocaine" is listed as "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite. So "crack" is a form of cocaine, but since the index terms don't have "crack" as a direct term, it would be "other". 

But wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" as "other" because it's not a drug. So "crack" here is a drug, but if it's not in the index terms, then it's "other". However, the index terms list "Cocaine" as the metabolite, so maybe "crack" is considered under "Cocaine"? But the index terms don't have "crack" as a separate entry. 

Alternatively, maybe "crack pipes" is referring to the equipment used to process crack cocaine, which is a drug. But the index terms don't have "crack" as a term, so the matched phrase would be "crack" with index term "other". 

So in the post, "FREE CRACK PIPES" would be "crack" as the matched phrase, and the index term would be "other" because "crack" isn't listed in the index terms. However, the index terms do include "Cocaine" as the metabolite, but the term "crack" is a form of cocaine. But since the index terms don't have "crack" as a direct term, it's better to use "other". 

Therefore, the detected phrases are "crack" and "pipes". But "pipes" is not a drug term. Wait, "crack pipes" is the equipment, but the term "crack" refers to the drug. So the matched phrase is "crack", and the index term is "other" because "crack" isn't listed in the index terms. 

So the JSON array would have one entry: {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "crack"}.
