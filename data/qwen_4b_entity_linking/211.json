Okay, let's see. The user provided a post that says "Overdose #9ToEternityWithEXO #9YearswithEXO #EXO". I need to check if there are any drug-related references here.

First, the main text is "Overdose". The term "overdose" is a common term associated with drug use, but I need to check if it's listed in the index terms. Looking through the list, I don't see "overdose" as an index term. The index terms are specific to drugs like codeine, amphetamine, fentanyl, etc. "Overdose" is more of a consequence rather than a specific drug or substance. 

Then there are the hashtags: #9ToEternityWithEXO, #9YearswithEXO, #EXO. These are all related to the K-pop group EXO. There's no mention of any drugs here. The hashtags are just references to the group and their fan culture. 

So, the only possible mention is "Overdose", but since it's not in the index terms, it should be categorized as "other". However, I need to make sure. Let me double-check the index terms again. The list includes terms like "Codeine", "Amphetamine", "Fentanyl", "Methamphetamine", etc., but not "overdose". 

Therefore, the matched phrase "Overdose" would map to "other" because it's not a specific drug or substance listed in the index terms. The hashtags are unrelated. So the JSON array should have one entry with "other" and "Overdose".
