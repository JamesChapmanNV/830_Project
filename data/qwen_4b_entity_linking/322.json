Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post in Hindi: "50 Kg Heroin, Rs 30 Lakh Cash Seized From Delhi's Shaheen Bagh". The task is to detect any drug-related references and map them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I need to look for any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs. The post mentions "Heroin" and "Cash". Heroin is a well-known opioid, so I check the index terms. Looking through the list, "Heroin (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" is listed. So "Heroin" maps directly to that index term.

Next, "Cash" is mentioned. But cash itself isn't a drug. The index terms don't have a category for currency, so according to the instructions, if it's not a drug, it should be "other". However, in this context, "cash" might be part of the transaction involving drugs. But the task is to detect drug references. Since "cash" isn't a drug, it's "other". 

Wait, but the example in the user's prompt had "snow" and "white lines" as "other" even though they might be slang. So in this case, "cash" is not a drug, so it's "other". 

So the matched phrases are "Heroin" and "Cash". "Heroin" maps to the index term for heroin, and "Cash" is "other". 

But wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other. So "cash" here would also be "other". 

Therefore, the JSON array should have two entries: one for "Heroin" and one for "Cash" as "other".
