Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array. 

First, I need to read the post carefully: "What a stupid tweet, the Pels were 3-0 against the Lakers this year and your sorry squad didn't crack the playoffs..." 

Looking for any words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The post is talking about sports teams, the Pelicans vs. Lakers, and playoff performance. The words here are "Pels," "Lakers," "playoffs," "squad," etc. 

Now, checking the index terms list. The index terms include drugs like Codeine, Amphetamine, Benzodiazepines, etc. But in this post, there's no mention of any drug names, slang, or euphemisms. The mention of "Pels" is a team name, "Lakers" is another team, and "playoffs" is a sports term. 

I need to make sure there's no hidden reference. For example, "squad" could be a slang term, but in this context, it's referring to a sports team. "Playoffs" is part of the sports terminology. There's no mention of any drugs here. 

Since none of the words in the post match any of the index terms, each detected phrase would fall under "other." But wait, the task says to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. Since there are none here, the array should be empty. 

But the example 3 shows that if a phrase isn't a drug, it's marked as "other." However, in this case, there are no drug-related phrases. So the correct response is an empty array. 

Wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" which wasn't a drug, so it was "other." But here, there are no drug references. Therefore, the JSON array should be empty. 

So the final answer is an empty array. Let me confirm again. The post is entirely about sports teams and playoffs. No drug terms. So the correct output is an empty list.
