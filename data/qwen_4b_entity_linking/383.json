Okay, let's see. The user provided a post about Ukraine and political issues. My task is to check for any drug-related references and map them to the index terms. First, I'll read through the post carefully.

The post mentions "#Ukraine â€” no end in sight for what turns out to be a proxy war between Putin & #Biden. Economic woes could crack Biden's coalition. With approval ratings below 40% months before the midterms, can he find the fiscal room & political will to fortify Europe?"

Looking at the text, there's a lot of political and economic discussion. I need to check if any words or phrases here refer to illicit drugs. The hashtags are #Ukraine and #Biden, which are political. The terms like "proxy war," "economic woes," "approval ratings," "fiscal room," "political will" are all related to politics and economics, not drugs. 

I should check if any slang or euphemisms for drugs are present. Words like "proxy war" might be a stretch, but it's not a drug term. "Economic woes" is about economy. "Fiscal room" is financial. There's no mention of any substances, drugs, or related terms here. 

The example given in the problem had "lean" and "codeine" linked to Codeine. But in this post, there's nothing like that. The user might be testing if I can recognize that there are no drug references here. 

So, the answer should be an empty array since there are no detected phrases. But wait, the example 3 had "xans" which wasn't on the list, so it was "other". But in this case, there are no drug-related terms. Therefore, the JSON array should be empty.
