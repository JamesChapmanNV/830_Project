Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that needs to be checked for drug-related references. The task is to detect any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs, link them to the correct index term, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read the post carefully: "the morphine shot was cool but all bc we can't see zendaya tittes IM CRYINGGGG #Euphoria". 

Looking for drug-related terms. The first part mentions "morphine shot". Morphine is listed in the index terms under "Morphine" as the prototypical opioid analgesic. So "morphine" would map to "Morphine".

Next, the rest of the post: "but all bc we can't see zendaya tittes IM CRYINGGGG #Euphoria". There's no direct drug reference here. "Zendaya tittes" is a reference to a celebrity, and "#Euphoria" is a hashtag related to a TV show. The user might be using "euphoria" as a slang term, but checking the index terms, "euphoria" isn't listed. However, "Amphetamine" is listed with synonyms like "Speed, Bennies, Adderall", but "euphoria" isn't directly linked. Wait, the example 2 had "addy" mapped to Amphetamine. But in this case, "euphoria" isn't a direct synonym for any drug in the list. The hashtag #Euphoria is just a reference to the show, not a drug term. 

So the only drug reference here is "morphine shot", which maps to "Morphine". The rest of the text doesn't contain any other drug-related terms. The user might be trying to use "euphoria" as a slang term, but since it's not in the index terms, it would be "other". However, in the post, "euphoria" is part of a hashtag and not a direct reference to a drug. The user is crying about not seeing Zendaya's tittes, which is unrelated to drugs. 

Therefore, the only matched phrase is "morphine shot" under "Morphine". The rest of the text doesn't have any drug references. The hashtag #Euphoria is not a drug term, so it's "other" but since it's not a direct drug reference, maybe it's not included. Wait, the task is to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. The hashtag is not a drug term. So the only match is "morphine shot" which is "Morphine".
