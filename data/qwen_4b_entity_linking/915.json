Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about football, specifically mentioning players Pickens and Watson. The task is to detect any drug-related references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I'll read through the post again to make sure I don't miss anything. The post talks about a player's performance, his blocking, and his potential draft pick. The mention of "run blocking" is a sports term, not related to drugs. The names "Pickens" and "Watson" are likely player names, not drug slang. 

I need to check if any of the words or phrases are slang for drugs. Let me go through the list of index terms again. The terms include things like Codeine, Amphetamine, Benzodiazepines, Opioids, etc. Words like "lean" are associated with Codeine, but "lean" here is part of a sentence about a player's performance. "Watson" isn't a drug term. 

Looking for any possible euphemisms or synonyms. The post doesn't mention any substances, drugs, or related terms. The words "run blocking" are sports terminology. There's no mention of anything like "codeine," "amphetamine," "heroin," or other drugs listed. 

Since there are no drug-related terms in the post, all detected phrases would be "other." But the example in the prompt shows that if there's no match, it's "other." However, the user's example 3 had "xans" which wasn't a drug term, so it was "other." 

In this case, the post is entirely about sports and doesn't contain any drug references. Therefore, there are no matches to report. The JSON array should be empty. Wait, but the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as "other." But in this case, the post doesn't have any words that are drug-related. So the correct response is an empty array. 

But the user's instruction says to return only the valid JSON array with matches. If there are no matches, then the array is empty. Let me confirm that. The example 3 had "xans" which was "other," but in this case, there are no such terms. So the answer should be an empty array.
