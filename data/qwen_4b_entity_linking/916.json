Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Need this Wolves/Grizz series to go 7. This has been very entertaining bad basketball." I need to check for any drug-related references here.

First, I'll go through the post word by word. The first part is "Need this Wolves/Grizz series to go 7." Wolves and Grizz are basketball teams, so that's just sports terminology. "To go 7" refers to a best-of-7 series in sports, which is unrelated to drugs.

Next sentence: "This has been very entertaining bad basketball." Again, "bad basketball" is a colloquial way to describe poor play, not a drug reference. The words "entertaining" and "bad" are adjectives here, not slang for drugs. 

Looking at the list of index terms, I need to make sure none of the phrases here match any drug names or slang. The post doesn't mention any substances like codeine, amphetamine, cocaine, etc. The only possible terms are "Wolves/Grizz" which are team names, and "bad basketball" which is a sports term. 

Since there are no drug-related terms in the post, all detected phrases should be marked as "other". But wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" which wasn't in the list, so it was "other". Similarly, in example 4, "snow" and "white lines" were "other". 

In this case, the post doesn't contain any phrases that refer to illicit drugs. The words "Wolves/Grizz" are team names, and "bad basketball" is a description of the game. There's no slang or euphemism here. Therefore, the correct response is to return an empty array or mark all phrases as "other" if there's a match. But since there are no matches, the JSON array should be empty. However, the user's example 3 had "xans" which was "other", but in that case, there was a match. Wait, in example 3, the post was "Popped two xans before class." and "xans" wasn't in the list, so it was "other". But in this case, the post has no drug references. So the correct answer is an empty array. But the user's examples show that even if there's no match, the JSON array is empty. So the answer here should be an empty array.
