Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about Anthony Durante, a wrestler, who had an accidental overdose on oxycodone or fentanyl in 2003. My task is to detect any drug-related references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I need to look at the post: "Anthony Durante, a professional wrestler, experienced an accidental oxycodone or fentanyl overdose in 2003 at age 36." The key words here are "oxycodone" and "fentanyl." 

Looking at the index terms list, I see that Oxycodone is listed under "Oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet, Hillbilly Heroin)" as a semi-synthetic opioid. Fentanyl is listed under "Fentanyl (China White, Apache, Duragesic)" as a synthetic opioid 50â€“100 times stronger than morphine. Both are explicitly mentioned in the index terms, so they should be matched directly.

The post uses "oxycodone" and "fentanyl" as the drugs involved. The phrase "oxycodone or fentanyl" is the exact text, so each should be a separate entry. Since both are in the index terms, there's no need to use "other." 

I need to make sure there are no other phrases. The rest of the post doesn't mention any other drugs. The words "overdose" are part of the context but not a drug name. So the JSON array should have two entries: one for oxycodone and one for fentanyl.
