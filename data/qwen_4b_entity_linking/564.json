Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "How the Legalization of Cannabis Will Impact Thailand CBD Relief Authority News -". I need to check for any drug-related references here.

First, I'll scan the post for keywords. The main terms are "Cannabis", "CBD", "Legalization", "Thailand", "Relief Authority", "News". 

Looking at the index terms, "Marijuana" is listed as a term for cannabis. The post mentions "Cannabis", which is the same as "Marijuana" in the index. So "Cannabis" should map to "Marijuana".

Next, "CBD" is explicitly listed as an index term. The post has "CBD", so that's a direct match. 

The rest of the text is about legalization, Thailand, and a news authority. None of those terms are drug-related references. The words "Relief Authority" might be a stretch, but since it's part of the title, it's likely a proper noun related to the news outlet, not a drug term. 

So the detected phrases are "Cannabis" and "CBD". Mapping them to the index terms: "Marijuana" and "CBD". 

I need to make sure there's no other slang or euphemism. The post doesn't use any other terms. So the JSON should have two entries: one for "Marijuana" with "Cannabis" and another for "CBD" with "CBD".
