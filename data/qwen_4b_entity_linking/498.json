Okay, let's see. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references. The task is to find every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug or substance, link them to the correct Index Term, and return a JSON array.

First, I need to read through the post carefully. The post says: "I'd wager the US is backfilling them? Keeping Putin's regime at bay and saving democracy for Ukraine is worth every penny IMO. When Ukraine defeats Putin's army, the world will owe them more than we gave them because they had to pay with blood ðŸ˜”"

Looking at this, the main content is about political statements regarding the US, Putin, Ukraine, and the costs of war. There's no direct mention of drugs or substances here. The user is talking about geopolitical issues, not drug use or related terms. 

I should check if there are any slang terms, euphemisms, or cultural references that might indirectly relate to drugs. Words like "backfilling" might be a stretch, but it's more likely a political term. The mention of "blood" is metaphorical, referring to the cost of war, not a drug. 

Looking at the Index Terms list, none of the terms here match any drug names or slang. The post doesn't include any phrases like "codeine," "amphetamine," "heroin," or other drugs listed. The only possible mention is "backfilling," but that's not in the Index Terms. 

Since there are no drug-related phrases detected, the correct response would be to list "other" for any matched phrases. However, since there are no actual drug references, the JSON array should be empty. Wait, but the examples show that even if there's no match, you have to list "other" for each detected phrase. But in this case, there are no detected phrases. 

Wait, the task says to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. If none are found, then the array is empty. But according to the examples, if there's no match, the output would be empty. For example, in Example 3, "xans" is not a drug term, so it's "other", but the user's post here has no such terms. 

So the correct answer is an empty array. But the user's instructions say to return only the JSON array. So the output should be an empty list. However, the examples show that when there are matches, they are listed. If there are no matches, the array is empty. 

Therefore, the final answer is an empty JSON array.
