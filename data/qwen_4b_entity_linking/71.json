Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read through the post carefully: "yup, they either don't pay enough, don't offer enough hours, don't provide health care, or like you said, they don't respond back ðŸ˜¤. like damn, is crack selling season? cause I might need to start serving ðŸ˜‚"

Looking for any mentions of drugs or related terms. The first part talks about workplace issues, which doesn't seem drug-related. The second part has "crack selling season" and "start serving". 

Now, checking the index terms. "Crack" is a form of cocaine, which is listed under "other" because cocaine's index term is Benzoylecgonine (BZE), but the user's example 4 shows that if the drug isn't in the list, use "other". Wait, looking at the index terms, cocaine is listed as Benzoylecgonine. But the post mentions "crack", which is a form of cocaine. However, in the index terms, cocaine is under Benzoylecgonine, but "crack" isn't explicitly listed. Wait, the index terms list "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" for Amphetamine, but that's a mistake. Wait no, looking back: the index terms list Amphetamine as "Speed, Bennies, Adderall", but cocaine is listed as Benzoylecgonine. However, "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is Benzoylecgonine. However, in the example 4, "snow" and "white lines" are considered "other" even though they might refer to cocaine (like "white lines" could be crack). But in this case, the user's post says "crack selling season". Since "crack" is a type of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is Benzoylecgonine. Wait, but in the index terms, "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" is listed under Amphetamine? Wait no, looking back: the index terms list "Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" and then "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as cocaine. So "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is Benzoylecgonine. However, the post uses "crack", which is a slang term for cocaine. But in the index terms, is "crack" listed? Let me check again. The index terms don't have "crack" as a separate entry. The only cocaine-related term is Benzoylecgonine. Therefore, "crack" would not be directly listed, so it would fall under "other". However, the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as "other", even though they might refer to cocaine. So in this case, "crack" is a drug, but since it's not explicitly in the index terms, it would be "other". 

Wait, but the index term for cocaine is Benzoylecgonine. The post says "crack", which is a form of cocaine. However, the index terms don't list "crack" as an index term. Therefore, "crack" would be under "other". But maybe the user considers "crack" as a drug, so even though it's not in the index terms, it's still a drug. But according to the task, if the drug is not in the list, use "other". Therefore, "crack" would be "other".

So the matched phrase is "crack", index term "other". The other part is "selling season", which is not a drug term. "Start serving" could be slang, but not a drug. So the only match is "crack", which is "other".
