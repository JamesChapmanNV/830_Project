Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Why you pouring all that codeine in that Sprite, Why ❓" and wants me to detect any drug references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I need to look for any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs. The post mentions "codeine" directly. Checking the index terms, Codeine is listed with synonyms like Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy. The phrase "codeine" is explicitly in the post, so that's a clear match. The other part is "Sprite"—but that's a drink, not a drug. The user might be referring to adding codeine to Sprite, which is a slang way of saying using codeine. Since "codeine" is in the index terms, the matched phrase is "codeine" and the index term is Codeine. There's no other drug mentioned here. So the JSON should have one object with index_term "Codeine" and matched_phrase "codeine".
