Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Please tell your drug dealer I said hie". I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look for words or phrases that could be slang, euphemisms, or synonyms for illicit drugs. The word "hie" stands out. Hmm, "hie" isn't a drug term I recognize immediately. But wait, in some contexts, "hie" might be a slang term. Let me check the index terms provided.

Looking through the list, the index terms include "Codeine" with synonyms like "Lean", "Purple Drank", "Schoolboy". But "hie" isn't listed there. Wait, maybe "hie" is a misspelling or a variant of another term? Alternatively, could "hie" be a slang for a drug? Let me think. In some contexts, "hie" might be a variation of "high", but that's not a drug. Alternatively, maybe "hie" is a term used in a specific subculture. 

Wait, the example given in the problem includes "lean" as a slang for codeine. The user's post has "hie". Since "hie" isn't listed in the index terms, and there's no direct match, the correct index term would be "other". 

But wait, maybe "hie" is a typo or a misspelling. Let me check again. The index terms don't have "hie" listed. So, the matched phrase is "hie", and since it's not in the list, it should be "other". 

So the output would be an object with index_term "other" and matched_phrase "hie".
