Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that says: "#nowplaying Morphine / The Night / The Night #morphine â™«". I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look for words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs or substances. The post mentions "Morphine" in the hashtag. Checking the index terms, Morphine is listed as an index term. The entry for Morphine says it's the prototypical opioid analgesic used for severe pain but prone to tolerance and dependence. So "Morphine" directly maps to the index term "Morphine".

The rest of the post is about a song title, "The Night / The Night", which doesn't seem to relate to any drugs. The hashtag #morphine is just the name of the song or artist, not referring to the drug. There's no other mention of drugs here. So the only match is "Morphine".

I should make sure there's no slang or alternative names for Morphine in the post. The user used "Morphine" as the exact term, which is in the index terms. So the correct JSON array should have one object with index_term "Morphine" and matched_phrase "Morphine".
