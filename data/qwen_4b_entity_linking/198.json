Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "I chose alcohol. That was stupid af. I shoulda chose the damn codeine." I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll go through each word or phrase. The first part is "I chose alcohol." Alcohol isn't listed in the index terms, so that's "other". Then "That was stupid af." "Af" is a slang for "as fuck," which is a strong expression but not a drug. Next, "I shoulda chose the damn codeine." "Codeine" is definitely in the index terms under "Codeine". The phrase "the damn codeine" matches the index term "Codeine". 

So the only detected phrase here is "codeine". The other parts don't refer to any illicit drugs listed. Therefore, the JSON should have one entry with index_term "Codeine" and matched_phrase "codeine".
