Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Bro. Don't forget, he's Keith Richard's son. Good Anti whiskey and heroin genes." I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll go through each part of the post. The first part is about Keith Richard's son, which is a reference to a person, but not a drug. Then "Good Anti whiskey and heroin genes." The words "whiskey" and "heroin" are mentioned. 

Looking at the index terms, "heroin" is listed under Morphine, which is an opioid. So "heroin" would map to "Morphine". However, "whiskey" is a type of alcohol, not a drug listed in the index terms. The example in the prompt shows that if a term isn't in the list, it's marked as "other". So "whiskey" would be "other". 

Wait, but the user's instruction says to check for any illicit drugs, including references to them. However, "whiskey" is a drink, not a drug. The index terms don't include alcohol, so "whiskey" would be "other". 

So the detected phrases are "heroin" and "whiskey". "Heroin" maps to Morphine. "Whiskey" is not in the list, so "other". 

But wait, the example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other. So same logic applies here. Therefore, the JSON should have two entries: one for "heroin" under Morphine, and "whiskey" as other.
