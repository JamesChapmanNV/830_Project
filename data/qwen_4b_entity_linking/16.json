Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references. The post is: "New 'fraud squad' will crack down on criminals who steal taxpayer money -". 

First, I need to go through each word and phrase to see if they match any of the index terms listed. The key here is to check for slang, euphemisms, or any synonyms for illicit drugs. 

Looking at the post, the main words are "fraud squad", "crack down", "criminals", "steal taxpayer money". None of these words directly relate to drugs. "Fraud squad" might be a metaphor for a group targeting fraud, but there's no mention of drugs here. The terms "criminals" and "steal taxpayer money" are about financial crimes, not drug use. 

I should check if any phrases could be slang for drugs. For example, "steal taxpayer money" is about theft, not drugs. "Fraud squad" doesn't map to any drug terms in the index list. The example given in the problem had "xans" which wasn't a drug term, so it was marked as "other". 

Since there are no words that match the index terms for drugs, the correct response would be to list "other" for any phrases that don't fit. But in this case, there are no drug-related phrases at all. Wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" which was "other", but here there are no such terms. 

So the output should be an empty array? Because there are no matches. But the examples show that even if there's no match, you list "other" for each phrase. However, in this post, there are no phrases that refer to drugs. So the JSON array would be empty. 

Wait, the instructions say to return only the valid JSON array with objects per match. If there are no matches, then the array is empty. So the answer is an empty list. But let me double-check. The post doesn't mention any drugs, so there's nothing to detect. Therefore, the correct response is an empty array.
