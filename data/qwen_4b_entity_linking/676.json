Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that needs to be moderated for drug-related references. The task is to detect any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs or substances, link them to the appropriate Index Terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read through the post carefully: "HIT HER WITH NO CONDOM HAD TO MAKE HER EAT A PLAN B AND IM SIPPIN ON THAT CODEINE NOT BRANDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Looking for drug-related terms. The first part mentions "HIT HER WITH NO CONDOM" – that's about condom use, but not a drug. Then "HAD TO MAKE HER EAT A PLAN B" – Plan B is a morning-after pill, which is a contraceptive, not a drug. But wait, in some contexts, "plan B" could be slang for a drug? Hmm, but according to the Index Terms, I don't see Plan B listed. The Index Terms include things like Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall), Codeine (Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy), etc. Plan B isn't listed, so if it's not in the list, it should be "other". But the user's example 3 had "xans" which is not in the list, so "other". So "plan b" would be "other".

Next part: "IM SIPPIN ON THAT CODEINE NOT BRANDY". "Codeine" is explicitly listed under the Codeine index term. The phrase "codeine" is a direct match. Also, "sipping on codeine" is a way of referring to using codeine. The user's example 1 had "lean" and "codeine" both mapped to Codeine. So "codeine" here is a direct match. The other part is "NOT BRANDY" – Brandy is a type of alcohol, not a drug. So that's not a drug reference.

So the detected phrases are "plan b" and "codeine". Now, mapping them. "Codeine" is in the list, so index_term is Codeine. "Plan B" is not in the list, so index_term is "other". 

Wait, but in the example 3, "xans" was "other" even though it's a benzodiazepine. So "plan b" is a contraceptive, not a drug listed here, so "other". 

So the JSON array should have two entries: one for "plan b" as other, and one for "codeine" as Codeine. But wait, the user's example 1 had "lean" and "codeine" both mapped. So in this case, "codeine" is the only drug term here. Wait, the post says "sipping on that codeine not brandy". So "codeine" is the only drug term here. But "plan b" is not a drug. So the only match is "codeine".

Wait, but the user's example 3 had "xans" which is not in the list, so "other". So "plan b" is not in the list, so "other". But the post says "plan b" as in the morning-after pill. But the Index Terms don't have any entries for that. So "plan b" is "other".

So the correct matches are:

- "codeine" → Codeine
- "plan b" → other

But wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other, even though they might be slang. So in this case, "plan b" is not a drug, so "other". But the user's example 3 had "xans" as other, even though it's a benzodiazepine. So "plan b" is not in the list, so "other".

Therefore, the JSON array should have two entries: one for "codeine" and one for "plan b" as other. Wait, but the user's example 1 had two entries for the same drug. But in this case, the post mentions "codeine" once and "plan b" once. So the output should be two entries. However, the user's example 3 had "xans" as other. So I need to check if "plan b" is a drug. But according to the Index Terms, Plan B is not listed. So "plan b" is "other". 

So the final answer is:

[
  {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "codeine"},
  {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "plan b"}
]

But wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other. So in the post, "plan b" is a phrase that's not a drug, so "other". So that's correct.
