Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Actiq, the fentalyl lollipop was clearly developed with rappers in mind." I need to identify any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look for words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The post mentions "Actiq" and "fentalyl lollipop." Let me check the index terms.

Looking at the list, "Fentanyl" is listed under index terms with synonyms like China White, Apache, Duragesic. "Fentalyl" sounds like a misspelling or slang for fentanyl. "Actiq" is a brand name for a fentanyl product. So "fentalyl" is likely a slang term for fentanyl. 

The index term for fentanyl is "Fentanyl (China White, Apache, Duragesic)." So "fentalyl" would map to that. "Actiq" is a registered trademark, but since it's a product containing fentanyl, it's considered a drug reference. However, the index term list includes "Fentanyl" as the index term, so "Actiq" would be matched to Fentanyl as well. 

Wait, the task says to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. "Actiq" is a prescription medication, but since it's a fentanyl product, it's still a drug reference. However, the index terms don't have "Actiq" specifically. So the correct index term would be "Fentanyl" for both "Actiq" and "fentalyl lollipop." 

So the matched phrases are "Actiq" and "fentalyl." Both should be linked to "Fentanyl." Let me confirm. The index term for fentanyl includes "China White, Apache, Duragesic," but "fentalyl" is a variation. Since "fentalyl" is a slang or misspelling, it's still under fentanyl. 

Therefore, the JSON array should have two entries: one for "Actiq" and one for "fentalyl lollipop." Wait, the exact phrase is "fentalyl lollipop." But the index term is Fentanyl. So the matched_phrase is "fentalyl lollipop," and index_term is Fentanyl. 

But the example in the problem shows that "lean" is mapped to Codeine. So even if the phrase is a longer phrase, like "fentalyl lollipop," it's still matched to the index term. So the answer would be two entries: "Actiq" and "fentalyl lollipop" both under Fentanyl.
