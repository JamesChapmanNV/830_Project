Okay, let's see. The user provided a post: "That he scored more coke from his dealer." I need to detect any drug references here.

First, I'll look for words that might refer to illicit drugs. The word "coke" is a common slang for cocaine. Checking the index terms, cocaine is listed as "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine. But wait, the index terms list "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" and "Cocaine" isn't directly listed. Wait, looking back at the Index Terms list, cocaine is actually mentioned as "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite. However, the main drug name is cocaine. But in the index terms, the term for cocaine is not explicitly listed as "Cocaine" but rather as the metabolite. Wait, no, looking again, the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite, but the actual drug is cocaine. However, in the index terms, there's no separate entry for cocaine itself. Wait, the user's task is to link the detected phrase to the index term. So if the phrase is "coke", which is slang for cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is not present. Wait, looking back at the Index Terms list, the entry for cocaine is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite. But the actual drug is cocaine. However, in the index terms, there's no separate entry for cocaine. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Looking at the Index Terms list, there's an entry for "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)"? No, wait, the Amphetamine entry is listed as "Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)". The cocaine entry is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite. But the actual drug is cocaine. However, the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine. So if the phrase is "coke", which is slang for cocaine, but the index term for that is not listed. Therefore, according to the task, if the drug is not in the list, use "other". Wait, but the index terms include "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine, but the actual drug is cocaine. However, the index terms don't have an entry for cocaine itself. Therefore, if the detected phrase is "coke", which refers to cocaine, but the index term for that is not present, so we should use "other".

Wait, but in the example provided, in example 4, "snow" and "white lines" are considered "other" because they aren't on the list. So if "coke" is a slang term for cocaine, but the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine, then "coke" would be "other". However, the index term for Benzoylecgonine is the metabolite, but the actual drug is cocaine. But the index terms don't list cocaine as a separate term. Therefore, the correct index term here would be "other".

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the index terms again. The index terms list "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite of cocaine. So if the phrase is "coke", which refers to cocaine, but the index term for that is not present, so it's "other". Therefore, in this case, the matched phrase is "coke", and the index term is "other".

So the answer should be [{"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "coke"}].
