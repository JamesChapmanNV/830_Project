Okay, let's see. The user provided a post: "Tauqeer said Property Dealer Peshawar Ring Road Latif abad". I need to check if there are any drug-related references here.

First, I'll go through each word. "Tauqeer" is a name, probably a person. "said" is a verb. "Property Dealer" refers to someone who sells property. "Peshawar" is a city in Pakistan. "Ring Road" is a type of road. "Latif abad" is a place name, maybe a neighborhood or street. 

Looking at the Index Terms list, I need to check if any of these words or phrases match a drug term. The Index Terms include things like Codeine, Amphetamine, Benzodiazepines, etc. But in this post, there's no mention of drugs. The words are all related to real estate or locations. 

The example where "snow" was considered "other" because it's not a drug. Similarly, "Property Dealer" isn't a drug term. So, there are no matches here. Therefore, all the phrases in the post don't refer to illicit drugs. So the answer should be an empty array.
