Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about surgery and pain management. The main points are that the person had surgery, was in pain, took Norco because they were allergic to Morphine, and got a prescription from CVS Pharmacy at Target on the Katy Freeway.

First, I need to check for any drug-related references. The post mentions "Norco," which is a brand name for Hydrocodone, a semi-synthetic opioid. Looking at the Index Terms, Hydrocodone is listed under "Hydrocodone (Vicodin, Norco, Vike)" as a commonly prescribed semi-synthetic opioid. So "Norco" would map to Hydrocodone.

Next, "Morphine" is mentioned as an allergy. Morphine is listed under "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" as the prototypical opioid analgesic. So "Morphine" would map to that index term.

The rest of the post talks about a pharmacy and location, which don't relate to drugs. The phrase "Norco" is a brand name, so the matched phrase should be "Norco," and "Morphine" is directly listed. Both are in the index terms, so no need for "other."

I need to make sure there are no other terms. The post doesn't mention any other drugs or slang. So the JSON array should have two entries: one for Norco (Hydrocodone) and one for Morphine (Morphine).
