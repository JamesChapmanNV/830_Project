Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array. First, I need to read the post carefully: "I'll let you know soon. I prob won't crack it open for a few days or a week. We have guests arriving on the 8th! :D".

Looking for any words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The post mentions "crack it open". Now, "crack" can sometimes be slang for crack cocaine, which is a form of cocaine. But wait, the index terms include "Cocaine" but the list doesn't have "crack" as a specific term. However, the index term for cocaine is listed, and "crack" is a form of cocaine. But in the example, "snow" was categorized as "other" because it's not on the list. Wait, the index terms include "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine. But the main term for cocaine is just "Cocaine". However, the user's instruction says to check if the drug is in the list. Since "crack" isn't listed as an index term, but cocaine is, but "crack" is a form of cocaine. However, the index terms don't have "crack" as a separate term. So, in the example where "snow" was used, it was "other" because it's not on the list. So, "crack" is a form of cocaine, but since the index term is "Cocaine", but "crack" isn't listed as an index term. Wait, the index terms include "Cocaine" as a term. But the user's instruction says to link to the index term if it's in the list. So "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term is "Cocaine". However, the example given in the problem shows that "lean" is linked to "Codeine", which is correct. But in the example, "snow" was "other" because it's not on the list. So, "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is "Cocaine". But the user might not have "crack" as an index term. Wait, looking back at the index terms, the only cocaine-related term is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite, but the main term is "Cocaine". So, "Cocaine" is listed as an index term. Therefore, "crack" is a form of cocaine, so it should be linked to "Cocaine". But wait, the index term for cocaine is "Cocaine", but the user's instruction says to check if the drug is in the list. So, "crack" is a slang term for cocaine, but the index term is "Cocaine". However, in the example, "snow" was "other" because it's not on the list. So, in this case, "crack" is a slang term for cocaine, but the index term is "Cocaine", so "crack" would map to "Cocaine". But wait, the index terms don't have "crack" as a term. The index term is "Cocaine", which is the main term. So, if the phrase is "crack", it's a form of cocaine, so the index term would be "Cocaine". But the user's example for "snow" was "other" because it's not on the list. But "crack" is a form of cocaine, which is in the list. Therefore, "crack" should be mapped to "Cocaine". However, in the example given, "xans" was "other" because it's not on the list. So, "crack" is a form of cocaine, which is in the list, so it should be mapped to "Cocaine". But wait, the index term for cocaine is "Cocaine", but the user's instruction says to check if the drug is in the list. So, "crack" is a slang term for cocaine, which is in the list. Therefore, "crack" should be mapped to "Cocaine". But the user's example for "snow" was "other" because it's not on the list. However, "crack" is a form of cocaine, which is in the list. Therefore, the correct index term would be "Cocaine". But I need to check the index terms again. The index terms include "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" but wait, no, looking back, the index terms list "Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" as a separate entry. So, "Cocaine" is listed as a separate index term. Therefore, "crack" is a form of cocaine, so the index term is "Cocaine". But the user's example for "snow" was "other", which is not on the list. Therefore, in this case, "crack" is a slang term for cocaine, which is in the list. So, the matched phrase is "crack", index term is "Cocaine". However, the user's example for "lean" was mapped to "Codeine", which is correct. So, in this case, the post has "crack it open". The phrase "crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine, so the index term is "Cocaine". But wait, the index terms don't have "crack" as a term, but "Cocaine" is listed. Therefore, "crack" would be mapped to "Cocaine". But the user's example for "snow" was "other" because it's not on the list. However, "crack" is a form of cocaine, which is in the list. Therefore, the correct mapping would be "Cocaine" for "crack". But I need to check if "crack" is considered a drug in the index terms. The index term for cocaine is "Cocaine", and "crack" is a form of it. Therefore, the answer would be {"index_term": "Cocaine", "matched_phrase": "crack"}.

Wait, but the user's example 4 shows that "snow" is "other" because it's not on the list. But "crack" is a form of cocaine, which is in the list. Therefore, "crack" should be mapped to "Cocaine". However, in the index terms, "Cocaine" is listed, but the example shows that "snow" is "other". Therefore, the correct answer here is that "crack" is mapped to "Cocaine". Therefore, the JSON array would have one entry: {"index_term": "Cocaine", "matched_phrase": "crack"}.

But wait, the user's instruction says to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. "Crack" is a form of cocaine, which is an illicit drug. Therefore, it should be mapped to "Cocaine". However, the index terms list "Cocaine" as a separate term. Therefore, the correct answer is to map "crack" to "Cocaine".
