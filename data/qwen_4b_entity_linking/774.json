Okay, let's see. The user provided a post about dental health, talking about using teeth to chew food, ripping tape, opening packaging, and the consequences like cracked teeth, root canals, etc. The task is to detect any drug-related references in the post and link them to the index terms.

First, I need to go through the post carefully. The post mentions "teeth" a few times, but that's just about dental health. The hashtags are #dental, #oralhealth, #teeth, #smilehealthplex, #healthplex. None of these seem related to drugs. The content is all about the dangers of using teeth for non-dental purposes and the resulting dental issues. 

Looking at the index terms list, I need to check if any of the phrases in the post match any drug terms. The post doesn't mention any drugs, slang terms, or euphemisms. Words like "teeth," "chew," "crack," "root canal," "crown," "pulled" are all related to dental procedures, not drugs. 

The example given in the problem had "lean" and "codeine" linked to Codeine. But in this case, there's no mention of any drugs. The user might be testing if there's any hidden reference, but I don't see any. The hashtags are about oral health, not drugs. 

So, the answer should be an empty array because there are no drug-related terms in the post. The JSON array should have no objects. The user's instruction says to return only the JSON array with matches, so if there are none, it's just an empty list.
