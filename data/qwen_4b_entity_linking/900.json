Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about a cocktail recipe and wants me to check for any drug-related references. The task is to detect any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The post says: "Cocktail: Okay Squirrel. Recipe: 2 oz. rum, 1 oz. olive juice, 1 oz. arak, 2 dashes holy basil tea, cucumber." 

Now, I need to look for any terms that might be slang, euphemisms, or synonyms for drugs. Let's break down each ingredient:

- Rum: That's a common alcohol, not a drug. Unless there's a specific context where rum is associated with drugs, but I don't think so here.
- Olive juice: Just a type of juice, no drug reference.
- Arak: Hmm, arak is a type of spirit, similar to absinthe. It's a strong alcohol, but not an illicit drug. Unless there's a slang term I'm missing. But according to the index terms, arak isn't listed as a drug. So probably not.
- Holy basil tea: That's a herbal tea, not a drug. Unless it's a slang term, but I don't think so.
- Cucumber: Just an ingredient, not a drug.

Looking through the index terms list, none of these ingredients are listed as drugs. The terms like rum, arak, holy basil tea, olive juice, cucumber are all common ingredients and not associated with illicit drugs. The example where "snow" was considered "other" because it's not a drug, so similarly, these items are just regular ingredients.

So, there are no drug references in this post. Therefore, the JSON array should be empty. But wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" which wasn't a drug, so it was marked as "other". But in this case, none of the terms are drugs. So the correct response is an empty array. However, the user's instruction says to return only the valid JSON array with matches. If there are no matches, then the array is empty. But the user's examples show that even if there's no match, they return the array with objects. Wait, no, in example 3, the post had "xans" which wasn't a drug, so it was marked as "other". But in this case, none of the terms are drugs. So the answer should be an empty array. But maybe I need to check again.

Wait, the user's instruction says: if the drug is not in the list, use "other". So if none of the terms are in the index terms, then each matched phrase would be "other". But in this case, none of the terms are drugs. So the array would be empty. But the user's example 3 had "xans" which was not a drug, so it was marked as "other". However, in this case, the post doesn't have any drug references. Therefore, the correct answer is an empty array. But the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as "other". So in this case, the post has no drug terms, so the array is empty. Therefore, the correct output is an empty JSON array.
