Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Strimmed the banks and donned chest waders to cut back weeds and reeds yesterday. Now where did I put my codeine phosphate?". I need to detect any drug references here.

First, I'll go through each word and phrase. The first part talks about strimming banks, wearing waders, cutting weeds and reeds. Those are all gardening or maintenance activities. No drug terms there. 

Then the second part: "Now where did I put my codeine phosphate?". The key phrase here is "codeine phosphate". Looking at the index terms, Codeine is listed with synonyms like Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy. Codeine phosphate is a form of codeine, so it should map to the Codeine index term. 

I need to check if "codeine phosphate" is exactly matched. The index term for Codeine includes "codeine", so "codeine phosphate" is a specific form but still falls under the Codeine category. The task says to match exact text, so even though it's a variant, it's still codeine. 

No other phrases in the post seem to reference drugs. The rest are about activities and a question about where codeine is. So the only match is "codeine phosphate" under Codeine. 

I should return a JSON array with one object: index_term "Codeine" and matched_phrase "codeine phosphate".
