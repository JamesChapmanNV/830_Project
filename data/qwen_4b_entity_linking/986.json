Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "That codeine did its job I don't feel sick anymore ðŸ˜­". I need to detect any drug references here.

First, I'll look for words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The post mentions "codeine". Checking the index terms, Codeine is listed with synonyms like Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy. The phrase "codeine" is directly listed, so that's a clear match. The user is talking about using codeine, so that's an explicit reference. There's no other slang or euphemism here. The rest of the sentence is about the effect of codeine, but the key term is "codeine". Since it's in the index terms, the index term is Codeine. No other terms are present. So the JSON should have one entry with index_term "Codeine" and matched_phrase "codeine".
