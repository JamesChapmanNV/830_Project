Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that needs to be checked for drug-related references. The post is: "gmgOFbPAeOfeIM - Hold the line, please promethazine without codeine street value As the overall Marine commander...". 

First, I need to scan through the text for any terms that might refer to illicit drugs or substances. The user is asking for every word or phrase that's a slang, euphemism, synonym, or cultural reference related to drugs. 

Looking at the post, the first part is "gmgOFbPAeOfeIM" which seems like a random string of letters, probably not relevant. Then, "Hold the line, please promethazine without codeine street value". 

Breaking it down: "promethazine" is a drug. Let me check the index terms. Promethazine is listed under Diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Nytol) as a first-generation antihistamine with sedative effects. So "promethazine" would map to Diphenhydramine. 

Next, "without codeine". Codeine is explicitly listed in the index terms under Codeine (Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy). So "codeine" is a direct match. 

The phrase "street value" might be a reference to the value of the drug on the street, but "street value" itself isn't a drug name. However, the context here is that they're talking about promethazine without codeine, so "codeine" is the key term here. 

So the detected phrases are "promethazine" and "codeine". 

Now, mapping them to the index terms. Promethazine is under Diphenhydramine, and codeine is under Codeine. 

Wait, but the user's example 3 had "xans" which wasn't on the list, so it was "other". But here, promethazine is in the list as Diphenhydramine, so that's a valid index term. Codeine is also in the list. 

So the JSON should have two entries: one for Diphenhydramine with "promethazine", and another for Codeine with "codeine". 

I need to make sure there are no other terms. The rest of the post is "As the overall Marine commander..." which doesn't seem relevant. 

So the final answer should be two objects in the array.
