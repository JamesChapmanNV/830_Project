Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references. First, I need to read through the post carefully.

The post says: "Well said. This all applies to toys, computers, auto parts, spatulas, appliances, clothing, and just about anything else you can think of. Hard to imagine that the board game industry is somehow going to crack the code that none of those other industries can (or want to)."

Looking for any words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. Let me go through each part. The first part lists various items like toys, computers, auto parts, etc. None of these are drugs. The second part mentions "board game industry" and "crack the code." The word "code" is used here, but in the context of the example given, "code" isn't listed as a drug term. The index terms include things like Codeine, Amphetamine, LSD, etc. "Code" itself isn't an index term, so if "code" is used in a drug context, it would be "other." But in this case, the post is talking about industry codes, not drug references. 

Wait, the user's examples show that "codeine" is an index term, but "code" as a standalone word isn't. The post uses "code" in the sense of a code or system, not a drug. So there's no drug-related phrase here. The post is about industries and codes, not drugs. Therefore, there are no matches. The answer should be an empty array.
