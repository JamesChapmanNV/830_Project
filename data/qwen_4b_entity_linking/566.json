Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about U.S. vehicle sales dropping 26% in September due to chip shortages and supply issues. The task is to detect any drug-related references and map them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The post mentions "chip shortages" and "supply disruptions," but there's no mention of drugs or substances. The keywords here are "vehicle sales," "tumbled," "September," "chip shortages," and "supply disruptions." None of these terms relate to illicit drugs, prescription medications, or any other substances listed in the index terms. 

I need to check if any slang or euphemisms might be present. Words like "chip" could be a red herring, but in this context, it's referring to semiconductor chips, not drugs. The phrase "supply disruptions" is about logistics, not drug-related terms. 

Looking at the index terms list, there's a lot of drug names and their synonyms, but none of them are present in the post. The post doesn't mention any drug names, slang terms, or phrases that would match the index terms. 

The example given in the problem where "snow" was mapped to "other" because it's not a drug, but in this case, the post doesn't have any terms that could be considered drug references. So, there are no matches here. 

Therefore, the correct response is an empty array since there are no drug-related phrases detected in the post.
