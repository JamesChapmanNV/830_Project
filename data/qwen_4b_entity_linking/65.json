Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Mix that sprite up with that lean i love my Codeine🍇🍼". I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look for words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The post mentions "lean" and "Codeine". Checking the index terms, "Codeine" has synonyms like "Lean" and "Purple Drank", so "lean" maps to Codeine. Then "Codeine" is directly mentioned, so that's another match. The other words like "sprite" and "葡萄" (grape) are probably just regular words or emojis, not drugs. Since "lean" and "Codeine" are both in the index terms, those are the matches. The rest don't relate to drugs, so they should be marked as "other" if they were, but in this case, they aren't. So the JSON should have two entries: one for "lean" and one for "Codeine".
