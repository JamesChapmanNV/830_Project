Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about U.S. vehicle sales dropping 26% in September due to chip shortages and supply issues. My task is to check for any drug-related references and map them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The main points are about vehicle sales, chip shortages, and supply chain disruptions. There's no mention of any drugs, substances, or slang related to illicit drugs. The words used are "tumbled," "sales," "chip shortages," "supply disruptions," "selection," "dealer lots." None of these terms are associated with drugs. 

Looking at the index terms list, I need to ensure that none of the phrases in the post match any of the drug terms. For example, terms like "codeine," "amphetamines," "cocaine," "fentanyl," etc., are all specific to drugs. The post doesn't mention any of these. 

The example given in the problem where "snow" was mapped to "other" because it's not a drug, but in this case, the post doesn't have any such terms. The user might be testing if I can recognize that there are no drug references here. 

So, the answer should be an empty array since there are no matches. The JSON array should only include objects when there are matches, but here there are none. Therefore, the correct response is an empty list.
