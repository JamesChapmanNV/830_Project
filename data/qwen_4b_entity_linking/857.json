Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for help with a post about a dealer waiting for a front passenger occupant sensor for their Aviator. The task is to detect any drug-related references in the post and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The post says: "can you help my dealer out? They have been waiting over a MONTH for a front passenger occupant sensor for my Aviator. It's getting old not being able to use my front passenger seat."

Looking for any slang, euphemisms, or terms that might refer to illicit drugs. The words here are "dealer," "front passenger occupant sensor," "Aviator," and "front passenger seat." 

Now, checking the list of index terms. The term "dealer" could be a reference to a drug dealer, but in this context, it's more likely referring to a car dealer or someone selling a vehicle. The phrase "front passenger occupant sensor" seems technical, related to car parts. There's no mention of any drugs or substances here. 

The user might be confused, but the post is about a car part issue, not drug-related. The word "dealer" could be a red herring, but without any other terms matching the index list, there's nothing to link here. 

So, there are no drug references in this post. The answer should be an empty array since no matches were found.
