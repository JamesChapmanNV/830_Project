Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that needs to be checked for drug-related references. The task is to detect any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs or substances, link them to the correct Index Term, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll look at the post: "BIRDS IN THE TRAP SING BRIAN MCKNIGHT PERCOCET AND CODEINE PLS DON'T TAKE MY LIFE". The main parts here are "PERCOCET" and "CODEINE". 

Looking at the Index Terms list, "Oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet, Hillbilly Heroin)" is listed. So "Percocet" is a synonym for Oxycodone, which is a semi-synthetic opioid. Therefore, "Percocet" maps to "Oxycodone" in the Index Terms.

Next, "CODEINE" is directly listed under "Codeine (Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy)" as an index term. So "codeine" is a direct match.

The rest of the post seems to be unrelated, like "BIRDS IN THE TRAP SING BRIAN MCKNIGHT" which is likely a reference to a song or a metaphor, not a drug. "PLS DON'T TAKE MY LIFE" is a plea, not a drug reference. 

So the detected phrases are "Percocet" and "Codeine". Both are in the Index Terms. No other terms here. The answer should be two entries in JSON format.
