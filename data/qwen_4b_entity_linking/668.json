Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that mentions King George V being euthanized with morphine and cocaine. My task is to detect any drug references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I need to check each word or phrase in the post. The post says "morphine and cocaine". Looking at the index terms list, Morphine is listed under "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" as the prototypical opioid. So "morphine" would map to that index term. 

Next, "cocaine" is mentioned. The index terms include "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the primary metabolite of cocaine. However, the index term for cocaine itself isn't directly listed. Wait, the index terms list includes "Cocaine" as a separate entry? Let me check again. No, looking back, the index terms don't have a direct entry for "Cocaine". The only related term is Benzoylecgonine, which is the metabolite. But the post mentions "cocaine" as the substance used. Since "cocaine" isn't in the index terms list, I should use "other" for that. 

Wait, the index terms list includes "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the primary metabolite of cocaine. But the actual drug name "cocaine" isn't listed. So when the post says "cocaine", since it's not in the index terms, it should be categorized as "other". 

So the two drugs here are morphine and cocaine. Morphine maps to the index term "Morphine", and cocaine maps to "other". Therefore, the JSON array should have two entries: one for morphine and one for cocaine as "other".
