Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Should crack down on the open drinking. That's just fuel for violence." I need to check for any drug-related references here.

First, I'll scan each word. The main words are "crack down," "open drinking," "fuel for violence." The task is to detect any slang, euphemisms, or synonyms for illicit drugs. 

"Open drinking" might refer to alcohol, but alcohol isn't listed in the index terms. The index terms include drugs like amphetamine, codeine, cocaine, etc. The post doesn't mention any specific drugs. "Fuel for violence" is a metaphor, but not a drug reference. 

Looking at the examples, "xans" was considered "other" because it wasn't a listed term. Similarly, "snow" in example 4 was "other." Since "drinking" here is general and not a specific drug, it's not in the list. Therefore, there are no matches. The answer should be an empty array.
