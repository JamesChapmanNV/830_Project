Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "What drugs do you take? Heroin, cocaine like the ukrainian comedian?" I need to detect any drug references here.

First, I'll break down the post. The user is asking about drugs they take, mentioning heroin and cocaine. The phrase "like the ukrainian comedian" might be a slang reference. Let me check the index terms.

Looking at the list, heroin is listed under Morphine as "MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph". So "heroin" would map to Morphine. Then "cocaine" is mentioned. Wait, the index terms include Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate) as the primary metabolite of cocaine. But the term "cocaine" itself isn't directly listed. However, the index term for cocaine is Benzoylecgonine. But the example in the problem shows that "snow" in example 4 is "other" because it's not on the list. Wait, the index terms list "Cocaine" as Benzoylecgonine. Wait, no, looking back, the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite of cocaine. But the actual drug name "cocaine" isn't directly in the index terms. Wait, the index terms list "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" as the most widely used illicit drug. But cocaine isn't listed as an index term. Wait, the index terms include "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite of cocaine, but the actual drug name "cocaine" isn't in the list. However, in the example 4, "snow" is considered "other" because it's not on the list. So if the post mentions "cocaine", is that considered "other"? Wait, but the index terms have "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite, but the actual drug name "cocaine" is not listed. However, the user might be referring to the drug itself. Wait, the index terms list "Cocaine" as a separate entry? Let me check again.

Looking at the index terms list again. The index terms include "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite of cocaine. But the actual drug "cocaine" isn't listed as an index term. Wait, the index terms list "Cocaine" as part of the metabolite? Wait no, the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite of cocaine. So if the post says "cocaine", is that considered "other"? Because the index terms don't have "Cocaine" as an index term. But in the example 3, "xans" is "other" because it's not in the list. So in this case, "cocaine" isn't listed as an index term. Therefore, "cocaine" would map to "other". However, the user might be referring to the drug itself. Wait, but the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite. But the actual drug is cocaine. But the index terms don't have "Cocaine" as an index term. So the correct mapping would be "other" for "cocaine". Similarly, "heroin" is listed under Morphine. Wait, the index terms have "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" as the index term. So "heroin" is a different drug, but in the index terms, it's not directly listed. Wait, the index terms list "Morphine" as the index term. But heroin is a different drug. Wait, the index terms list "Morphine" as the index term, and "Heroin" is not in the list. Wait, looking back at the index terms, the entry for Morphine is: "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph) – The prototypical opioid analgesic used for severe pain but prone to tolerance and dependence." So "heroin" is not directly listed. However, the index terms include "6-Acetylmorphine (6-Monoacetylmorphine, 6-MAM) – An active intermediate metabolite formed almost immediately after heroin use." So heroin is a drug that leads to 6-MAM. But the index term for heroin isn't listed. So in the post, "heroin" would be considered "other" because it's not directly listed. Wait, but the user is asking about drugs they take. So "heroin" is a drug, but the index terms don't have it. Therefore, "heroin" would map to "other". However, the example 1 has "lean" mapping to Codeine, which is in the list. So in this case, "heroin" is not in the index terms, so it's "other". Similarly, "cocaine" is not in the index terms, so "other". But wait, the index terms do have "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite of cocaine. But the actual drug name is not in the list. So the user's mention of "cocaine" would be "other". Therefore, the matched phrases are "heroin" and "cocaine", both mapped to "other". But wait, maybe the user is using "heroin" as a slang term. But according to the index terms, "heroin" is not listed. So the correct answer would be both "heroin" and "cocaine" as "other".
