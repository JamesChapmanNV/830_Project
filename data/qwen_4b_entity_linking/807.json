Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Lil Nigo X Camouflage Codeine the mixtape is coming very soon..". I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll scan the post for keywords. The phrase "Codeine" is explicitly mentioned. Looking at the Index Terms, Codeine is listed with synonyms like "Lean", "Purple Drank", "Schoolboy". The post uses "Codeine" directly, so that's a clear match. The name "Lil Nigo X Camouflage" might be a reference to a mixtape or collaboration, but "Camouflage Codeine" could be a play on words. However, "Codeine" is the key term here. 

Wait, the user's task is to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. "Camouflage Codeine" might be a way to refer to codeine, but "Camouflage" itself isn't a drug. However, the phrase "Camouflage Codeine" could be a slang term. But according to the Index Terms, "Codeine" is listed, so "Codeine" is the main term here. The "Camouflage" part might not be a drug reference. 

So the only direct match is "Codeine". The rest of the post is about a mixtape, which isn't related. Therefore, the JSON should have one entry with index_term "Codeine" and matched_phrase "Codeine". The user's example shows that "lean" and "codeine" are both matched. But in this case, the post uses "Codeine" directly. So the correct output is just the "Codeine" entry.
