Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Innovation drives shift in cannabis product demand, especially around 4/20". I need to check for any drug-related references here.

First, I'll scan the post for keywords. The main terms are "cannabis" and "4/20". Looking at the index terms, there's an entry for "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" which is listed as an illicit drug. So "cannabis" here would map to that index term. 

Next, "4/20" is a cultural reference to cannabis use, often associated with the drug. But wait, the index terms don't have a specific entry for "4/20". The closest is "Marijuana" under the cannabis entry. Since "4/20" is a slang or cultural reference to cannabis, it should be linked to "Marijuana". 

However, the task says to check if the drug is in the list. Since "Marijuana" is in the list, "4/20" is a reference to it. So both "cannabis" and "4/20" would map to "Marijuana". 

Wait, but the example in the prompt shows that "snow" and "white lines" in example 4 are marked as "other" because they aren't directly drug terms. But "cannabis" is explicitly listed. So "cannabis" is a direct match. "4/20" is a cultural reference but still refers to cannabis, so it's a valid match. 

Therefore, the matched phrases are "cannabis" and "4/20", both under "Marijuana". But wait, the index term for marijuana is "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)", so the index_term should be "Marijuana". 

So the JSON array should have two entries: one for "cannabis" and one for "4/20", both with index_term "Marijuana".
