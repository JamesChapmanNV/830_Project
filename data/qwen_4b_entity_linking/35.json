Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "going to do another itzy album review bc listening to them is like shooting up morphine". I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll break down the sentence. The key parts are "itzy album review" and "listening to them is like shooting up morphine". The phrase "shooting up morphine" is a clear reference to intravenous drug use. Morphine is listed in the index terms as an opioid analgesic. So "shooting up morphine" would map to "Morphine". 

Next, "itzy" is a slang term for a K-pop group, so that's not a drug reference. The rest of the sentence is about an album review, which is unrelated. 

I should check if there are any other possible terms. The phrase "like shooting up morphine" is a metaphor for the intense effect of morphine, which is a known drug. Since "morphine" is in the index list, that's the term to use. There's no other drug mentioned here. 

So the only matched phrase is "shooting up morphine", which links to "Morphine". The other parts of the sentence don't contain any other drug references. I need to make sure that "shooting up" is part of the matched phrase. The exact text is "shooting up morphine", so that's the matched_phrase. 

No other terms in the post relate to drugs. The answer should be a JSON array with one object for "Morphine" and the matched phrase.
