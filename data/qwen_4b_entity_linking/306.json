Okay, let's see. The user provided a post that seems to be a narrative or a story. My task is to detect any drug-related references in the post and link them to the appropriate index terms. But first, I need to go through the post carefully.

The post starts with "kisuke into the world of the living." Hmm, "kisuke" doesn't ring a bell as a drug term. Then, "thought process was cut short when the male decided to crack a joke." No drugs here. Next, "her hand balled up into a fist." Still nothing. 

The line "I was not referring myself to a gremlin but I can show you how one would treat old shopkeepers." "Gremlin" is a mythical creature, not a drug. Then, "opting to be kind, she flicked â€”" The end of the sentence is cut off. 

Looking through the entire post again, there's no mention of any drugs, slang terms, or phrases related to illicit substances. The example given in the problem had "lean" and "codeine" which are linked to Codeine. But in this post, there's no such terms. The user might have intended to test if I can recognize that there are no drug references here. 

So, according to the instructions, if there are no matches, the output should be an empty array. The examples show that when there are no matches, the JSON array is empty. The third example had "xans" which wasn't on the list, so it was "other". But in this case, there are no drug-related phrases at all. Therefore, the correct response is an empty array.
