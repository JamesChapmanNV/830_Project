Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "My friend doesnt crack his back neck fingers he only cracks his Feet. Disgusting". The task is to detect any drug-related references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I need to scan the post for any slang, euphemisms, or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The post talks about someone cracking their feet, which is a physical action. The words "crack his back neck fingers" and "cracks his Feet" are mentioned. 

Now, I need to check if any of these phrases are associated with drugs in the provided index terms. Looking through the list, I see terms like Codeine (with aliases like Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy), Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall), etc. But the post doesn't mention any drugs directly. The phrase "crack his feet" doesn't seem to relate to any of the listed index terms. 

The user might be using "crack" metaphorically, but there's no direct reference to a drug. The word "crack" in this context is about cracking joints, not drugs. The term "Feet" is part of the description, but there's no drug alias associated with feet. 

Since there are no drug-related terms in the post, all detected phrases would fall under "other". However, the post doesn't have any actual drug references. The user might have made a mistake or there's a misunderstanding. But according to the instructions, if no drug is found, it's "other". 

So, the answer should be an empty array because there are no drug references in the post. The phrases "back neck fingers" and "Feet" don't match any index terms. Therefore, the JSON array would be empty.
