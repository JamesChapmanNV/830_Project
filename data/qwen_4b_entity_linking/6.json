Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to moderate social media content for drug-related references. The post provided is about George Floyd's death and mentions a drug overdose. My task is to detect any drug references, link them to the appropriate index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The key part is "drug overdose." Now, I need to check if "overdose" is a drug reference. Looking at the index terms, there's no direct term for "overdose," but maybe "drug overdose" could be linked to a specific substance. However, the index terms list specific drugs, not the act of overdosing. 

Wait, the index terms include things like Codeine, Amphetamine, Fentanyl, etc. The phrase "drug overdose" isn't a specific drug name, so according to the instructions, if the drug isn't in the list, use "other." But the user might be referring to an overdose related to a specific drug. However, in the post, it's just "drug overdose" without specifying which drug. Since the index terms don't have a general term for overdose, I should map "drug overdose" to "other."

But wait, let me check the index terms again. The list includes terms like "Codeine," "Amphetamine," "Fentanyl," etc., but not "overdose." So "drug overdose" isn't a specific drug, so it's "other." However, the post mentions "drug overdose" as a result of using drugs, but the actual drug name isn't specified. Therefore, the matched phrase here is "drug overdose," which isn't in the index terms, so index_term is "other."

Wait, but the example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other. So in this case, "drug overdose" is not a specific drug, so it's "other." So the JSON would be {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "drug overdose"}.

But wait, maybe the user is referring to a specific drug that's not listed. However, the post doesn't specify which drug caused the overdose. The mention of "drug overdose" is a general term. Therefore, the correct index term here is "other."

So the final answer should have one object with index_term "other" and matched_phrase "drug overdose".
