Okay, let's tackle this query. The user posted: "I have a cold. Does anyone have some codeine and sprite they could lend?" 

First, I need to identify any drug-related references here. The main words are "codeine" and "sprite". 

Looking at the index terms, "Codeine" is listed with synonyms like Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy. The phrase "codeine" is directly listed under Codeine, so that's a clear match. 

Now, "sprite" â€“ I need to check if that's a slang term for a drug. From the index terms, I don't see "sprite" listed. The closest might be something like "OTC" or "RX", but "sprite" isn't in the list. The example 3 mentions "xans" as other because it's not listed. So "sprite" here is likely a non-drug term, maybe a brand name for a drink. 

So the only match is "codeine". The answer should be an array with one object: index_term "Codeine" and matched_phrase "codeine".
