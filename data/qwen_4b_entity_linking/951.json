Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "I never had a pair! I need them to redrop". The task is to detect any drug-related references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I need to look for any slang, euphemisms, or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The words here are "pair" and "redrop". Let me check the index terms list. 

Looking through the list, "pair" doesn't immediately ring a bell. But wait, in some contexts, "pair" could be slang for a drug. However, checking the index terms, I don't see "pair" listed. The closest might be "Codeine" with aliases like "Lean", "Purple Drank", "Schoolboy". But "pair" isn't mentioned there. 

Then there's "redrop". Hmm, "redrop" isn't a term I recognize in the index list. The index terms include words like "redrop" in the context of drugs? Let me check again. No, the index terms don't have "redrop". 

Looking at the examples, in Example 3, "xans" was considered "other" because it wasn't a listed term. Similarly, "snow" and "white lines" in Example 4 were "other". So if "pair" and "redrop" aren't in the index terms, they should be marked as "other".

Wait, but maybe "pair" is a slang term for something else. Let me think. In some contexts, "pair" could refer to a pair of drugs, but I don't see that in the index. The index terms are specific, like "Codeine", "Amphetamine", etc. Since "pair" and "redrop" aren't listed, they should be "other".

So the answer would be both phrases linked to "other".
