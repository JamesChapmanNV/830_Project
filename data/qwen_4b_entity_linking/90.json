Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read the post carefully: "Other than the plague, not yet :( gonna crack into my last Raymond chandler finally! Then I'll have read them all I think. & ima read world war z o.o". 

Looking for any slang, euphemisms, or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The main parts here are "the plague" and "Raymond chandler" and "world war z". 

"The plague" is a common euphemism for cocaine, but I need to check if it's in the index terms. Looking through the list, there's no entry for "plague" as a drug. The index terms include things like Codeine, Amphetamine, etc. Since "plague" isn't listed, it should be "other".

Next, "Raymond chandler" refers to the books by Raymond Chandler, which are crime novels. That's not a drug reference. "World War Z" is a movie, also not a drug. The user might be using "o.o" as an emoji, which is just an expression of surprise, not a drug.

So the only possible match is "the plague", which isn't in the index terms. Therefore, it should be categorized as "other". The rest of the post doesn't mention any drugs. 

I need to make sure there are no other phrases. The user mentioned "crack into my last Raymond chandler" â€“ "crack into" might mean reading, not a drug. No other terms here. 

So the final answer should have one entry for "the plague" as "other".
