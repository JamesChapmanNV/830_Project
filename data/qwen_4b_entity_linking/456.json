Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that says: "Dude‚Ä¶. Stop toking the crack pipe and worry about yourself. We did the tough yards and we are relaxing in the glory üòÅ". I need to identify any drug references here and map them to the correct index terms.

First, I'll go through the post word by word. The first part is "Stop toking the crack pipe". The word "toking" is a slang for smoking or using drugs. "Crack pipe" refers to a crack pipe, which is a common tool for smoking crack cocaine. So "crack" here is the drug. Looking at the index terms, "Crack" is not listed directly, but "Crack" is a form of cocaine, and in the index terms, "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" is the metabolite of cocaine. However, the index terms don't have a direct entry for "crack" as a drug. Wait, the index terms list "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" and others, but "crack" is a form of cocaine. However, in the index terms, the only cocaine-related term is "Benzoylecgonine". But the user's task is to check if the drug is in the list. Since "crack" isn't listed as an index term, but "Benzoylecgonine" is the metabolite of cocaine, which is the drug. However, the post is referring to "crack" as the drug. But the index terms don't have a direct entry for "crack" as a drug. Wait, the index terms list "Cocaine" as a metabolite? Let me check again. The index terms list "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the primary metabolite of cocaine. But the drug itself is cocaine. However, the index terms don't have a direct entry for "Cocaine" as an index term. Wait, looking back, the index terms list "Cocaine" is not present. Wait, the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite, but the actual drug is cocaine. However, the user's task is to match phrases to index terms. If the drug is not in the list, use "other". But in this case, "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is not listed. Wait, looking at the index terms again, the only cocaine-related term is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is a metabolite. So if the post refers to "crack", which is cocaine, but the index term for cocaine isn't listed, then we have to check if "crack" is considered as part of the index terms. But in the index terms, "Benzoylecgonine" is the metabolite, not the drug itself. So maybe "crack" is not in the index terms. Therefore, the matched phrase "crack" would be under "other". But wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other. So in this case, "crack" is the drug, but if it's not in the index terms, then it's "other". However, maybe the index terms do have "Cocaine" as a term? Let me check again. The index terms list "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite of cocaine. But the actual drug is cocaine. However, in the index terms, there's no entry for "Cocaine" as an index term. Therefore, "crack" would be "other". But wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" as "other" because it's not in the list. So in this case, "crack" is not in the index terms, so it's "other". However, the user might have intended "crack" as a drug. But according to the index terms provided, "crack" isn't listed. Therefore, the correct index term is "other".

So the matched phrase is "toking" which is slang for smoking drugs, but "toking" is a verb. However, the index terms don't have a term for "toking". But the actual drug here is "crack", which is cocaine. But since "crack" isn't in the index terms, it's "other". Alternatively, maybe "crack" is considered as part of the index terms? Let me check the index terms again. The index terms include "Cocaine" as a metabolite? No, the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite. The actual drug is cocaine, but it's not listed as an index term. Therefore, "crack" is not in the index terms, so it's "other".

So the matched phrase is "crack" which is "other". Also, "toking" is a slang term, but the index terms don't have a term for that. So "toking" would be "other" as well. But the user's task is to detect phrases that refer to illicit drugs. "Toking" is a verb, but the actual drug is "crack". So the main phrase here is "crack pipe", so "crack" is the drug. Therefore, "crack" would be "other" since it's not in the index terms. So the JSON array would have one entry: {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "crack"}.

Wait, but the user's example 4 had "snow" as "other" even though it's not a drug. So in this case, "crack" is a drug, but since it's not in the index terms, it's "other". Therefore, the correct answer is that "crack" is mapped to "other".
