Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to moderate social media content for drug-related references. The post is: "Young Couple Achieves Dream Of Buying Crack House In Slums For $100,000 Over Asking Price". 

First, I need to scan the post for any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs or substances. The main terms here are "Crack House". Now, I need to check if "Crack House" is listed in the index terms. Looking at the list, the only mention related to crack is under "Crack House" as a term for a house where crack is sold or used. Wait, actually, checking the index terms provided, I don't see "Crack House" listed. The index terms include things like Codeine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, etc., but not specifically "Crack House". 

Wait, but "crack" itself is a drug. Let me check the index terms again. The index terms include "Crack House" as a term? Wait, no, looking at the list, the entry for "Crack House" isn't there. The index terms include "Crack House" as a term? Wait, no. Let me check again. The index terms list includes "Crack House" as a term? No, the index terms are all specific chemicals or metabolites. For example, "Crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is a form of cocaine. But in the index terms provided, the only cocaine-related term is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine. However, the term "crack" itself isn't listed in the index terms. 

So, the phrase "Crack House" refers to a house where crack is sold, but the index terms don't have an exact match for "Crack House". However, "crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is a form of cocaine. But in the index terms, the only cocaine-related term is "Benzoylecgonine", which is the metabolite. However, the user's instruction says to link each detected phrase to its matching index term. If the drug isn't in the list, use "other". 

So, "Crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. But is "crack" listed in the index terms? Looking through the list again, I don't see "crack" listed. The index terms include "Cocaine" as a term, but the metabolite is "Benzoylecgonine". However, the user's index terms don't have a direct entry for "crack" as a drug. Therefore, the phrase "Crack House" would be considered as referring to crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. Since "crack" isn't in the index terms, the index term should be "other". 

Wait, but the index terms include "Cocaine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite. However, the term "crack" is a form of cocaine. But the index terms don't have a specific entry for "crack". Therefore, the matched phrase "Crack House" would be linked to "other" because "crack" isn't explicitly listed in the index terms. 

Alternatively, maybe "Crack House" is a term that refers to the drug itself. But since "crack" isn't in the index terms, the correct index term would be "other". So the answer would be {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "Crack House"}.
