Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about NASA's MMS Mission solving a 60-year mystery related to fast magnetic explosions. My task is to check if there are any drug-related references in the post and map them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The post mentions "fast magnetic explosions" and the MMS Mission. The key words here are "magnetic explosions," which sounds scientific, related to space physics. There's no mention of any drugs, substances, or slang terms that could be associated with illicit drugs. 

Looking at the list of index terms, I need to ensure that none of the phrases in the post match any of the drug names or slang. The post doesn't include any words like codeine, amphetamine, cocaine, or other substances listed. The terms "MMS Mission" and "NASA" are unrelated to drugs. 

The example given in the problem statement shows that even if a term isn't on the list, it's categorized as "other." But in this case, there are no terms that refer to drugs. So the correct response would be an empty array since there are no matches. 

I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any possible slang or euphemism. Words like "explosions" might be a stretch, but in the context of a scientific mission, it's clear they're talking about magnetic phenomena, not drugs. Therefore, the JSON array should be empty.
