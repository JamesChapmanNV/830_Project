Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that needs to be moderated for drug-related references. The task is to detect any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs or substances, link them to the appropriate Index Terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read through the post carefully: "Fucke codeine and fuck do you even get cancer, I've had cartons of smokes in my face and I drop this album universe???" 

Looking for drug-related terms. The first part mentions "codeine," which is directly listed in the Index Terms under Codeine. So "codeine" is a clear match. 

Next, there's "smokes." Now, "smokes" can be slang for cigarettes, but in the context of drug use, it might refer to cocaine. However, the Index Terms don't have a specific entry for cocaine. Wait, the Index Terms do include "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the primary metabolite of cocaine. But the user's post says "smokes," which is a bit ambiguous. However, in the example provided (Example 4), "snow" was categorized as "other" even though it's a slang for cocaine. So maybe "smokes" here is considered a slang for cocaine, but since it's not explicitly listed in the Index Terms, it would fall under "other." 

But wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" which was "other" because it's not a listed term. So "smokes" isn't a direct term in the Index Terms, so it should be "other." 

Then there's "album universe," which seems like a reference to a music album, not a drug. So that's not relevant. 

So the detected phrases are "codeine" and "smokes." "Codeine" maps directly to the Index Term "Codeine." "Smokes" isn't listed, so it's "other." 

Wait, but in the example 4, "snow" was "other" even though it's a slang for cocaine. So same logic applies here. Therefore, "smokes" would be "other." 

So the JSON array should have two entries: one for "codeine" and one for "other" with "smokes."
