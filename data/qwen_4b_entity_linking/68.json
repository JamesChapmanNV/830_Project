Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read the post carefully: "Im on ocean drive sippin codeine with the top down 20 grand on me lot of jewelry and a glock 9". 

Looking for words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs or substances. The first thing I notice is "codeine". Checking the index terms, Codeine is listed with synonyms like Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy. The phrase "sippin codeine" directly mentions codeine, so that's a clear match. 

Next, I check if there are any other terms. The rest of the post mentions "20 grand" which might refer to money, but not a drug. "Jewelry" and "glock 9" are items, not drugs. There's no mention of other substances like cocaine, amphetamines, or anything else from the index list. 

So the only match here is "codeine". The index term for codeine is "Codeine", and the matched phrase is "codeine". The user might be referring to codeine as a drug, possibly in a slang way, but since "codeine" is directly listed, it's a valid match. 

I need to make sure there's no other hidden references. "Ocean drive" is a location, "top down" could be a phrase, but nothing related to drugs. The rest are items or money. 

Therefore, the correct JSON array should have one object with index_term "Codeine" and matched_phrase "codeine".
