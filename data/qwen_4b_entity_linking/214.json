Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "I have a interview for a cultivation crew member for a cannabis company wish me luck!". The task is to detect any drug-related references and link them to the index terms.

First, I need to scan the post for any slang, euphemisms, or synonyms for illicit drugs. The post mentions "cannabis company" in the context of a cultivation crew. According to the index terms, "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" is listed. However, the post is about a job interview for a cannabis company, which is legal in many places. The term "cannabis" here refers to the legal plant, not the illicit drug. The index term for marijuana is listed as a non-illicit drug, but the task says to detect illicit drugs. Wait, the index terms include "Marijuana" as the most widely used illicit drug. But in this case, the post is about a cultivation job, which is legal. However, the instruction says to detect any references to illicit drugs. The term "cannabis" in the post could be ambiguous. But according to the index terms, "Marijuana" is listed as an illicit drug. However, the user's post is about a job in a cannabis company, which is legal. But the problem is that the post might be referring to the plant, not the illicit use. However, the task is to detect any references to illicit drugs, so maybe "cannabis" here is considered as the illicit drug. Wait, the index term for marijuana is listed as an illicit drug. So in the post, "cannabis company" is a legal entity, but the term "cannabis" itself is in the index terms as an illicit drug. However, the user's post is about a job in a cannabis company, which is legal. But the task is to detect any drug references, regardless of context. So the phrase "cannabis company" might be a reference to the plant, but the index term is "Marijuana". But the user's post is about a cultivation crew, which is legal. However, the task is to detect any drug-related references. So the word "cannabis" here is part of the company's name, but the index term for marijuana is listed as an illicit drug. Therefore, the matched phrase would be "cannabis" and the index term is "Marijuana". But the user's post is about a job in a legal cannabis company. However, the task says to detect any references to illicit drugs. The problem is that "cannabis" is listed as an illicit drug in the index terms, so even if it's legal in the user's context, the system should still match it. But the example given in the problem shows that "Marijuana" is considered an illicit drug. So in this case, the post has "cannabis", which is in the index term as "Marijuana". Therefore, the matched phrase is "cannabis" and the index term is "Marijuana". However, the user's post is about a job in a cannabis company, which is legal. But the task is to detect any drug references, so the system should still flag "cannabis" as referring to the illicit drug. But maybe the index term for marijuana is considered as the illicit drug, so even if it's legal in some places, the system should still match it. Therefore, the answer would be {"index_term": "Marijuana", "matched_phrase": "cannabis"}.

But wait, the user's post is about a cultivation crew for a cannabis company. The term "cannabis" here is the legal plant, but the index term lists "Marijuana" as an illicit drug. So the system should detect "cannabis" as referring to the illicit drug. However, the example in the problem shows that "cannabis" is in the index terms. Therefore, the correct match is "Marijuana" for "cannabis". So the output would be one entry with index term "Marijuana" and matched phrase "cannabis".
