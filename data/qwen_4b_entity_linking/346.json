Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array. First, I need to read the post carefully.

The post says: "Adults can't purchase heroin for themselves without going to prison or can't chop off their own limbs without being committed. Same thing here. Mental illness needs to be treated, not held up as normal."

Looking for any mentions of drugs or related terms. The first part mentions "heroin". Checking the index terms, heroin is listed under "Morphine" as "MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph". Wait, but heroin isn't directly in the index terms. Let me check again. The index terms include "Morphine" but not heroin. Wait, looking at the list, "Morphine" is listed, but heroin isn't explicitly there. However, the index term for morphine includes "MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph", but heroin is a different drug. Wait, but in the index terms, there's "Heroin" listed? Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the index terms list, the entry for Morphine is: "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph) â€“ The prototypical opioid analgesic used for severe pain but prone to tolerance and dependence." There's no explicit entry for heroin. However, the user's task says to include illegal, RX, OTC, or recreational drugs, using, buying, promoting, encouraging or glorifying drug use. The post mentions "heroin", which is an illicit drug. But in the index terms, there's no specific entry for heroin. The closest might be "Morphine", but that's a different drug. However, the index terms list "Morphine" as a separate entry, but heroin isn't listed. So according to the instructions, if the drug isn't in the list, use "other". 

Wait, but in the example 4, cocaine isn't on the list, so they used "other". So in this case, "heroin" isn't in the index terms, so it should be "other". But wait, the index terms list "Morphine" but not heroin. So the phrase "heroin" would map to "other".

Wait, but let me check again. The user's index terms include "Morphine" but not heroin. So "heroin" is not in the list. Therefore, the matched phrase "heroin" would be "other".

But the post is talking about heroin, but the index terms don't have an entry for heroin. Therefore, the correct index term is "other".

So the only detected phrase here is "heroin", which maps to "other". The rest of the post is about mental illness and doesn't mention any other drugs. So the JSON array should have one entry: {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "heroin"}.

Wait, but let me check again. The user's index terms list "Morphine" but not heroin. So "heroin" is not in the list, so it's "other". Therefore, the answer is one object with index_term "other" and matched_phrase "heroin".
