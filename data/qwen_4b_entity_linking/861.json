Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Car finance from the dealer on a new car is pretty cheap." I need to check if there are any drug-related references here.

First, I'll go through each word and phrase. The post talks about car finance, dealers, new cars, and prices. Words like "car," "finance," "dealer," "new," "cheap" don't seem related to drugs. The index terms list includes drugs like codeine, amphetamine, benzodiazepines, etc. But none of the terms here match any of those. 

I should check if any slang or euphemisms are used. "Finance" could be a stretch, but it's not a drug term. "Cheap" might be a red herring. The example where "snow" was considered "other" because it's not a drug. Similarly, "car finance" isn't a drug reference. 

So, there are no matches. The answer should be an empty array. Wait, but the examples sometimes have "other" when the term isn't on the list. However, in this case, there's no phrase that refers to a drug. So the correct response is an empty JSON array.
