Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "I don't want to be the kind to push someone when their back is turned ðŸ¥´" and wants me to detect any drug-related references.

First, I need to go through the post word by word. The main phrase here is "push someone when their back is turned." The emoji is a face with tears of joy, which doesn't relate to drugs. 

Now, checking the Index Terms list. The key here is to see if any of the phrases in the post match the listed drugs or synonyms. The phrase "push someone when their back is turned" is a metaphor for being confrontational or aggressive. But does any of the Index Terms include synonyms for "push" in a drug context?

Looking through the list, terms like "Codeine" have synonyms like "lean" or "purple drank," but "push" isn't directly listed. The Index Terms include drugs like Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall), but "push" isn't a synonym for those. 

The example given in the problem had "addy" matched to Amphetamine. In this case, the post doesn't have any direct drug names or slang. The phrase "push someone when their back is turned" is more about social behavior, not drug use. 

The emoji is a laughing face, which is unrelated. There's no mention of any drug names, slang, or euphemisms here. So, there are no matches in the Index Terms. Therefore, the correct response is to list "other" for any phrases that don't match. But since there are no actual drug-related phrases, the JSON array should be empty. Wait, but the user's example 3 had "xans" as "other" even though it's not a drug. So if there's no match, the answer would be empty. But the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other. 

In this case, the post doesn't contain any drug-related terms. So the output should be an empty array. But the user's examples show that even if there's no match, you have to list "other" for each phrase. Wait, no. The task says to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. If none are found, then the array is empty. But the user's example 3 had "xans" which wasn't a drug, so it was marked as "other". But in this case, the post has no such terms. So the correct answer is an empty array. However, the user's example 4 had two phrases that were "other", but in this case, there are no phrases to match. So the JSON array should be empty. Therefore, the answer is an empty list.
