Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Omg that sounds like FRAUD The f-word is crack cocaine for a certain type of investor". I need to detect any drug references here.

First, I'll look for slang, euphemisms, or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The word "FRAUD" is in all caps. Wait, in the context of drug references, "FRAUD" could be a slang term. Let me check the index terms. Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see "FRAUD" listed. But maybe "crack cocaine" is mentioned. Wait, "crack cocaine" is a specific term. Let me check the index terms. The index term for cocaine is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite. But the post says "crack cocaine", which is a form of cocaine. However, in the index terms, "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" is listed, but cocaine isn't directly listed. Wait, the index terms include "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite of cocaine. But the post is referring to "crack cocaine" as a substance. Since "crack cocaine" is a form of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is not directly listed. Wait, looking back at the index terms, the entry for cocaine is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite. But the actual drug is cocaine. However, the user's task is to match the detected phrase to the index term. If the phrase is "crack cocaine", but there's no index term for that, then it would be "other". But wait, the index term for cocaine is not listed as a separate entry. Let me check again. The index terms include "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite, but the actual drug is cocaine. However, in the index terms, there's no direct entry for cocaine. The user's task says if the drug is not in the list, use "other". So if the phrase is "crack cocaine", which is a form of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine isn't listed, then it would be "other". However, the example given in the problem includes "codeine" with "lean" and "codeine". So in this case, the phrase "crack cocaine" is a drug, but the index term for cocaine isn't listed. Wait, the index term for cocaine is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite, not the drug itself. So the actual drug is cocaine, but the index term for the metabolite is listed. Therefore, if the phrase is "crack cocaine", which is a form of cocaine, but the index term for the drug isn't listed, then the correct index term would be "other". However, the user might be expecting that "crack cocaine" is a form of cocaine, but since the index term for cocaine isn't listed, it's "other". Alternatively, maybe "crack cocaine" is not on the list, so it's "other". So the detected phrases here are "FRAUD" and "crack cocaine". But "FRAUD" is not in the index terms, so "other". However, the user's example 4 shows that "snow" and "white lines" are "other". So "FRAUD" is not a drug term, so "other". "Crack cocaine" is a drug, but the index term for cocaine is not listed. Wait, looking back, the index term for cocaine is not present. The index terms list "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite, not the drug itself. So if the phrase is "crack cocaine", which is a form of cocaine, but the index term for the drug is not listed, then it's "other". Therefore, both "FRAUD" and "crack cocaine" would be "other". But the user's example 3 has "xans" which is not in the list, so "other". So in this case, the post has two phrases: "FRAUD" and "crack cocaine". Both would be "other". So the JSON array would have two entries, both with index_term "other" and matched phrases "FRAUD" and "crack cocaine".
