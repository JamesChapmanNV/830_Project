Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Says it all with only 4 RT'S Shame for him and his family". I need to check for any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look at each word or phrase. The post mentions "RT'S". RT is an abbreviation for "retweet", which is a social media term. The user is talking about retweets, but there's no mention of drugs here. The second part is "Shame for him and his family", which is just a statement about someone's actions, not related to drugs. 

Looking at the index terms list, I need to see if any of the terms match. The phrases "RT'S" don't correspond to any of the listed index terms. The other part of the post is just a statement without any drug-related words. 

So, there are no drug references in this post. The answer should be an empty array since there are no matches. The user might be testing if I can recognize that there's no drug mention here. I need to make sure I don't include any false positives. The example where "snow" was considered "other" because it's not a drug, but in this case, "RT'S" is just a social media term. Therefore, the correct response is an empty JSON array.
