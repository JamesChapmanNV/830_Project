Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Noxolo I was about to sleep you knowðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ you just had to crack me up like thisâ€¦ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚". I need to check for any drug-related references here.

First, I'll go through each word and phrase. The post starts with "Noxolo", which might be a name or a slang. Then "I was about to sleep" â€“ "sleep" is a common word, but not a drug. The next part is "you just had to crack me up like thisâ€¦". "Crack me up" is an idiom meaning to make someone laugh. The emojis are just expressions, not drug references. 

Looking at the index terms, I need to see if any of the phrases match. The key is to check for slang, euphemisms, or synonyms for drugs. The words here are "sleep", "crack me up", which don't align with any of the listed index terms. The example 3 had "xans" which was "other" because it wasn't listed. Similarly, "snow" in example 4 was "other". 

So in this case, there's no mention of any drugs. The post is about someone trying to make the other person laugh. Therefore, there are no matches. The answer should be an empty array.
