Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that needs to be moderated for drug-related references. The task is to detect any words or phrases that refer to illicit drugs or substances, link them to the appropriate index term, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read the post carefully: "Birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight. Percocet & codeine please don't take my life 🙏🏻". 

Looking at the first part, "Birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight." That seems like a lyric reference, maybe a song title or a metaphor. But I don't see any drug references here. The second part is "Percocet & codeine please don't take my life 🙏🏻". 

Now, checking the index terms. "Percocet" is a brand name for oxycodone, which is a semi-synthetic opioid. The index term for oxycodone is "Oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet, Hillbilly Heroin)". So "Percocet" would map to "Oxycodone".

Then "codeine" is explicitly listed in the index terms under "Codeine (Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy)". So "codeine" directly maps to "Codeine".

Are there any other phrases? The rest of the post is a plea, not a drug reference. The emojis don't count. So the matched phrases are "Percocet" and "codeine".

Now, checking if there are any other possible terms. "Percocet" is a specific drug, so it's covered. "Codeine" is also covered. The rest of the text doesn't mention any other drugs. 

So the JSON array should have two entries: one for "Oxycodone" with "Percocet" and another for "Codeine" with "codeine".
