Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "She want me to quit that lean, baby I can't quit that lean, put a 💍 around codeine". I need to detect any drug references here.

First, I'll go through the post word by word. The first mention is "lean". Looking at the index terms, Codeine has aliases like "Lean" and "Purple Drank". So "lean" maps to Codeine. Then there's "codeine" directly, which is listed under Codeine as well. The 💍 is a heart symbol, but the context is around codeine, so maybe it's a slang or a symbol related to the drug. However, the index terms don't have a specific term for the heart symbol in this context. The example 3 had "xans" which was "other" because it wasn't listed. Since "codeine" is explicitly in the list, the heart symbol might not be a drug term. So the matched phrases are "lean" and "codeine", both under Codeine. The rest of the post is about wanting to quit, which is context but not a drug term. So the JSON should have two entries for Codeine with "lean" and "codeine".
