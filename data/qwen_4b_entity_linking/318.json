Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "codeine crazy is one of my favorite future songs üôåüèΩ". I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look for words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The word "codeine" is explicitly listed in the index terms under Codeine. The phrase "crazy" might be a slang term, but I need to check if it's associated with a drug. However, in the given index terms, "crazy" isn't listed. The example given in the problem statement includes "lean" and "codeine" as matches. 

Wait, the user's post has "codeine" and "crazy". The index terms include Codeine, so "codeine" is a direct match. But "crazy" isn't listed in the index terms. However, the example in the problem shows that "codeine" is matched even if there's a slang term. But in this case, "crazy" isn't a drug term. Let me check the index terms again. 

Looking at the list, "crazy" isn't mentioned. The only drug-related terms are the ones listed. So "codeine" is a direct match. The word "crazy" might be a slang term for something else, but since it's not in the index terms, it should be marked as "other". 

Wait, but the user's example 3 has "xans" which is not in the list, so it's "other". Similarly, in example 4, "snow" is "other". So in this case, "codeine" is a direct match, and "crazy" isn't a drug term. So the correct matches would be "codeine" and "crazy" as "other". But wait, the user's example 1 has "lean" and "codeine" both mapped to Codeine. So in this case, the phrase "codeine crazy" would have "codeine" as a match, and "crazy" as "other". 

But wait, is "crazy" a slang for a drug? Let me think. In some contexts, "crazy" might be slang for a drug, but according to the index terms provided, there's no entry for "crazy". So the correct approach is to check each word against the index terms. 

So "codeine" is a direct match. "Crazy" is not in the index terms, so it's "other". Therefore, the JSON array should have one entry for "codeine" and another for "crazy" as "other".
