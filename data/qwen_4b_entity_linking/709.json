Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Chillin in the ER and in horrible pain and this place is packed. FML. I'm just sitting here in a wheelchair bawling. I'm gonna crack fr". I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll go through each word and phrase. The post mentions "ER" which is Emergency Room, but that's not a drug. "Horrible pain" could be related to opioids, but "pain" alone isn't a drug. "Wheelchair" is just a piece of equipment. "Bawling" is crying, not a drug. "Crack fr" – "fr" might be a typo or slang. Wait, "crack" can refer to crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. But is "crack" in the list? Let me check the index terms. Looking through the list, "Crack" isn't explicitly listed. The closest might be "Methamphetamine" or "Cocaine", but "crack" is a form of cocaine. However, in the index terms, "Cocaine" is listed as "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate) – The primary metabolite of cocaine measured in urine drug testing." So "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is "Cocaine". Wait, but the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other because they aren't on the list. So if "crack" isn't explicitly listed, maybe it's "other". But wait, the index terms include "Cocaine" as a term. However, the post says "crack fr". "Crack" is a slang for cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is "Cocaine". However, in the example 3, "xans" was "other" because it's not in the list. So if "crack" is a slang for cocaine, but the index term is "Cocaine", then "crack" would map to "Cocaine". Wait, but the index terms list "Cocaine" as a separate entry. Let me check again. The index terms include "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" – no, wait, no. Wait, looking back, the index terms for Amphetamine are listed as "Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall) – A central nervous system stimulant prescribed for ADHD that is frequently abused for euphoria and wakefulness." So "Speed", "Bennies", "Adderall" are synonyms for amphetamine. Then "Cocaine" is listed as "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate) – The primary metabolite of cocaine measured in urine drug testing." So "Cocaine" is the index term. But "crack" is a form of cocaine. However, the index term is "Cocaine", so if the phrase is "crack", does that map to "Cocaine"? But in the example 4, "snow" was "other" because it's not on the list. So if "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term is "Cocaine", then "crack" would be under "Cocaine". However, the user's example 3 had "xans" as "other" because it's not in the list. Wait, but "xans" could be a slang for Xanax, which is a benzodiazepine. But in the index terms, "Bromazolam (XLI-268, Fake Xanax) – A designer benzodiazepine sold illicitly that mimics the sedative effects of alprazolam." So "Xanax" is a different drug. But "xans" is not in the list, so it's "other". Therefore, if "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term is "Cocaine", then "crack" would map to "Cocaine". However, the user's example 4 had "snow" as "other" even though it's not a drug. So maybe "crack" is a drug, but the index term is "Cocaine", so "crack" would be under "Cocaine". But I need to check if "crack" is in the list. Wait, the index terms don't have "crack" as a term. The index term for cocaine is "Cocaine", but "crack" is a slang term for cocaine. However, in the index terms, "Cocaine" is listed as a separate entry. Therefore, "crack" would map to "Cocaine". But in the example 4, "snow" was "other" because it's not in the list. So if "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index term is "Cocaine", then "crack" would be under "Cocaine". However, the user might have intended "crack" as a drug, but the index term is "Cocaine". Therefore, the correct mapping would be "Cocaine" for "crack". But wait, the index term for cocaine is "Cocaine", but "crack" is a form of cocaine. Therefore, "crack" would be under "Cocaine". However, in the example 3, "xans" was "other" because it's not in the list. But "xans" could be a slang for Xanax, which is a benzodiazepine. However, the index term for Bromazolam is listed, but not Xanax. So "xans" is not in the list, so it's "other". Therefore, "crack" is a form of cocaine, so it's under "Cocaine". But the user's example 4 had "snow" as "other", which is not a drug. So in this case, "crack" is a drug, so it should be under "Cocaine". Therefore, the matched phrase "crack" would map to "Cocaine". However, the user's example 1 had "lean" and "codeine" both mapped to "Codeine". So in this case, "crack" would be under "Cocaine". Therefore, the answer would be {"index_term": "Cocaine", "matched_phrase": "crack"}.

But wait, the user's example 4 had "snow" as "other" even though it's not a drug. So if "crack" is a drug, then it should be under "Cocaine". But is "crack" considered a drug here? Yes, crack is a form of cocaine. Therefore, the correct index term is "Cocaine".
