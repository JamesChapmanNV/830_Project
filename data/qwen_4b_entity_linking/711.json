Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about drug usage in Pittsburgh, mentioning meth, heroin, and crack. The task is to detect any drug references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I need to go through each word or phrase in the post. The post says: "Its for some reason one of the more popular drugs in Pittsburgh too?? Meth has been blowing up here last few years, but I'd say in order 1. heroin, 2. Crack, 3. Meth for the big bad hard drugs in order of most used."

Looking at the drugs mentioned: "Meth," "heroin," and "Crack." Now, checking the index terms list. 

Meth is listed as "Methamphetamine (Crystal Meth, Ice, Desoxyn)" so "Meth" would map to Methamphetamine. Heroin is directly listed as "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" but wait, the index term for heroin is under Morphine? Wait, no, looking back, the index terms include "Heroin" as a separate entry? Wait, let me check the list again.

Wait, the index terms list includes "Methamphetamine" and "Heroin" is not explicitly listed. Wait, looking at the index terms, "Morphine" is listed, but heroin is a derivative. Wait, the index terms list has "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" but heroin is a separate drug. However, in the index terms, is there an entry for heroin? Let me check again.

Looking through the list: The index terms include "Heroin" as a separate entry? Wait, no. Wait, the index terms list includes "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" but heroin is not explicitly listed. Wait, but in the example given, "Codeine" has synonyms like "Lean" and "Purple Drank". So, maybe heroin is considered under Morphine? Or is there a separate entry?

Wait, looking again, the index terms list includes "Heroin" as a separate entry? Let me check. No, the user provided the list, and I need to check if "Heroin" is in the list. Looking through the list, the entry for Morphine is listed, but heroin is not directly listed. Wait, the index terms list includes "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" but heroin is a different drug. However, in the index terms, there's no explicit entry for heroin. Wait, but in the example given, "Codeine" is linked to "Lean" and "codeine". So, if the post mentions "heroin", is there an index term for heroin?

Wait, the index terms list includes "Heroin" as a separate entry? Let me check again. The user provided the list. Let me scan through the index terms:

Looking through the list, there's an entry for "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" but not for heroin. However, heroin is a different drug. Wait, but in the index terms, "Heroin" is not listed. Wait, the user's index terms list does not have an explicit entry for heroin. So, if the post mentions "heroin", since it's not in the index terms, we have to use "other".

Wait, but wait, the index terms list includes "Morphine" but not heroin. However, heroin is a different drug. So, "heroin" would not be in the index terms list, so it would be "other". Similarly, "Crack" is cocaine, but the index terms list has "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine. But "Crack" is a form of cocaine, so maybe "Crack" is considered as cocaine. However, in the index terms list, "Cocaine" is not explicitly listed. Wait, the index terms list includes "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" but not cocaine. Wait, the index terms list has "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine, but the drug itself is cocaine. So, if the post mentions "Crack", which is a form of cocaine, but since the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine, would "Crack" be considered "other"?

Wait, the user's index terms list includes "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" as the metabolite of cocaine, but the drug itself is cocaine. However, the index terms list doesn't have an entry for "Cocaine". So, if the post mentions "Crack", which is a form of cocaine, but since the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine, then "Crack" would be "other".

But wait, the example given in the user's prompt includes "Codeine" with synonyms like "Lean" and "Purple Drank". So, if the post mentions "heroin", which is not in the index terms list, then it would be "other". Similarly, "Crack" is a form of cocaine, but since the index terms don't have an entry for cocaine, it would be "other".

But wait, looking back, the index terms list includes "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine. However, the actual drug is cocaine. But the index terms don't have an entry for cocaine. Therefore, "Crack" would be considered "other".

So, in the post, "heroin" and "Crack" are mentioned. Since they are not in the index terms list, they would be "other". However, "Meth" is explicitly listed as "Methamphetamine (Crystal Meth, Ice, Desoxyn)", so "Meth" would be "Methamphetamine".

So, the matched phrases would be "Meth" → "Methamphetamine", "heroin" → "other", "Crack" → "other".

But wait, let me check again. The user's index terms list includes "Heroin" as a separate entry? Let me check again. The index terms list includes "Morphine (MS Contin, Miss Emma, Morph)" but not heroin. So, "heroin" is not in the index terms. Therefore, "heroin" is "other".

Similarly, "Crack" is a form of cocaine, but since the index terms don't have an entry for cocaine, it's "other".

So the JSON output would be:

[
  {"index_term": "Methamphetamine", "matched_phrase": "Meth"},
  {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "heroin"},
  {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "Crack"}
]

But wait, the user's example 4 shows that "snow" and "white lines" are "other" even though they are not drugs. So, in this case, "heroin" and "Crack" are not in the index terms, so they are "other". However, "Meth" is in the index terms as Methamphetamine, so that's correct.

So the final answer should have three entries: Meth as Methamphetamine, heroin as other, Crack as other.
