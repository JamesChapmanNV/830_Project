Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Or it's george floyd, and his dealer is hereðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜†". I need to check for any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look for any slang, euphemisms, or terms that might refer to illicit drugs. The mention of "George Floyd" is a person, so that's probably not relevant. The word "dealer" could be a hint, but in this context, it's referring to a person who sells drugs, not the drug itself. The post doesn't use any specific drug names or slang terms listed in the index terms. 

Looking at the index terms, there's "Codeine" with aliases like "lean" and "purple drank", but "george floyd" isn't listed. "Dealer" isn't a drug term in the list either. The emojis are just expressions and don't relate to drugs. 

So, there are no direct matches to the index terms. The phrase "dealer" might be a reference to someone involved in drug dealing, but the task is to detect drug references, not people. Since there's no specific drug name or slang here, the correct response would be "other" for any matched phrases. However, since there are no actual drug terms, maybe there are none. Wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" which wasn't in the list, so it was "other". But in this case, "dealer" isn't a drug term. So perhaps there are no matches. But the user's example 4 had "snow" and "white lines" as other. 

Wait, the task says to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. "Dealer" is a person, not the drug. So maybe there's no match here. Therefore, the JSON array would be empty. But the user's example 3 had "xans" which was "other". But in this case, the post doesn't have any drug terms. So the answer is an empty array. But the user's example 4 had two entries. However, in this case, the post doesn't have any drug terms. So the correct answer is no matches. Therefore, the JSON array is empty.
