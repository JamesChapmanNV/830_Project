Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Of the molly and codeine that's my medication i just killed my first rapper it's a celebration ;b". I need to identify any drug references here and map them to the correct index terms.

First, I'll break down the post sentence by sentence. The first part is "Of the molly and codeine that's my medication". "Molly" is a slang term for MDMA, which is listed under the index terms as MDMA. So "molly" should map to "MDMA". Then "codeine" is directly listed under the Codeine index term. 

Next part: "i just killed my first rapper it's a celebration ;b". The phrase "killed my first rapper" is likely metaphorical, but I need to check if "killed" refers to any drug-related term. However, in this context, it's probably not a drug reference. The semicolon and "b" at the end are just emojis or internet slang, not drug terms. 

So the detected phrases are "molly" and "codeine". Mapping them to the index terms: "molly" is MDMA, and "codeine" is Codeine. The other parts of the sentence don't refer to any drugs listed. Therefore, the JSON array should include these two entries.
