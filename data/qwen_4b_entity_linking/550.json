Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Morrison in deep with this crack head is really very telling." I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll break down the sentence. The key words are "crack head." From the index terms, I know that "crack" refers to cocaine. The term "crack head" is a slang term for someone addicted to cocaine. Looking at the list, cocaine's index term is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine. However, the index term for cocaine itself isn't listed directly. Wait, checking the index terms again, the entry for cocaine is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate) – The primary metabolite of cocaine measured in urine drug testing." So "crack" refers to cocaine, but the index term is Benzoylecgonine. However, the user's example 4 had "snow" as "other" because it wasn't on the list. But "crack" is a slang for cocaine, which is an illicit drug. Wait, the index terms include "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" but no, looking back, the index terms for cocaine are under Benzoylecgonine. Wait, no, in the index terms list, there's an entry for "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)"? Wait no, checking the list again: the index terms include "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate) – The primary metabolite of cocaine measured in urine drug testing." So the actual drug is cocaine, but the index term is Benzoylecgonine. But in the example 1, "lean" is mapped to Codeine. So maybe "crack" is a slang for cocaine, and the index term for cocaine is not directly listed. Wait, the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine. Wait, looking again: the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite of cocaine, but the drug itself is cocaine. However, the user's task is to detect any reference to an illicit drug, including slang, euphemisms, etc. So "crack" is a slang term for cocaine. But in the index terms, is there an entry for cocaine? Let me check again.

Looking through the index terms list: the entry for cocaine is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate) – The primary metabolite of cocaine measured in urine drug testing." So the index term here is Benzoylecgonine, which is the metabolite, not the drug itself. But the task is to detect the drug name. However, the user's example 1 had "lean" mapped to Codeine, which is a slang term for codeine. So maybe "crack" is a slang term for cocaine, and the index term for cocaine is not present. Wait, but the index terms list "Cocaine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)"? Wait no, looking back, the index terms list "Amphetamine (Speed, Bennies, Adderall)" as an index term. Then, "Cocaine" isn't listed as an index term. So "crack" is a slang term for cocaine, which is an illicit drug. But the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine. However, in the index terms, "Benzoylecgonine" is the metabolite, but the drug is cocaine. But the user's task is to link the detected phrase to the index term. So if "crack" refers to cocaine, but the index term for cocaine is not present, then the index term would be "other". Wait, but the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite. But the actual drug is cocaine. However, in the example 4, "snow" was mapped to "other" because it wasn't on the list. So if "crack" is a slang for cocaine, but the index term for cocaine isn't listed, then "crack" would be "other". Wait, but the index terms don't have an entry for cocaine. The only entry related to cocaine is Benzoylecgonine, which is the metabolite. So the phrase "crack" refers to the drug cocaine, but the index term is not directly listed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if the drug is not in the list, use "other". Therefore, "crack" would be "other". However, in the example 1, "lean" is mapped to Codeine, even though "lean" is a slang term for codeine. So maybe "crack" is a slang term for cocaine, and since cocaine is not listed as an index term, but Benzoylecgonine is the metabolite, but the actual drug is cocaine. But the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine. Therefore, the correct index term would be "other". But wait, the index terms list "Benzoylecgonine" as the metabolite, but the drug is cocaine. However, the task is to detect the drug or substance. So "crack" refers to cocaine, which is an illicit drug. But since the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine, the index term would be "other". Therefore, the matched phrase "crack" would be mapped to "other". But wait, the user's example 3 had "xans" mapped to "other" because it wasn't on the list. So in this case, "crack" is a slang term for cocaine, which is an illicit drug. But since the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine, the answer would be "other". Therefore, the JSON array would have {"index_term": "other", "matched_phrase": "crack"}.
