Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Ain't nothing important to me except codeine over ice noww". I need to detect any drug references here.

First, I'll look for keywords that might refer to illicit drugs. The phrase "codeine over ice" stands out. From the index terms, Codeine is listed with synonyms like "Lean", "Purple Drank", "Schoolboy". The post mentions "codeine", which is directly in the index term list. The "over ice" part might be a slang reference, but I need to check if "ice" is a drug term here. Wait, in some contexts, "ice" refers to methamphetamine, but in the index terms, Methamphetamine is listed as "Crystal Meth, Ice, Desoxyn". However, the user's post specifically says "codeine over ice". Since "ice" here is likely referring to the method of consumption (like adding ice to a drink), but maybe in slang, "ice" could be a euphemism for meth. However, the main phrase here is "codeine", which is directly listed. The "over ice" might not be a drug term but a way of saying it's being consumed. But I need to check if "ice" is in the index terms. Looking at the list, Methamphetamine is associated with "ice", but the post is about codeine. So "ice" here might not be a drug term. Therefore, the only match is "codeine". The user's example 1 had "lean" and "codeine" both matching. So in this case, "codeine" is the only phrase that directly maps to an index term. The "over ice" part might be a red herring, but since "ice" isn't listed as a drug term here, it's probably not part of the match. So the JSON should have one entry for "codeine" with the matched phrase "codeine over ice"? Wait, but the task says to detect every word or phrase that refers to a drug. "Codeine over ice" is a phrase, but maybe "ice" is part of the slang. However, in the index terms, "ice" is under Methamphetamine. But the post is about codeine. So maybe "codeine" is the only term here. Alternatively, if "ice" is part of the slang for codeine, but I don't see that in the index terms. The example given in the problem had "lean" and "codeine" as separate entries. So in this case, the phrase "codeine over ice" would have "codeine" as the matched phrase. The "over ice" might not be a drug term, so it's just "codeine". Therefore, the correct JSON is {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "codeine over ice"}? Wait, but the example 1 had "lean" and "codeine" as separate entries. So maybe "codeine over ice" is considered as the phrase. But the user's example 1 had "lean" and "codeine" as separate phrases. So in this case, the phrase "codeine over ice" is one phrase that refers to codeine. Therefore, the correct entry is {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "codeine over ice"}.

Wait, but the index term for codeine includes "Lean", "Purple Drank", "Schoolboy". The phrase here is "codeine over ice". Since "codeine" is in the index terms, the matched phrase is "codeine over ice". But maybe "ice" is part of the slang. However, in the index terms, "ice" is under Methamphetamine. So unless "ice" here is part of a different slang for codeine, which I don't think is in the list. Therefore, the only match is "codeine over ice" as the phrase. But the example 1 had "lean" and "codeine" as separate phrases. So in this case, the user's post has "codeine over ice", which is a phrase that refers to codeine. Therefore, the correct JSON would have one entry with "codeine" as the index term and "codeine over ice" as the matched phrase. Alternatively, maybe "over ice" is a way of saying it's being consumed, but the main term is "codeine". So the answer should be one object with codeine and the matched phrase as "codeine over ice".
