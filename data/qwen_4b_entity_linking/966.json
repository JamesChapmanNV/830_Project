Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a social media post: "Bankroll Bird - Codeine & Adderall" along with some emojis and a hashtag. My task is to detect any drug references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I'll look at the post. The main phrase here is "Codeine & Adderall". I need to check each part. 

Starting with "Codeine". Looking at the index terms, Codeine is listed with synonyms like Lean, Purple Drank, Schoolboy. So "Codeine" directly maps to the index term "Codeine".

Next is "Adderall". According to the index terms, Amphetamine is listed with aliases like Speed, Bennies, Adderall. So "Adderall" is a synonym for Amphetamine. Therefore, the index term here should be "Amphetamine".

I need to make sure there are no other phrases. The rest of the post includes emojis and a hashtag, which don't relate to drugs. The hashtag #RIPPrince is just a tribute and not a drug reference. 

So the two matched phrases are "Codeine" and "Adderall", which correspond to "Codeine" and "Amphetamine" respectively. No other terms are present. The answer should be an array with these two entries.
