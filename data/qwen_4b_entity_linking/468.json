Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "Fentanyl Floyd died of overdose. Get over it." I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll scan the post for any words or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The word "Fentanyl" is clearly a drug listed in the index terms. The index term for Fentanyl is "Fentanyl" itself. Then there's "Floyd" which is a person's name, so that's not a drug reference. The rest of the sentence is about an overdose, which is related to Fentanyl but the phrase "died of overdose" is a consequence, not the drug name. 

So the only matched phrase here is "Fentanyl". Checking the index terms, Fentanyl is listed with its own entry. Therefore, the JSON should have one object with index_term "Fentanyl" and matched_phrase "Fentanyl". 

I need to make sure there's no other possible references. "Get over it" is just a phrase and not a drug term. No other words in the post match any of the index terms. So the final answer should be the one entry for Fentanyl.
