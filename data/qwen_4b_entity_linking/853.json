Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about the Women's March events in Cleveland and NYC. My task is to check if there are any drug-related references in the post and map them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The post mentions "Women's March Cleveland, October 2, 2021." There's no mention of any drugs, substances, or slang related to illicit drugs. The content is purely about a social event and doesn't include any terms that would fall under the drug-related index terms provided. 

I need to make sure I didn't miss any possible hidden references. Words like "snow" or "white lines" might be tricky, but in this context, they're part of a metaphor or a reference to the event's activities, not drugs. The example given in the user's prompt where "snow" was considered "other" because it's not a drug, so similarly here, there are no drug terms.

Since there are no detected drug-related phrases, the correct response is an empty array. The user's examples show that when there are no matches, the output is an empty list. So, the final answer should be an empty JSON array as per the instructions.
