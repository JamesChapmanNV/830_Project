Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post about CBD oil and THC. First, I need to check if there are any drug-related references in the post. The post mentions "CBD oil" and "THC". 

Looking at the index terms, CBD is listed as a non-intoxicating cannabinoid, so "CBD oil" would map to "CBD". However, the post also mentions "THC", which is explicitly listed as "Marijuana" in the index terms. But wait, the index term for THC is under Marijuana. However, the post says that anything containing THC is a no-no. So "THC" here is a reference to the illicit drug, so it should be linked to "Marijuana".

But wait, the index terms list "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" as the term. So "THC" is part of marijuana, so the matched phrase "THC" would be under "Marijuana". However, the user's post is talking about CBD oil which doesn't have THC, but then mentions that anything with THC is a problem. So the post is warning about THC. 

So in the post, the phrases "CBD oil" and "THC" are mentioned. "CBD oil" is from the cannabis plant but doesn't contain THC. But the post is saying that anything with THC is a no-no. So the actual drug references here are "THC", which is part of marijuana. Therefore, "THC" should be linked to "Marijuana". 

But wait, the index term for THC is under "Marijuana", so "THC" would map to "Marijuana". However, in the example provided, "THC" is not in the list, but in the index terms, "Marijuana" is listed. So the correct index term for "THC" would be "Marijuana". 

But wait, the index terms list "Marijuana" as the term. So "THC" is a component of marijuana, so the matched phrase "THC" would be under "Marijuana". 

So the post has two phrases: "CBD oil" and "THC". "CBD oil" is from cannabis, but the index term for CBD is "CBD", so "CBD oil" would be "CBD". But the post is saying that CBD is fine because it doesn't have THC. However, the user is mentioning "THC" as a no-no. So the actual drug references here are "THC", which is part of marijuana. Therefore, "THC" is linked to "Marijuana".

Wait, but the index terms list "Marijuana" as the term. So "THC" is a component of marijuana, so the matched phrase "THC" would be under "Marijuana". 

But the post is talking about CBD oil, which is from cannabis but doesn't have THC. However, the user is warning about anything containing THC. So the actual drug reference here is "THC", which is part of marijuana. Therefore, the correct index term for "THC" is "Marijuana". 

So the JSON should have two entries: one for "CBD" and one for "Marijuana". But wait, the post says "CBD oil which is from the cannabis plant is fine as it does not contain THC." So "CBD oil" is a reference to CBD, which is in the index terms. So "CBD oil" would be "CBD". Then "THC" is a reference to marijuana. 

So the answer should be two entries: {"index_term": "CBD", "matched_phrase": "CBD oil"} and {"index_term": "Marijuana", "matched_phrase": "THC"}.

Wait, but the index term for CBD is "CBD", so "CBD oil" is a phrase that refers to CBD. The index term for THC is under "Marijuana", so "THC" is a component of marijuana. Therefore, the correct mapping is:

- "CBD oil" → "CBD"
- "THC" → "Marijuana"

So the JSON array would have those two entries.
