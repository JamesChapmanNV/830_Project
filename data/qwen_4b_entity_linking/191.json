Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post that mentions "Codeine Views" in the context of a music blog and hip hop. The task is to detect any drug-related references and link them to the appropriate index terms.

First, I need to look for any words or phrases that could refer to illicit drugs or substances. The post says "Codeine Views". From the index terms, Codeine is listed with synonyms like "Lean", "Purple Drank", "Schoolboy". The phrase "Codeine Views" here is likely referring to the drug codeine, as "views" might be a slang term for using or consuming it. But wait, "views" in this context could be a play on words. However, in the example given, "lean" was directly linked to codeine. So "Codeine Views" might be a creative way to refer to codeine use. But the exact phrase "Codeine Views" isn't in the index terms. However, "Codeine" itself is in the index terms. The user's post mentions "Codeine" explicitly, so that's a direct match. The word "Views" here might be a slang term, but since it's not in the index terms, it would be "other". But the main term here is "Codeine", which is in the list. So the matched phrase would be "Codeine", and the index term is Codeine. The "Views" part might not be a drug reference, so it's probably not included. Wait, the example in the user's prompt had "lean" and "codeine" both linked. So in this case, the post mentions "Codeine" explicitly, so that's a direct match. The "Views" part might be a hashtag or a creative term, but not a drug reference. Therefore, the only match is "Codeine" with the index term Codeine. So the JSON array should have one object with index_term "Codeine" and matched_phrase "Codeine". But wait, the post says "Codeine Views", so maybe "Views" is part of the phrase. But according to the task, we need to detect every word or phrase that refers to a drug. If "Views" isn't a drug term, then only "Codeine" is the match. However, the user's example had "lean" and "codeine" both in the post. So in this case, the phrase "Codeine Views" would have "Codeine" as the matched phrase. The "Views" part might not be a drug term. Therefore, the correct output is one object with "Codeine" as the index term and "Codeine" as the matched phrase. But the user's example included "lean" and "codeine" in the same post. So the answer here is just the "Codeine" part. Therefore, the JSON array should have one entry.
