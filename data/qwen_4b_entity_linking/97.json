Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post: "He's got scissors on his left foot! This dude be doing some hard crack." I need to detect any drug-related references here.

First, I'll look for slang or phrases that might refer to illicit drugs. The first part mentions "scissors on his left foot." Hmm, "scissors" isn't a drug term I recognize. Maybe it's a metaphor or a typo? But I should check the list of index terms. The index terms include things like Codeine, Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, etc. "Scissors" doesn't seem to match any of them. 

Next part: "hard crack." Wait, "hard crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine. Let me check the index terms. Yes, under "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" it's listed as the most widely used illicit drug. But wait, "crack" is a form of cocaine, which is a different drug. However, the index terms don't have a specific entry for cocaine. The closest is "Benzoylecgonine (BZE, Ecgonine benzoate)" which is the metabolite of cocaine. But the user's task is to link to the index terms provided. Since "crack" is a form of cocaine, but the index terms don't have a direct entry for cocaine, maybe it's considered "other"? Wait, the index terms do have "Marijuana" but not cocaine. However, the example in the user's prompt shows that if the drug isn't in the list, use "other". 

Wait, looking back at the index terms, there's no entry for cocaine. The only related term is Benzoylecgonine, which is a metabolite, not the drug itself. So "crack" would be a slang for cocaine, which isn't listed. Therefore, the matched phrase "hard crack" would be "other". 

So in the post, "hard crack" is a reference to crack cocaine, which isn't in the index terms. Therefore, the index term should be "other". The "scissors" part doesn't refer to a drug, so it's "other" as well. But wait, the user's example 4 shows that "snow" and "white lines" are considered "other" even though they might be references to something else. So in this case, "scissors" and "hard crack" would both be "other". 

But wait, the user's instruction says to detect every word or phrase that refers to an illicit drug. "Hard crack" is definitely a drug reference. Since cocaine isn't in the index terms, it's "other". "Scissors" isn't a drug term, so that's "other" as well. So the JSON array would have two entries: one for "scissors" and one for "hard crack", both with index term "other". 

But wait, the example 3 shows "xans" is "other" because it's not in the list. Similarly, "hard crack" isn't in the index terms, so it's "other". Therefore, the correct answer is two entries with "other" for both "scissors" and "hard crack".
