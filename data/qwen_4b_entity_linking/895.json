Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the index terms, and return a JSON array. 

First, I need to read the post carefully: "PAS only concerned on the name itself, they the one loudly asked for arak ban in malaysia but now so damn quiet like a mice". 

Looking for any words or phrases that could refer to illicit drugs. The main words here are "arak" and "mice". 

Now, checking the index terms. "Arak" is a type of spirit, but I need to check if it's listed. Looking through the index terms, I don't see "arak" listed. The closest might be "other" since it's not in the provided list. 

Then "mice" â€“ that's a slang term for methamphetamine, right? Wait, in the index terms, there's "Methamphetamine" with synonyms like "Crystal Meth, Ice, Desoxyn". But "mice" isn't listed. However, "mice" is a slang term for meth. But since it's not in the index terms, I should mark it as "other". 

Wait, but the example 3 had "xans" which wasn't in the list, so it was "other". Similarly, "mice" here isn't in the index terms, so it's "other". 

So the detected phrases are "arak" and "mice". Both are not in the index terms, so both should be "other". 

But wait, maybe "arak" is a drug? Let me check again. Arak is a type of spirit, but in some contexts, it's a slang for a drug. However, according to the index terms provided, there's no mention of arak. So it's "other". 

So the JSON array would have two entries: "arak" and "mice" both as "other".
