Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a social media post and wants me to detect any drug-related references, link them to the appropriate index terms, and return a JSON array.

First, I'll read through the post carefully. The post is a series of hashtags and statements. Let me break it down:

The post starts with "#CrimesAgainstHumanity" followed by some lines. Then there's "USA ~ Healthcare✖️", "Cannabis to Eat✖️", "Wages✖️", etc. The key part here is the part where it mentions "Marijuana Prohibition of #Food ✔️" and "Workers vs Oligarchy ✔️". 

Now, I need to check if any of these phrases refer to illicit drugs or substances. The main terms here are "Marijuana" and "Cannabis". Looking at the index terms, "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)" is listed. So "Marijuana" and "Cannabis" would map to that index term. 

But wait, the post says "Marijuana Prohibition of #Food". The word "prohibition" here is about legal status, not the substance itself. However, the term "Marijuana" is explicitly mentioned. Since the index term includes "Marijuana" as a synonym, that's a direct match. 

Are there any other terms? The hashtag #Food might be a reference, but "Food" isn't listed in the index terms related to drugs. The other parts like "Healthcare", "Wages", "Climate Action" are not drug-related. The "Workers vs Oligarchy" is a political statement, not a drug reference. 

So the only drug-related term here is "Marijuana" and "Cannabis". Both are under the index term "Marijuana (Cannabis, Weed, Pot)". 

Wait, the post has "Cannabis to Eat✖️". The word "Cannabis" is part of that phrase. So "Cannabis" is a direct match. 

So the matched phrases would be "Marijuana" and "Cannabis", both linked to the index term "Marijuana". 

I need to check if there are any other possible terms. The hashtag #Food is mentioned, but "Food" isn't a drug. The other terms like "Prohibition" are about laws, not the substance. 

Therefore, the correct JSON array should have two entries: one for "Marijuana" and one for "Cannabis", both under the index term "Marijuana".
