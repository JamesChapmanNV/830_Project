This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nMorphine can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.\n\nDependence and abuse potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the serious risks of overdose with morphine, including respiratory depression and death, and highlights the importance of harm reduction practices such as preventing aspiration by lying in the recovery position.

It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[34]\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nMorphine is dangerous to use in combination with other depressants as many fatalities reported as overdoses are caused by interactions with other depressant drugs like alcohol or benzodiazepines, resulting in dangerously high levels of respiratory depression.[35]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the dangers of opioid overdose, emphasizing how reduced tolerance after cessation increases overdose risk and how environmental factors influence this risk. It also highlights the heightened danger of combining morphine with other depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines, which can lead to fatal respiratory depression. These points are crucial for understanding morphine's toxicity, overdose prevention, and harm reduction strategies detailed in the full document.\n                "}
