This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position). In the case of an overdose, it is advised to administer a dose of naloxone intravenously or intramuscularly to counteract the effects of the substance.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.\n\nTolerance and addiction potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the toxic and dangerous effects of fentanyl, highlighting risks such as nausea, vomiting, and the potential for fatal aspiration during overdose.

Dosages of 10-25 mg per day are common for prescription pharmaceutical methamphetamine taken orally, usually spread out into two doses. A common (although unhealthy) use pattern for methamphetamine is to redose repeatedly for several days in a row. Depending on whether the intention is to stay awake, remain euphoric, or attempt to continue getting 'rushing' effects, doses are repeated every 3-8 hours (to stay awake) or every .5 to 4 hours (to remain \"high\"). Redosing often involves taking the same dose as the initial dose. As redosing continues beyond 48 hours, the dosages tend to go up. Tolerance to meth's effects -- where larger doses are required to achieve similar effects -- increases with frequency of use and with experience. A new user's 15 mg insufflated experience may be very euphoric and stimulating, while a 20 mg bump snorted by a regular user may be barely detectable.

Although the clinical scenarios may vary among patients, one of the main concerns is the level of expression of OIRD. In such cases, oxygen administration and respiratory assistance are a priority. An opioid drug antagonist such as naloxone can help to correct OIRD symptoms. Commonly, repeated doses are necessary since, over time, respiratory depression may overcome the effects of the antagonist drug, particularly with opiates such as fentanyl, in which increased receptor affinity may be present as compared to other opiates. Thus, the therapeutic approach should continue until a normal respiratory rate coincides with appropriate oxygen saturation levels.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a detailed description of typical clinical manifestations and emergency management strategies for fentanyl overdose, highlighting symptoms like respiratory depression and the use of naloxone.
