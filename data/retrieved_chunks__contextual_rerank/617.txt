These affect serotonin, the neurotransmitter in the brain that deals with both depression and drug craving. Sedatives such as Dalmane, chloral hydrate, Librium, phenobarbital, or even Valium are used, very carefully, on a short-term basis to treat anxiety or sleep disturbance problems. Antipsychotic medications such as Haldol, Thorazine, and others are also used to buffer the effects of unbalanced dopamine, the neurotransmitter that moderates paranoia and pleasurable sensation. In addition to treating the physical and psychological aspects of craving, treatment providers should stress group counseling and peer pressure for compulsive amphetamine users, as these forms of therapy work well for this population.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details common withdrawal symptoms from methamphetamine use, including sleep disturbances, increased hunger, and psychotic reactions, and describes medical treatment options such as antidepressants, sedatives, and antipsychotics.

Chronic use can lead to what is called 'Amphetamine Psychosis', resulting in paranoia, auditory and visual hallucinations, self-absorption, irritability, aggressive and erratic behavior, and picking at the skin. This can be magnified by lack of sleep which often accompanies heavy use of meth. Methamphetamine is an anorexant, meaning it causes most people to lose interest in food. This is considered a benefit for many light users, but in regular or heavy users can lead to malnutrition. Methamphetamine is also believed to be neurotoxic.\n\nContraindications #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides key information about the effects, problems, and contraindications associated with methamphetamine use, including duration, visual effects, health risks, and safety warnings.

The literature gives conflicting reports, due to the fact that many criteria are subjective, and probably also due to confusion over terminology. The pharmacological effects of methamphetamine are very similar to those of similarly structured molecules.\n\nAdministration\n\nMethamphetamine can be taken orally, snorted, smoked or injected, in approximately increasing order of immediacy of onset.\n\nOnset\n\nOnset can be immediate (in the case of injection), or can take as long as 30-40 minutes if ingested orally.\n\nDuration\n\nDuration is subjective, but is probably on the order of 4 - 8 hours. Delayed absorption (for example, due to oral ingestion) can prolong the effects relative to time of administration. Of course, larger doses last longer due to the fact that it is removed from the blood at a finite rate.\n\nPlasma Life\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides an overview of methamphetamine's pharmacology, including its subjective effects, routes of administration, onset, duration, and plasma lifespan. It complements the overall document by detailing the drug's psychoactive properties and pharmacokinetics, essential for understanding its impact and usage patterns.\n                "}
