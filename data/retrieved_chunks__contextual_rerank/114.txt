However, this effect is generally less consistent than the effect of psychedelics or entactogens . Sometimes the opposite effect occurs, causing music to sound alien and unpleasant.\n- Introspection - Some user reports suggest ketamine may enhance introspection; however, this effect appears to be much less consistent and robust than psychedelics and entactogens . It should be noted that there is limited evidence showing ketamine has psychotherapeutic benefits.\n- Memory suppression - Strongly suppresses short and long-term memory (in a dose-dependent manner) for the duration of the experience.
