Can it make it harder for me to get pregnant?\n\nMethamphetamine has not been studied to see if using it could make it harder to get pregnant.\n\n◈ I just found out that I am pregnant, should I stop taking methamphetamine?\n\nIf you are using methamphetamine without medical supervision (sometimes called recreational use), treatment is available to help you stop. Talk to your healthcare provider as soon as possible so that you can start treatment. If you do not have a healthcare provider, call the national number for drug treatment referral at 800-662-4357. When you call, let them know that you are pregnant so that you can get connected to the best facility to meet your needs.\n\n◈ Does taking methamphetamine increase the chance of miscarriage?\n\nMiscarriage is common and can occur in any pregnancy for many different reasons. Based on the studies reviewed, methamphetamine use might increase the chance for miscarriage.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk addresses reproductive health concerns related to methamphetamine, including its potential impact on pregnancy and fertility, and provides guidance for pregnant users.
