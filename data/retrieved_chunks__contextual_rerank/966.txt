It was found in combination with free morphine and 6-acetylmorphine, codeine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine in postmortem cases at the Puerto Rico Institute of Forensic Sciences (PRIFS). Xylazine is not approved for human use because it has been proven harmful. Currently, three separate analyses are required to determine all the aforementioned drugs at the PRIFS's toxicology laboratory. To reduce analysis time consumption, sample volume, run time, sample preparation and cost, a high-throughput ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of xylazine, free morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, codeine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine in 0.25 mL postmortem blood by protein precipitation, fulfilling confirmation criteria with three transitions for each compound with acceptable relative ion intensities.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the detection of xylazine as an adulterant in heroin in Puerto Rico, highlighting its co-occurrence with other opioids and cocaine in postmortem toxicology cases. It emphasizes the development of a high-throughput UHPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of xylazine, morphine, acetylmorphine, codeine, and related compounds in blood samples. This information enhances the document's coverage of emerging drugs and analytical techniques relevant to opioid adulteration and forensic drug testing.\n                "}
