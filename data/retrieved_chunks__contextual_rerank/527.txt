Overdose deaths are largely assumed to be the result of excessive opioid consumption. In many of these cases, however, opioid abusers are often polydrug abusers. Benzodiazepines are one of the most commonly co-abused substances and pose a significant risk to opioid users. In 2016, the FDA required boxed warnings - the FDA's strongest warning - for prescription opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines about the serious risks associated with using these medications at the same time. The point of our studies was to evaluate the interactions between these two classes of drugs. We investigated whether diazepam adds to the depressant effects of opioids or do they alter the levels of tolerance to opioids. In the present study, we have found that the antinociceptive tolerance that developed to repeated administration of oxycodone was reversed by an acute dose of diazepam. Antinociceptive tolerance to hydrocodone was\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the risks of polydrug abuse involving oxycodone and benzodiazepines, highlighting FDA warnings and research findings on drug interactions. It is relevant to the broader document as it emphasizes safety concerns, drug tolerance, and interaction effects related to oxycodone's pharmacological profile.\n                "}
