They are usually very mild when they do happen to occur.\n\nCognitive effects\n\nThe cognitive effects of methamphetamine can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of methamphetamine is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation, increased focus, ego inflation and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical stimulant cognitive effects. Although negative side effects are usually mild at low to moderate dosages, they become increasingly likely to manifest themselves with higher amounts or widespread usage. This particularly holds true during the offset of the experience. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:\n\nAnalysis enhancement\n\nCompulsive redosing\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details specific visual and cognitive effects associated with methamphetamine use, including brightness alteration, hallucinations, and rare transformations, as well as emphasizing the dose-dependent nature of cognitive impacts like analysis enhancement and redosing behavior.
