This is called the background risk. Based on the studies reviewed, exposure to fentanyl is not expected to increase the chance of birth defects above the background risk.Some studies that have looked at opioids as a group suggest that opioids in general might be associated with birth defects. However, studies have not found a specific pattern of birth defects caused by opioids. Based on these studies, if there is an increased chance for birth defects with opioid use in pregnancy, it is likely to be small.\n\n◈ Does taking fentanyl in pregnancy increase the chance of other pregnancy-related problems?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses fetal and pregnancy outcomes related to fentanyl exposure, providing data on birth defect risks and other pregnancy complications. It is relevant for users seeking specific safety and health information about fentanyl use during pregnancy. The content highlights that fentanyl does not significantly increase the risk of birth defects or other pregnancy-related problems according to current studies.\n                "}
