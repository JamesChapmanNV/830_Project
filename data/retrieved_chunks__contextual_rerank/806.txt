Products containing low quantities of codeine (such as Tylenol 1) can be purchased over-the-counter, but products with higher quantities require a prescription. As of July 2018, we're told that there seem to be more controls on non-prescription codeine sales by pharmacies, with many often reporting they are out of stock, some pharmacies refusing sales, and others requiring registering with the pharmacy to purchase codeine in Canada. (Last updated July 11 2018)\n\nCayman Islands #\n\nWe don't have any information about the exact legal status of codeine in the Cayman Islands, but we've been told that at least some pharmacies have it available without a prescription.

When used recreationally they are commonly known as lean or purple drank.\n\nToxicity and harm potential\n\nCodeine has a low toxicity relative to dose. As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy and memory loss. Some people may also have an allergic reaction to codeine, such as the swelling of skin and rashes.[10] It is also potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.\n\nTolerance and addiction potential\n\nAs with other opioids, the chronic use of codeine can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the toxicity, harm potential, and addiction risks associated with codeine, highlighting its low toxicity relative to dosage, potential allergic reactions, and dangers when combined with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines. It emphasizes harm reduction practices and explains the drug's moderate addictive potential and likelihood of psychological dependence with chronic use. This information is crucial for understanding the safety concerns and dependency risks outlined in the broader opioid profile.\n                "}
