This effect occurs via stimulation of mu-opioid receptors on the myenteric plexus, which in turn inhibits gastric emptying and reduces peristalsis. Other common side effects include central nervous system depression, nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention. Respiratory depression is among the more serious adverse reactions with opiate use that is especially important to monitor in the postoperative patient population. Other reported side effects include lightheadedness, sedation, and dizziness. Patients often report nausea and vomiting, which is why in many emergency departments, morphine administration is with an antiemetic such as ondansetron. Other effects include euphoria, dysphoria, agitation, dry mouth, anorexia, and biliary tract spasm, which is why some physicians will avoid morphine when patients present with right upper quadrant pain and they suspect possible biliary tract pathology.
