As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy, and memory loss. It is also potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.\n\nTolerance and addiction potential\n\nAs with other opioids, the chronic use of oxycodone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides user anecdotal experiences and highlights the toxicity, harm potential, and addiction risks of oxycodone, emphasizing its relatively low toxicity but significant dependence potential and the importance of harm reduction practices within the broader drug information overview.\n                "}

Some people choose to grind and insufflate (snort) oxycodone tablets in order to get a stronger effect, however, the use of higher dose sustained-release tablets in this manner can be very dangerous. An average adult dose is typically 5 mg every six hours. Tolerance develops very quickly; those who take it on a daily basis may find they need to increase their dosage in order to get the same effects. Higher doses, especially the 80 mg sustained-release tablets are for opioid-tolerant people only.\n\nPrice #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed dosage information, pricing, and safety cautions for oxycodone, a key section within the larger Erowid page on oxycodone.
