Moreover, psychological and psychomotor functions are not adversely affected. Chronic use and high doses of up to 1500 mg per day have been repeatedly shown to be well tolerated by humans. As a result, it is considered to have a good safety profile.[28] However, this information should be interpreted cautiously as cannabidiol has been subject to relatively few human studies; further research is needed to fully establish its safety profile.\n\nCommonly reported side effects from prescribed cannabidiol use include tiredness, diarrhea, and changes of appetite and weight.[29]\n\nDependence and abuse potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the toxicity, safety profile, and potential side effects of cannabidiol, highlighting its general tolerance, low toxicity, and minimal adverse effects based on clinical studies.

On the basis of chemical degradation and correlation with cannabinol, a general structure was proposed. In 1963, Raphael Mechoulam isolated CBD from Lebanese hashish and established its structure and relative stereochemistry.[7] Its absolute stereochemistry was determined in 1967.[7]\n\nAdulterated CBD-products\n\nAt least 128 samples out of more than 350 tested by government labs in nine states, nearly all in the South, had 371 types of synthetic cannabinoids in products marketed as CBD. Half of the 28 tested CBD-vape products contained less than 0.3% CBD.[8]\n\nChemistry\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides historical, cultural, and chemical background on cannabidiol (CBD), highlighting its first isolation in 1940, structural elucidation by Raphael Mechoulam in the 1960s, and issues with adulterated CBD products containing synthetic cannabinoids, relevant to understanding CBD's origins, chemistry, and quality concerns discussed in the broader document.\n                "}
