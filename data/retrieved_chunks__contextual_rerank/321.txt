In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. Oxymorphone injection may cause miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information on the human toxicity symptoms associated with acute oxymorphone overdose, including respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils, and potential progression to coma or death.

Opioid overdose is characteristically associated with a triad of abnormally slow respiration (apnea), decreased consciousness (coma), and pinpoint pupils (miosis). Codeine has a narrow therapeutic index, with a dose of 500 to 1000 mg usually proving fatal, though codeine-dependent individuals have been reported to use as much as 1536 mg daily.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides critical information on the toxicity and overdose risks of codeine, highlighting the increasing prevalence of opioid-related deaths and the narrow margin between therapeutic and fatal doses.
