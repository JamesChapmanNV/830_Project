Methadone may be prescribed for pain in the U.S. as well as a treatment for drug addiction. Methadone used for detoxification can only be prescribed and administered by licensed clinics where patients are usually given methadone in liquid to be taken while watched by the dispensing nurse. Starting January 2008, at the DEA's request, manufacturers of 40 mg methadone tablets will only sell to faclities registered to do drug detoxification and maintenance. See DEA Advisory. On May 22, 2008, the DEA issued a Final Rule in the Federal Register increasing the number of patients a clinic can prescribe controlled substances (such as methadone or buprenorphine) to for the purposes of \"maintenance or detoxification\". Prior to this new rule, the maximum number of patients was 30 and has been raised to 100.
