Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The pure opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes against respiratory depression which results from opioid overdose. Naloxone should be administered intravenously; however, because its duration of action is relatively short, the patient must be carefully monitored until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to naloxone is suboptimal or not sustained, additional naloxone may be administered, as needed, or given by continuous infusion to maintain alertness and respiratory function; however, there is no information available\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides critical emergency treatment guidance for morphine overdose, emphasizing airway management, supportive measures, and the use of opioid antagonists like naloxone.
