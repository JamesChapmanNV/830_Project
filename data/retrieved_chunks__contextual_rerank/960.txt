One patient may experience a positive effect filled with bright hallucinations, sights, and sensations, increased awareness owing to mind expansion, and marked euphoria. The positive spectrum of effects is colloquially called a \"good trip.\" Another patient may experience the total opposite with an experience filled with increased anxiety becoming panic, fear, depression, despair, and disappointment. The negative spectrum is colloquially called a \"bad trip.\" One patient can experience both the positive and negative spectrum at different times of use.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section summarizes the highly subjective and variable adverse effects of LSD, highlighting the unpredictable range of psychological experiences, from euphoria and visual hallucinations to anxiety and panic, and notes that individuals can have both positive and negative reactions during use.
