Morphine sulfate was nominated for investigation ... based on several diverse studies that indicated that it is immunosuppressive. ... A time course study was performed using slow release 75 mg morphine pellets. The IgM AFC response to sRBC and MLR were used as the indicators of immunosuppression. A request was made to the National Institute of Drug Abuse for 3 pellet dose levels of morphine. As a part of the range-finding investigation, a dose-response study was performed which measured morphine levels and corticosterone levels as well as the IgM spleen antibody-forming cell response. The pellet sizes used were 8, 25 and 75 mg pellets. The peak time for immunosuppression occurred when the antigen was administered 24 hours after implant. In these same studies, complete tolerance to the morphine action occurred by day 5 after implantation. Morphine levels reaching 1610 ng/mL were obtained within 24 hours of pellet implant. The studies showed that 24 hours after implant with 8 mg\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details research on morphine sulfate's immunosuppressive effects, including studies measuring immune response suppression in animal models using different pellet doses and timing.

The most pronounced effect of methadone was a dose-dependent decrease in the phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells of the liver. There was also a significant decrease in the ability of resident macrophages of the spleen to phagocytize sRBC. Although the animals had a compromised ability to phagocytize, host resistance to two bacterial models was unaltered.
