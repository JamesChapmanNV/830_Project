It is still, however, capable of extreme intensity and overwhelming bliss at heavier dosages with a low tolerance. The sensation itself can be described as powerful and overwhelming feeling of emotional bliss, contentment, and happiness.

However, it is not capable of higher end visual disconnection such as holes, spaces and voids or hallucinatory structures in the same way that traditional dissociatives are.
