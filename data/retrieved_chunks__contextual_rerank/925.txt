When the heroin base enters the body, it is fairly lipophilic, so a portion of the dose readily crosses the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system where the hydrolysis of the two esters can take place. Morphine is less lipophilic than heroin and does not cross back across the blood-brain barrier as readily. Morphine readily undergoes the additional phase I metabolic transformation of oxidative N-demethylation by CYP2D6. Phase II (conjugation) reactions of morphine include formation of the glucuronide conjugates at the hydroxyl moieties at positions 3 and 6. The glucuronides are then excreted. Note that the aromatic ring stays intact throughout the metabolic transformations, illustrating the stability imparted by aromaticity.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the metabolic pathway of heroin conversion to morphine, highlighting key processes such as ester hydrolysis, blood-brain barrier crossing, phase I oxidative N-demethylation by CYP2D6, and phase II conjugation forming glucuronide metabolites. It emphasizes the chemical stability of the aromatic ring throughout metabolism. This information is crucial for understanding morphine biotransformation, its pharmacokinetics, and its presence in drug testing within the comprehensive chemical and pharmacological profile provided in the document.\n                "}
