ANIMAL STUDIES: The clinical signs associated with morphine intoxication in animals differ from those in man. While humans usually die in coma, animals die during or after a series of convulsion. Intoxicated dogs show signs of vomition, delirium, clonic spasms and stertorous breathing. In the cat, a hypnotic effect is rarely seen, the action being that of motor excitement. Reversible lens opacities developed in mice, rats, and guinea pigs in less than an hour after administration of morphine, which has been explained by a reduction in blinking, a resultant exposure of the cornea, increased evaporation, and dehydration of the anterior segment of the eye, causing temporary loss of transparency. A study with rats pointed out the risk of hepatic damage due to long term usage of morphine\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes animal studies on morphine toxicity and behavioral effects, highlighting differences between human and animal responses, such as death via coma in humans versus convulsions in animals.
