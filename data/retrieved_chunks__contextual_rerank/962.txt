They usually decrease quickly in number and intensity with time, and rarely occur more than a few months after the original trip. A typical minor and pleasant flashback is the following: ... Frequently afterward there is a momentary \"opening\" (\"flash\" would be too spastic a word) when for maybe a couple of seconds an area one is looking at casually, and indeed unthinkingly, suddenly takes on the intense vividness, composition, and significance of things seen while in the psychedelic condition. This \"scene\" is nearly always a small field of vision -- sometimes a patch of grass, a spray of twigs, even a piece of newspaper in the street or the remains of a meal on a plate. (Cohen 1970[1965], pp. 114-115) Here are two more troublesome examples: For about a week I couldn't walk through the lobby of A-entry at the dorm without getting really scared, because of the goblin I saw there when I was tripping.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses LSD flashbacks, describing their typical brief duration, visual phenomena like sudden vivid scenes, and potential psychological distress, including specific examples of anxiety and fear experienced during such episodes.

Dosages of 10-25 mg per day are common for prescription pharmaceutical methamphetamine taken orally, usually spread out into two doses. A common (although unhealthy) use pattern for methamphetamine is to redose repeatedly for several days in a row. Depending on whether the intention is to stay awake, remain euphoric, or attempt to continue getting 'rushing' effects, doses are repeated every 3-8 hours (to stay awake) or every .5 to 4 hours (to remain \"high\"). Redosing often involves taking the same dose as the initial dose. As redosing continues beyond 48 hours, the dosages tend to go up. Tolerance to meth's effects -- where larger doses are required to achieve similar effects -- increases with frequency of use and with experience. A new user's 15 mg insufflated experience may be very euphoric and stimulating, while a 20 mg bump snorted by a regular user may be barely detectable.
