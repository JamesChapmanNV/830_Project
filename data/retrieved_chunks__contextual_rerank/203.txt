This occurs due to the way in which opioids functionally mimic the body's natural endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (pain reduction), sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure and enjoyment. They are believed to be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's euphoric, analgesic (pain relief), and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects.\n\nMorphine is produced by the human body in small amounts and acts as an immunomodulator. Endogenous morphine binds preferentially to the μ3 opioid receptor.[28]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details morphine's pharmacological mechanism of action, explaining how it binds to and activates the μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors to produce analgesic, euphoric, and anxiolytic effects. It also notes that endogenous morphine exists in small amounts in the body and interacts with the μ3 receptor, highlighting both the drug's and body's natural opioid functions. This information is crucial for understanding morphine's effects and receptor targets detailed elsewhere in the document.\n                "}

Morphine has potentially serious side effects such as respiratory depression and low blood pressure, which can be fatal when it is mixed with other depressants. Other side effects of morphine include drowsiness, vomiting, and constipation.\n\n\n\nThe primary source of morphine is isolation from poppy straw of the opium poppy.\n\nMorphine can be administered orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally. It reaches its maximum effect in around 20 min when given intravenously and 60 min when given orally while the duration of effect is between three and seven hours.[8][9] Long-acting formulations also exist such as, Kadian which is capable of producing clinically significant effects for upwards of 24 hours.[10][11]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of morphine's historical discovery, subjective effects, and methods of administration, highlighting its potent pain-relief properties, side effects like respiratory depression, and common routes of use with onset times and duration.
