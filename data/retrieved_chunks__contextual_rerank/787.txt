[8] This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria , pain relief , muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\nCodeine itself is a weak ligand for the opioid receptors. However, its main active metabolite, morphine , shows much stronger agonistic effects .\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains the pharmacological mechanism of codeine and its active metabolite morphine, detailing how they interact with μ-opioid receptors to produce effects like euphoria and pain relief. It highlights that while codeine is a weak ligand, its conversion to morphine accounts for its stronger opioid activity, a key aspect of its psychoactive profile discussed elsewhere in the document.\n                "}
