Because of this, the effects will probably become noticeable within 15min. Note : I don't suggest you evaporate the mixture unless you are willing to wait a while. The Merck index warns that codeine is sensitive to heat and light. For that reason if you wish to evaporate the mixture, do it without heat, and shield the solution from light. In order to take full advantage of codeine, it is helpful to be familiar with some relevant pharmacology: *CYP2D6 The body converts codeine into morphine (~10%) by using the so called P450 cytochrome pathway, especially cytochrome 2d6 (cyp2d6). Unfortunately, cyp2d6 is missing in about 7% of the white population, and its manifestation is quite variable in the rest. Individuals who inherited a cyp2d6 deficiency will get many of the adverse effects associated with codeine but little euphoria. If codeine just doesn't work for you, this may be why. Some drugs also interfere with cyp2d6. Prime among these are the\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the recommended handling of codeine solutions, including cautions against evaporation and advice on protecting the compound from heat and light, referencing the sensitivity of codeine as noted by the Merck index. It also explains the pharmacogenetic role of CYP2D6 in converting codeine to morphine, highlighting how genetic variations affect individual responses to codeine and interactions with other drugs that inhibit this enzyme.\n                "}

The Procedure 1. Obtain a quantity of tablets containing codeine, check to see if they contain anything other than codeine, caffeine, acetaminophen or aspirin. If they do, and you don't know whether or not it will be a problem, your best bet is not to use them. Measure out your desired amount of codeine (ex. 64 mg = 8 tablets * 8 mg/tablet). You may want to add 2 extra tablets as it is quite likely you will lose some codeine in the procedure. As you get more experience with the procedure you will be able to get approx. 95% of the codeine extracted. 2. Measure out some nice hot water, use approx. 40 ml / 20 tablets or more if needed. I would suggest you don't go over 50 ml for 20 tablets. I don't know if the use of boiling water would destroy any of the codeine but your best bet is not to use it. Use hot water but not boiling. Make sure the tablets dissolve completely.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a step-by-step procedure for extracting codeine from OTC tablets, emphasizing measuring a desired dose, using hot water (not boiling), and filtering the solution.
