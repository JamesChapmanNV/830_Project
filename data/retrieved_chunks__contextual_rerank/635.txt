To reduce damage, it is recommended to grind the substance completely before use and alternate nostrils. [49] Additionally, a default saline nasal spray application helps wash out acidic/caustic substances from the affected area. Also, sharing snorting equipment (nasal spray bottles, straws, banknotes, bullets, etc) has been linked to the transmission of hepatitis C. (Bonkovsky and Mehta) In one study, the University of Tennessee Medical Center researches warned that other blood-borne diseases such as HIV, the AIDS-causing virus, could be transmitted as well. [50] Drinking makes it harder to resist pressure and clouds your ability to make safe choices. Not only might you miss signs of danger, like blood stains on shared equipment, but alcohol weakens your immune system, making it easier to catch and spread viruses.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides harm reduction advice related to nasal administration of ketamine, emphasizing safe practices to prevent nasal damage, infection transmission, and associated blood-borne diseases like hepatitis C and HIV.

This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.\n\nGHB/GBL - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.\n\nOpioids - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates.
