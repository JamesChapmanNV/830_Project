Codeine from the ancient Greek, κώδεια, means cup shaped like a poppyhead.[17] Morphine use was spearheaded by Dr. Alexander Wood's invention the hypodermic syringe in 1853.[16][14] However, it wasn't until the American Civil War in 1861, the Prussian-Austrian War in 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 that morphine saw widespread use as part of military medicine. It wasn't until after these military conflicts that morphine habituation gained a reputation as the \"soldier's disease\" or the \"army disease\". With the addictive and habit forming properties of morphine now known the medical establishment was on the lookout for a less addictive alternative to morphine. This came in the form of diacetylmorphine or as it was later marketed, Heroin. Although it was later learned that heroin was not less addictive than codeine and in fact the contrary. The first chemical structure of morphine was proposed by Robinson and\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers the historical development and cultural significance of morphine, including its isolation, medical use in war, and the emergence of heroin as a less addictive alternative.
