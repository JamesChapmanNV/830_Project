If the hydroxyl were on the second carbon from the ring (the carbon with the amine group, the NH2 or NHCH3), there might be some chance, but it's not and there's not. You're not getting a basic group off an acidic carbon without a fight, and acids, borohydride, and LiAlhydride aren't gonna fight that hard. From: yshan@bcarh697.bnr.ca (Yogi Shan) I'm sorry to say that no method attempting to directly reduce (pseudo)ephedrine's hydroxyl group is going to work. Your post was interesting, but this is not quite true. Direct hydrogenation over Pd or Pd on a carrier is well known and facile. You add a little perchloric, phosphoric or sulphuric acid, which esterifies the-OH group that you're complaining about. Thus making the intermediate halide via SOCl2, like you mentioned, is unnecessary.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses methods for chemically reducing (pseudo)ephedrine to methamphetamine, specifically discussing the challenges associated with directly reducing the hydroxyl group. It clarifies that alcohol reduction is generally ineffective due to the hydroxyl's placement on an acidic carbon, but notes that direct hydrogenation over palladium with acid esterification can facilitate the process, offering a relevant detail for clandestine synthesis techniques within the broader chemical synthesis discussion.\n                "}

Or a dealer uses Ephedrine as cut. The problem with Ephedrine (far more so than pseudephedrine) is its beta-agonist properties - it raises blood pressure and pulse far more per \"unit of high\" than methamphetamine. It is advisable to become familiar with the many ways of synthesizing methcathinone from (pseudo)ephedrine, as just such a procedure can be used on freshly produced methamphetamine to verify that the (pseudo)ephedrine was in fact reduced. The smell of basic methcathinone has been reported to resemble that of \"pistachio ice cream\". Suffice to say that it is sweet, pleasant, and to a cat-head, nirvana. You should become familiar with this as well, in order to be able to know if suspected methamphetamine is in fact actually methcathinone.
