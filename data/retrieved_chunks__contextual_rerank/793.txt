This has resulted in many people disregarding the psychedelic aspects of MDMA as a myth, rumor or negligible effect despite a large body of anecdotal reports suggesting otherwise. The (often mild) hallucinatory effects cannot be guaranteed to manifest themselves, but are the most likely to occur with chemically pure MDMA at high doses, as well as towards the end of the experience; particularly if the user has been smoking cannabis . The visuals during the offset are usually characterized by closed eye visuals (CEVs) such as typical psychedelic-like pattering. Whereas during the peak effects, the visuals tend to be more similar to the open eye distortions of standard psychedelics, albeit in much more mildly and less vivid form. They also seem more likely to occur if the user has prior experience with psychedelics .

It emphasizes that visual distortions during peak effects resemble those of psychedelics but are generally less vivid, and that prior psychedelic experience can influence visual phenomena. This information is crucial for understanding MDMA’s sensory enhancement profile within the broader discussion of its subjective effects.\n                "}

For instance, CBD is more effective than vitamin C and E as a neuroprotective antioxidant and can ameliorate skin conditions such as acne.[20][21] It should be noted that cannabidiol has been the subject of sensational health claims in the popular media.
