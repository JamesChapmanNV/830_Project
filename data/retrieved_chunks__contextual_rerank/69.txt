Masseter muscle spasm and laryngospasm may also occur. Acute overdosage produces signs of opioid toxicity: circulatory and CNS depression, lethargy, coma, respiratory depression, and decreased GI motility with ileus. Miosis is a variable finding, depending on the particular opioid, co-ingestants, and secondary effects, such as hypoxia. Apnea, hypotension, bradycardia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, seizures, dysrhythmias, and death may occur with severe poisoning. With continued use, tolerance to the pharmacologic and adverse effects of the drug develop, but the rate of development of tolerance exhibits considerable interindividual variation. ANIMAL STUDIES: Fentanyl was not teratogenic in rats at dosages of 10-500 ug/kg daily when administered on days 7-21 of gestation. At an IV dosage of 10-30 ug/kg daily on days 6-18 of gestation in rats, fentanyl was embryotoxic or fetotoxic and slightly increased mean\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details fentanyl's acute overdose signs, including respiratory depression, CNS depression, and variable miosis, as well as severe poisoning risks like apnea and death.

Although the clinical scenarios may vary among patients, one of the main concerns is the level of expression of OIRD. In such cases, oxygen administration and respiratory assistance are a priority. An opioid drug antagonist such as naloxone can help to correct OIRD symptoms. Commonly, repeated doses are necessary since, over time, respiratory depression may overcome the effects of the antagonist drug, particularly with opiates such as fentanyl, in which increased receptor affinity may be present as compared to other opiates. Thus, the therapeutic approach should continue until a normal respiratory rate coincides with appropriate oxygen saturation levels.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a detailed description of typical clinical manifestations and emergency management strategies for fentanyl overdose, highlighting symptoms like respiratory depression and the use of naloxone.

At high doses and overdoses, opioid-induced respiratory depression can result in a shortness of breath, abnormal breathing patterns, semi-consciousness, or unconsciousness.
