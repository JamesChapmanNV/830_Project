It is also a watched chemical. A private citizen ordering methylamine from a chemical supply company would get the undivided attention of the local DEA. Methylamine can be diverted in small quantities by individuals working in legitimate chemical labs. In some cases this \"diversion\" is simply theft. It is not recommended that any persons engage in this activity, but it remains a common source of methylamine (along with many other chemicals). Methylamine can be synthesized through hydrolyzing N-methylacetamide via refluxing it with concentrated HCl. Dump a gallon of concentrated HCl in a large RB flask, dump in a mole or two of N-methylacamide and reflux the hell out of it for about 2 days. This leaves water, methylamine and acetic acid. Boil off the water, and strip the acetic acid off with a vacuum pump and what's left is the methylamine. Some acetic acid may be\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains the role of methylamine in MDMA synthesis, highlighting its importance despite not being a traditional precursor and noting its status as a watched chemical.
