Imitating his father, a successful self-made man who had married a woman twenty years younger than himself, PQ dated only women under the age of nineteen. Being attractive to young women was so imporant to him that much of his time was spent in the company of teenagers. During business hours he would wear a conservative three-piece suit and drive a new sedan, but when he was with his young friends he would wear a leather jacket and drive a motorcycle. Anxiety and fears of inadequacy dominated both of these lives.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the type of opioid, age, gender, and race on the incidence of side effects from short-term opioid use. A secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study in 35 community-based and tertiary hospitals was done. There were 8855 black or white subjects aged 16 years and older. Patients received meperidine (INN, pethidine), morphine, or fentanyl as part of their treatment. Measurements were made to assess the presence of nausea and vomiting and respiratory depression. Of the patients, 26% had nausea and vomiting and 1.5% had respiratory depression after opioid administration. After adjustment for opioid dose, route of administration, age, gender, and race, meperidine produced less nausea and vomiting (odds ratio [OR] = 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-0.8) and less respiratory depression (OR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9) than morphine.
