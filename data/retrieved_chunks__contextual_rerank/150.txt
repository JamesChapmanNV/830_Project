[Details] Original Author Unknown Maintained and Updated by Erowid You may have heard about \"no-hitter\" that Bob Milacki's of the Oakland A's pitched last week. No-hitters are pretty rare and this one made the news everywhere. One of the local TV stations refered to it as Milacki's \"no-no,\" a term that originated with Dock Ellis's no-hitter back on June 12th, 1970 for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Dock pitched that game on acid. Reportedly he wrote about the experience in his authobiography (Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball) published in 1976. Here are some interesting excerpts from an account of the game in the August 1987 issue of High Times magazine and from a Lysergic World article from 1993. \"Dock woke up late. Why shouldn't he? As far as he knew, the team had an off day and he planned to take full advantage of it. Three hits of LSD were ready and waiting in the refrigerator.\" \"A few minutes later, his girlfriend returned\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt describes the anecdote of Dock Ellis pitching a no-hitter while under the influence of LSD, highlighting a famous example of psychedelic use in popular culture.

His concentration, however, was superb. As long as he kept to his fastball, the comets kept burning across the plate. All he had to do was steer the ball down the multicolored path. Dock had a crazed look in his eyes and his lack of control was evident to the batters, many of whom were feeling increasingly vulnerable in the batter's box. Dock easily retired three batters in a row [in the second inning]. (HT, 1987) I was zeroed in on the (catcher's) glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving out of the way of a ball I thought was a line drive.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details Dock Ellis's infamous 1970 no-hitter game while under the influence of LSD, describing his altered perception, control issues, and hallucinatory experiences on the mound.
