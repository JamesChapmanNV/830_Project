When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to the effects of methamphetamine rapidly develops with prolonged and repeated use.[35][36] This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methamphetamine presents cross-tolerance with all dopaminergic stimulants, meaning that after the consumption of methamphetamine all stimulants will have a reduced effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the dependence and abuse potential of methamphetamine, highlighting its high addiction risk, symptoms of psychological dependence, rapid tolerance development requiring increasing doses, and cross-tolerance with other dopaminergic stimulants, emphasizing the substance's significant health and safety concerns discussed throughout the drug profile.\n                "}
