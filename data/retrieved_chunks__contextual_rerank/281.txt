At this dosage range the adverse effects tend to be minimal, and the pleasurable effects quite noticeable. [I have never noticed any euphoria below 100 mg, so don't give up just because two 3s don't give you a high. *However, some unfortunate individuals are allergic to codeine, and, if you have never used it before, first try a dose of around 30-60 mg and see what will happen. It is dangerous to start off in the high dose range.*] It is usually a good idea to take the drug on an empty stomach, and if nausea is experienced or you get hungry (not likely) you can have something to eat. On an empty stomach the effects will become noticeable within 15 min depending on the dose. With higher doses the effects can begin in as little as 7 min. The effects peak at\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides dosage guidance and safety precautions for first-time or low-tolerance users of codeine, emphasizing starting doses of 30-60 mg and the risks of overdose.

The aim of the study was to describe codeine intoxication experiences amongst recreational drug users, as posted on public Internet forums. Internet searches were carried out by using the specific key word 'codeine' and in combination with 'experience', 'report', 'trip' and 'forum'. 96 Trip reports and 156 thread discussions relating to the sole use of codeine were analyzed using the empirical phenomenological psychological (EPP) method. Nine themes and 72 categories emerged. Narratives illustrated transitions between medical and non-medical use of codeine for dulling of emotional and/or physical pain, opiate withdrawal management and for intoxication. Codeine's appeal centered on access via family medicine cabinets, prescribers and pharmacies. Discussion and dissemination of indigenous harm reduction tactics included the learning to appreciate codeine's effect\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes a study analyzing online reports of non-medical, recreational codeine use, highlighting themes of abuse, harm reduction, and user experiences.

Among the changes, the FDA is requiring a new boxed warning about the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death. Today's actions are among a number of steps the agency recently outlined in a plan to reassess its approach to opioid medications. The plan is focused on policies aimed at reversing the epidemic, while still providing patients in pain access to effective relief.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a 2016 FDA safety communication about new labeling requirements and boxed warnings for immediate-release opioid pain medicines, highlighting risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death.
