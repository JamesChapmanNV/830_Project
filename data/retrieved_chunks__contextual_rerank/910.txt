After World War I, Merck's US unit was confiscated.  The company most people know today as Merck is no longer affiliated with Merck (KGaA) of Germany.  However at the time of the original MDMA patent, Merck was a single company. 1927 Merck chemist Max Oberlin conducts the first animal testing with MDMA while investigating 'adrenaline- or ephetonine-like' substances. 3 1953 The Army Chemical Center studied MDMA toxicity by giving MDMA to guinea pigs, rats, mice, monkeys, and dogs.  It is determined to be less toxic than MDA. 4 1965 Alexander Shulgin synthesizes MDMA but does not yet try it. 5 1967-1970 The first small underground batches of MDMA are synthesized. Some, but relatively few individuals have tried it at this point. 6 [Details] Erowid does not currently have clear documentation about when the first recreational use of MDMA occurred.
