None of the 22 patients demonstrated objective or subjective symptoms on provocation with morphine and/or codeine. Regarding BAT with morphine and codeine, expression of CD63 on basophils from 14 opiate tolerant individuals remained comparable to spontaneous expression by resting cells. The remaining 4 patients were classified as nonresponders. Positive sIgE results to poppy seed and morphine are not per se predictive for genuine opiate allergy and should not be used in isolation to diagnose morphine or codeine allergy. To avoid overdiagnosis, for the time being, we propose to supplement serological diagnosis with an oral provocation test.

Recently, it has been suggested that sIgE to poppy seed extract and morphine would be reliable in the diagnosis of opiate allergy. However, given the high prevalence of sIgE antibodies to these compounds in an allergic population, the predictive value of these tests leaves significant doubts. This study aims at verifying the predictive value of positive poppy seed and morphine sIgE assays results. A total of 22 individuals with a positive sIgE to poppy seed or morphine were selected. All had controlled drug challenges with increasing doses of morphine and/or codeine. Of these, 18 patients had an additional basophil activation test (BAT) with morphine and codeine. None of the 22 patients demonstrated objective or subjective symptoms on provocation\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details recent human exposure studies evaluating diagnostic challenges in opioid allergy, specifically assessing the reliability of skin testing, drug-specific IgE assays, and basophil activation tests for morphine and poppy seed allergy, highlighting that positive sIgE results do not always correlate with clinical symptoms. It is relevant to the document's comprehensive review of opioid pharmacology, allergenicity, and safety considerations. Key data include the selective testing of 22 individuals, with no objective allergic reactions observed during provocation.\n                "}
