She was discharged and found unresponsive the next morning. She was conveyed to a second hospital in full cardiopulmonary arrest and despite resuscitative efforts, was pronounced dead upon arrival. An autopsy was performed and postmortem specimens were submitted and screened for drugs using mainly chromatographic techniques. Quantitation was achieved by gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detection. Confirmation was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Oxycodone was the only drug detected in the following concentrations: heart blood, 1.36 mg/L; gastric contents, 7.33 mg in 33 mL (222.34 mg/L); liver, 0.2 mg/kg; and urine, 47.23 mg/L (47,230 ng/mL).\n\nPMID:15577525\n\nArmstrong EJ et al; Am J Forensic Med Pathol 25 (4): 338-41 (2004)\n\n7.15 Drug Tolerance\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt reports a forensic case involving fatal oxycodone poisoning in a child, with detected concentrations in blood, gastric content, liver, and urine, highlighting oxycodone's toxicity and potential for overdose.
