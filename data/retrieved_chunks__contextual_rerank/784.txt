Combined with the extra energy the drug gives, it becomes easy to sustain bruises, blisters, or other bodily damage from extensive dancing, hiking, climbing, etc., without noticing it until after the damage is done. Under MDMA, it may seem \"right\" to make immediate changes in relationships (increasing or decreasing commitment) of all kinds. The fresh points of view appreciated during an MDMA session are one of the drug's most prized benefits, but it is probably unwise to actually make lasting relationship changes until you have a chance to see how you feel about them after the drug and its afterglow wear off.\n\nNeurotoxicity?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses safety concerns related to MDMA, focusing on reduced pain awareness that can lead to unintentional bodily harm from activities like dancing or climbing, and warns against making significant relationship decisions during or immediately after MDMA use, emphasizing the importance of post-session reflection.\n                "}
