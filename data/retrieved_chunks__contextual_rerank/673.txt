Although the clinical scenarios may vary among patients, one of the main concerns is the level of expression of OIRD. In such cases, oxygen administration and respiratory assistance are a priority. An opioid drug antagonist such as naloxone can help to correct OIRD symptoms. Commonly, repeated doses are necessary since, over time, respiratory depression may overcome the effects of the antagonist drug, particularly with opiates such as fentanyl, in which increased receptor affinity may be present as compared to other opiates. Thus, the therapeutic approach should continue until a normal respiratory rate coincides with appropriate oxygen saturation levels.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a detailed description of typical clinical manifestations and emergency management strategies for fentanyl overdose, highlighting symptoms like respiratory depression and the use of naloxone.

U-47700 (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-[2-(dimethyl-amino)cyclohexyl]-N-methylbenz-amide) is a nonfentanyl-based synthetic opioid with 7.5 times the binding affinity of morphine to mu-opioid. We report a case of fentanyl and U-47700 intoxication from what was thought to be illicitly purchased Norco. A 41-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) for altered mental status shortly after ingesting 3 beige Norco pills bearing a Watson imprint. She had pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression, which reversed after 0.4 mg naloxone administration intravenously. She had complete recovery and was discharged from the ED after a 4-hour observation period.
