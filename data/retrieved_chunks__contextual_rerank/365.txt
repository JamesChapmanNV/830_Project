Mostly the dangers are more subtle - a type of psychic dependence on ketamine, paranoia, and egocentricism. Many people who use ketamine heavily experience a new perspective on the world which seems to be quite egocentric and conspiratorial. Ketamine can increase one's sense of connection between events, synchronicities, etc. This, when interpreted in certain common ways, can lead people to believe that external events revolve around themselves (\"if that happened that way, and this happened this way, both of these things must be about me\"), and then, further, that people and events are working in some heretofore unseen concert, which may be either sinister or just novel. Pay special attention to these kinds of thought patterns and ask the question: \"what is most likely true\" instead of \"what may be true.\"\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses long-term psychological and perceptual effects of heavy and prolonged ketamine use, including potential lasting damage, subtle dependency, and altered cognitive patterns such as paranoia and egocentric thinking, highlighting health risks and mental health concerns addressed within the broader ketamine and drug safety sections of the webpage.\n                "}
