This means it is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. Methadone prescriptions can only be obtained by from a licensed doctor in a \"Methadone Clinic\". The \"Clinic\" and very few other Pharmacies can dispense Methadone. You must drink your \"Juice\" in front of a pharmacist and talk to him/her after you drink to make sure you've swallowed it. It is very hard to get Methadone from \"dealers\" on the street as most people on Methadone need it to help with the withdrawal and are very reluctant to give it up. (unconfirmed) (thanks SP)\n\nFrance #\n\nMethadone is an Annexe I medication in France. This means it is illegal to sell without a license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. Prescription methadone is strictly controlled.

Given its solubility, you will also end up with far less aspirin than acetominophen per volume of the product.] The idea behind the following extraction is that acetaminophen and aspirin (I'll use A/A from now on) are very _insoluble_ in cold water. Codeine phosphate (the most common salt of codeine) is very _soluble_ in water including cold water.
