It can be comprehensively described through its variations as delirious in believability, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. They usually follow themes of memory replays and semi-realistic or expected events. For example, people could be casually holding objects or performing actions which one would expect them to be in real life before disappearing and dissolving under further inspection. Common examples of this include seeing people wearing glasses, or hats when they are not and mistaking objects for human beings or animals.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details MDMA's visual and hallucinatory effects, specifically discussing external hallucinations involving autonomous entities, environments, and visual scenarios.

From: dmurphy3@aol.com (DMurphy3) This may be so (in fact I read the same article), but typically a water quench leads to the alcohol, which is what we were trying to get rid of to start with. Also, if one were using Na rather than Li (Na is the Birch, I too forget the Li named reduction), adding water to quench will *definitely* be exciting, particularly considering the flammability of THF or ether. Apparently they were following the guys handwritten notes. It would have been even more interesting had they used the real Birch method, using Na, especially when they tried the water quench ;>) From: eleusis@netcom.com (Eleusis) Yep - apparently that would be the case. As well, any extra Li (or Na if doing the straight Birch method) would convert to the Hydroxide, which might fuck the product up a bit. I bet you they *did* do that the first time, and then, after they replaced that wing of the lab, they decided not to \"publish\" those results ;-).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the technical considerations and potential issues encountered during a Birch reduction synthesis of methamphetamine, specifically highlighting the effects of water quenching with sodium or lithium metal.

In the US some paternalistic pharmacists will not sell if they don't like your looks.] The amount of codeine allowable by law in OTC products is 8 mg per unit dose of a drug. A example is 325 mg of acetaminophen/paracetamol (a unit dose of acetaminophen) and 8 mg codeine per tablet. This law is used to prevent the excessive use of codeine as one would have to take doses reaching toxicity of acetaminophen before any real problems with the codeine administration would occur. It's the same situation with aspirin. With OTC cough medications, the highest amount of codeine allowed is 3.3 mg/ml.
