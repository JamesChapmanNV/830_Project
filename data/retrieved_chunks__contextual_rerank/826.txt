It wasn't until after these military conflicts that morphine habituation gained a reputation as the \"soldier's disease\" or the \"army disease\". With the addictive and habit forming properties of morphine now known the medical establishment was on the lookout for a less addictive alternative to morphine. This came in the form of diacetylmorphine or as it was later marketed, Heroin. Although it was later learned that heroin was not less addictive than codeine and in fact the contrary.

This is generally believed to be the first isolation of an active ingredient from a plant.[12][13] The active ingredient, was found to be 10 times as potent as opium. Sertürner originally named the substance morphium after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus, for its tendency to cause sleep.[14][15] Merck began marketing it commercially in 1827.[16] Morphine's clinical significance was not recognized by the greater medical community until 1831, when Sertürner was recognized for his contribution and granted the French equivalent of the Nobel Prize.
