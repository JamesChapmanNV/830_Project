Secondly: 50 times more CBD than THC is needed to reduce acute effects of THC,[26] which makes it practically impossible to administer proper dosage by inhalation. Also, the quantity of CBD converted into THC will increase a lot with the required ratio, and excessive harshness in the lungs may escalate a bad trip.\n\nToxicity and harm potential\n\nAccording to clinical studies, cannabidiol is well-tolerated and shows little to no toxicity.[27]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section summarizes current research on cannabidiol’s potential antipsychotic effects, risks associated with vaping or smoking CBD (notably the conversion to THC at high temperatures), and its overall low toxicity profile based on clinical studies, highlighting both therapeutic prospects and safety considerations within the broader overview of CBD's pharmacology and harm potential.\n                "}

And, if you're really concerned, recent non-human animal research suggests that most or all of the serotonin system reduction may be prevented by taking Prozac (fluoxetine) 0-6 hours after taking the MDMA (see McCann and Ricuarte in J. Clinical Psychopharmacology, 13 (3):pp. 214-217, 1993). One might speculate that other SSRI drugs (Zoloft, Paxil) may work too.
