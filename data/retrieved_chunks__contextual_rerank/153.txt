Early 1850s First experimentation with injecting medications. 1853 Hypodermic needle-syringes with a point fine enough to pierce the skin are invented simultaneously by Charles Gabriel Pravaz (French surgeon) and Alexander Wood (Scottish physician).  It is first used to inject morphine intravenously. 1861 Commercially manufactured hypodermic syringes are available in Europe and America.  (A Brief History of Cocaine) 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act is passed, regulating the labelling of products containing Alcohol, Opiates, Cocaine, and Cannabis, among others.  The law went into effect Jan 1, 1907 1 [Details] The act required correct labelling of products containing \"alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, heroin, alpha or beta eucaine, chloroform, cannabis indica, chloral hydrate, or acetanilide, or any derivative or preparation of any such substances contained therein.\"\n\nReferences\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides a historical overview of morphine, including its first isolation in 1806, development of hypodermic syringe technology in the 1850s, and key regulatory changes such as the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act.

After World War I, Merck's US unit was confiscated.  The company most people know today as Merck is no longer affiliated with Merck (KGaA) of Germany.  However at the time of the original MDMA patent, Merck was a single company. 1927 Merck chemist Max Oberlin conducts the first animal testing with MDMA while investigating 'adrenaline- or ephetonine-like' substances. 3 1953 The Army Chemical Center studied MDMA toxicity by giving MDMA to guinea pigs, rats, mice, monkeys, and dogs.  It is determined to be less toxic than MDA. 4 1965 Alexander Shulgin synthesizes MDMA but does not yet try it. 5 1967-1970 The first small underground batches of MDMA are synthesized. Some, but relatively few individuals have tried it at this point. 6 [Details] Erowid does not currently have clear documentation about when the first recreational use of MDMA occurred.

On the basis of chemical degradation and correlation with cannabinol, a general structure was proposed. In 1963, Raphael Mechoulam isolated CBD from Lebanese hashish and established its structure and relative stereochemistry.[7] Its absolute stereochemistry was determined in 1967.[7]\n\nAdulterated CBD-products\n\nAt least 128 samples out of more than 350 tested by government labs in nine states, nearly all in the South, had 371 types of synthetic cannabinoids in products marketed as CBD. Half of the 28 tested CBD-vape products contained less than 0.3% CBD.[8]\n\nChemistry\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides historical, cultural, and chemical background on cannabidiol (CBD), highlighting its first isolation in 1940, structural elucidation by Raphael Mechoulam in the 1960s, and issues with adulterated CBD products containing synthetic cannabinoids, relevant to understanding CBD's origins, chemistry, and quality concerns discussed in the broader document.\n                "}
