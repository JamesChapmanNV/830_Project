A methamphetamine overdose will likely also result in mild brain damage due to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotoxicity.[28][33] Death from fatal methamphetamine poisoning is typically preceded by convulsions and coma.[46]\n\nEmergency treatment\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the symptoms, risks, and emergency responses associated with methamphetamine overdose, highlighting its potential severity and the signs indicating toxic levels, which is crucial for understanding the drug's harm potential and safety considerations within the broader substance profile.\n                "}

These symptoms are sometimes referred to as withdrawal. Symptoms can include irritability, crying, sleep disturbances, tremors, jitteriness, trouble breathing, or muscle weakness. Not all babies exposed to a benzodiazepine will have symptoms. It is not known if the use of temazepam in pregnancy can cause symptoms in a newborn. It is important that your healthcare providers know you are taking temazepam so that if symptoms occur your baby can get the care that is best for them.\n\n◈ Can I take my benzodiazepine with diphenhydramine?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section addresses pregnancy-related concerns with temazepam, including potential withdrawal symptoms in newborns if used late in pregnancy, and possible interactions with other medications like diphenhydramine.
