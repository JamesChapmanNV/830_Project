If you experience any of these symptoms, sit down, rest, and drink some fruit juice, water, or a gatorade-type sports drink. In the unlikely event someone has a more severe reaction, e.g. loss of consciousness or seizures, get medical help as soon as possible.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears within the safety and overdose section of the MDMA FAQ, providing guidance on recognizing and responding to MDMA overdose symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, faintness, muscle cramps, and panic. It emphasizes immediate self-care and the importance of seeking medical help for severe reactions like loss of consciousness or seizures, critical for harm reduction information in the broader context of safe MDMA use.\n                "}

Activated charcoal may be administered to reduce gastrointestinal absorption while noting time-dependent efficacy. Intravenous fluids are essential for flushing the drug from the system while maintaining acid-base balance and electrolyte levels. Gastric lavage can be considered to remove stomach contents, and laxatives may be used to induce defecation, facilitating further elimination of the drug. Hemodialysis may enhance the clearance of both pethidine and its metabolite, normeperidine. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is the primary treatment for reversing opioid-induced effects. In cases of hypertension and hyperpyrexia, intravenous chlorpromazine can be administered. Following initial recovery, patients should be referred to addiction treatment programs to address the underlying addiction and support rehabilitation.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed emergency management protocols for pethidine overdose, including airway stabilization, gastrointestinal decontamination, supportive care, hemodialysis, opioid antagonists, and adjunctive treatments.
