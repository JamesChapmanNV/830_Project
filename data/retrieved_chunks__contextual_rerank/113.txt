DOI:10.5066/F71C1TWP\n\n12.1.3 Hepatotoxicity\n\nDespite wide scale use for many decades, oxycodone has not been convincingly linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. However, oxycodone and other opioid-acetaminophen combinations have become a common cause of acute liver injury, which is usually the result of excessive use of the medication for the opioid effect, which leads secondarily and unintentionally to an overdose of acetaminophen. In 2014, the FDA warned against the use of opioid combinations in which the dose of acetaminophen is greater than 325 mg per tablet or unit dose. Because of their potential for hepatotoxicity, opioid combinations in which the dose of acetaminophen is greater than 325 mg per tablet or capsule were discontinued.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the full webpage discusses oxycodone's classification as a pharmaceutical drug, highlighting its water-quality screening and hepatotoxicity considerations. It notes that while oxycodone rarely causes acute liver injury alone, opioid-acetaminophen combos pose a hepatotoxic risk, leading to FDA regulation changes in 2014. This information is relevant for understanding oxycodone's safety profile, regulatory status, and environmental impact within the comprehensive chemical data.\n                "}

Oxycodone by itself has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to clinically apparent liver injury. However, the combination of oxycodone with acetaminophen has been linked to many cases of acute liver failure caused by unintentional overdose with acetaminophen.\n\n7.3 Drug Classes\n\nBreast Feeding; Lactation; Milk, Human; Analgesics, Opioid; Narcotics; Antitussive Agents; Opiates\n\nOpioids\n\n7.4 FDA Medication Guides\n\n1 of 2\n\nDrug\n\nActive Ingredient\n\nForm;Route\n\nCompany\n\nDate\n\nDrug\n\nOXYCONTIN\n\nActive Ingredient\n\nOXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE\n\nForm;Route\n\nTABLET, EXTENDED RELEASE;ORAL\n\nCompany\n\nPURDUE PHARMA LP\n\nDate\n\n12/15/23\n\n2 of 2\n\nDrug\n\nActive Ingredient\n\nForm;Route\n\nCompany\n\nDate\n\nDrug\n\nXTAMPZA ER\n\nActive Ingredient\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information on oxycodone's FDA label, including its LiverTox summary indicating its safety profile related to liver injury and overdose risks, as well as drug classifications such as opioid analgesics and narcotics.
