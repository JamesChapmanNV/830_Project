She was discharged and found unresponsive the next morning. She was conveyed to a second hospital in full cardiopulmonary arrest and despite resuscitative efforts, was pronounced dead upon arrival. An autopsy was performed and postmortem specimens were submitted and screened for drugs using mainly chromatographic techniques. Quantitation was achieved by gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detection. Confirmation was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Oxycodone was the only drug detected in the following concentrations: heart blood, 1.36 mg/L; gastric contents, 7.33 mg in 33 mL (222.34 mg/L); liver, 0.2 mg/kg; and urine, 47.23 mg/L (47,230 ng/mL).\n\nPMID:15577525\n\nArmstrong EJ et al; Am J Forensic Med Pathol 25 (4): 338-41 (2004)\n\n7.15 Drug Tolerance\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt reports a forensic case involving fatal oxycodone poisoning in a child, with detected concentrations in blood, gastric content, liver, and urine, highlighting oxycodone's toxicity and potential for overdose.

Here we report two cases of fatal intravenous injection of the content from fentanyl patches. Both were male drug addicts, found dead within a one week interval in the same apartment. Post-mortem femoral blood was screened for amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opioids with immunological methods (EMIT II) and further with headspace gas chromatography for alcohol and with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for different drugs, including fentanyl. ... In the first case, the toxicological analysis revealed fentanyl (2.7 ng/mL), morphine (31.4 ng/mL), and ethanol (1.1 g/L) in postmortem blood and amphetamine, cannabinoids, morphine, and ethanol (1.4 g/L) in postmortem urine. In the second case, the analysis revealed fentanyl (13.8 ng/mL), 7-aminoclonazepam (57.1 ng/mL), and sertralin (91.9 ng/mL) in postmortem blood and a small amount of ethanol (0.1 g/L) in postmortem urine. ...\n\nPMID:15568716\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details forensic case reports of fatal intravenous fentanyl injection from patches, with postmortem blood analyses showing fentanyl concentrations of 2.7 and 13.8 ng/mL, respectively, alongside other drugs like morphine, ethanol, and benzodiazepines.
