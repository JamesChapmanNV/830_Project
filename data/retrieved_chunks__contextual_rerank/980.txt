A 2.0 mL sample of umbilical venous blood was collected from the placenta after delivery of the baby. The sample was analyzed using RIA method to measure free morphine. Details about the labor and baby's condition at birth were recorded. The concentration of free morphine in the umbilical venous blood was significantly associated with the dose-delivery interval (coefficient (95% CI)=1.08(0.99-1.18), p<0.001). Twenty neonates had low Apgar score (< or =7) at 1 min. The odds of such a low score were raised with higher log free morphine in the cord venous plasma, but not statistically significantly (OR (95% CI)=5.3 (0.84-34), p=0.08). Fourteen neonates required resuscitation. The odds of requiring resuscitation were significantly raised with higher log free morphine: OR (95% CI)=9.3 (1.0-86), p=0.05.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details a human exposure study investigating neonatal outcomes after maternal intramuscular diamorphine (diamorphine is pharmacologically equivalent to morphine) administration during labor. It reports measurements of free morphine levels in umbilical cord blood, their association with delivery timing, and their impact on neonatal Apgar scores and resuscitation needs, highlighting the clinical relevance of maternal morphine exposure on neonatal health.\n                "}
