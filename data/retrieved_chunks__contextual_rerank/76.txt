[In Canada you will have no difficulty buying codeine. Not only are there no forms to sign, but no questions are usually asked. In the US some paternalistic pharmacists will not sell if they don't like your looks.] The amount of codeine allowable by law in OTC products is 8 mg per unit dose of a drug. A example is 325 mg of acetaminophen/paracetamol (a unit dose of acetaminophen) and 8 mg codeine per tablet. This law is used to prevent the excessive use of codeine as one would have to take doses reaching toxicity of acetaminophen before any real problems with the codeine administration would occur. It's the same situation with aspirin. With OTC cough medications, the highest amount of codeine allowed is 3.3 mg/ml. This concentration is _so_ low that this FAQ will not be discussing cough syrups as a source of recreational codeine.

A heavy feeling in the limbs also becomes quite noticeable. This will peak at 1hr with the effects slowly tapering off after 2hr. Due to the difficulty in obtaining Rx drugs containing enough codeine to be used recreationally, I have included a procedure that allows one to extract the codeine from OTC products to obtain enough of the drug to use recreationally. This extraction can *only* be used on OTC products containing either acetaminophen or aspirin in addition to the codeine. There is one exception to this rule. Products containing caffeine can be used with the knowledge that the most of the caffeine contained in the OTC product, *will* be found in the finished product. This should not matter to most people, but to those with problems in taking caffeine, *you have been warned*!
