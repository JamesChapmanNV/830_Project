I am not sure what the cause of this is, but its most likely some form of oil, either formed in the reaction or left over from a very poor solvent. It may or may not be harmless depending upon what it is. This oil is often removed with acetone, but ethyl-ether would be better suited for this as it dries faster. Pure methamphetamine HCl melts at around 170c (338f ). The crystals can be carefully chopped and mixed with sodium carbonate, and when the resulting powder is heated (and the methamphetamine HCl melts) CO2 and methamphetamine base vapor is given off. This is probably one of the more effective ways of smoking meth if you are careful, however the hydrochloride salt is often the form smoked as the base form is often an oil and is difficult to store, transport, and work with. Smoking the HCl form is OK if you don't mind a small quantity of pyrolysed drug. d-methamphetamine is, by nature,\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the physical appearance and handling of methamphetamine, noting waxy, wet-looking \"speed\" caused by residual oils from synthesis or poor solvents. It explains methods for removing impurities with acetone or ether, describes melting points of pure HCl salts, and details how vaporization of melted crystals with sodium carbonate produces vapor for smoking, highlighting differences between free base and salt forms for storage and use.\n                "}

Chronic cocaine use can lead to the development of nasal septum perforation , which may progress to a more severe condition known as cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions (CIMDL). Contaminated currency such as banknotes might serve as a fomite of diseases like hepatitis C [47] Short-term side effects of insufflation includes nasal congestion, which may last for 24 hours. Frequent insufflation of some substances can damage one's mucous membranes, induce bleeding, damage the nostril's cartilage and lining, burn the throat, and cause other trauma to the nasal passage and sinus area. [48] A nasal septum perforation is a medical condition in which the nasal septum, the bony/cartilaginous wall dividing the nasal cavities, develops a hole or fissure. To reduce damage, it is recommended to grind the substance completely before use and alternate nostrils.

Mostly the dangers are more subtle - a type of psychic dependence on ketamine, paranoia, and egocentricism. Many people who use ketamine heavily experience a new perspective on the world which seems to be quite egocentric and conspiratorial. Ketamine can increase one's sense of connection between events, synchronicities, etc. This, when interpreted in certain common ways, can lead people to believe that external events revolve around themselves (\"if that happened that way, and this happened this way, both of these things must be about me\"), and then, further, that people and events are working in some heretofore unseen concert, which may be either sinister or just novel.
