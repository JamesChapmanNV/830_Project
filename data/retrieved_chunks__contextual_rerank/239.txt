While traditional psychedelics such as LSA , ayahuasca and mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, some users claim that LSD tends to go straight into Level 8A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, LSD is relatively limited in depth, at doses that do not come with excessive side effects.\n- External hallucination ( autonomous entities ; settings, sceneries, and landscapes ; perspective hallucinations and scenarios and plots )\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses LSD's visual hallucination effects, highlighting that LSD can produce internal hallucinations with vividness comparable to psilocybin or DMT, though these are less consistent and often limited in depth compared to other psychedelics.
