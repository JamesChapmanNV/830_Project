The effects of oxycodone on performance peaked at 1.5 hr when it prolonged reaction time and impaired vigilance, attention, body balance and coordination of extraocular muscles. The subjects assessed themselves mentally slow, muzzy and impaired by performance on visual analogue scales still 3 hr after injection. Critical flicker discrimination was impaired and some respiratory depression still present at 4.5 hr after administration. Oxycodone elevated plasma prolactin at 1.5 and 3 hr while growth hormone levels remained unaffected. We conclude that the profile of psychomotor decrement produced by this mu-opioid agonist closely resembles that of agonist-antagonist analgesics.\n\nPMID:2555803\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details human exposure study findings on oxycodone's psychomotor effects, showing it impairs reaction time, vigilance, attention, balance, and coordination with effects peaking at 1.5 hours and lasting several hours. It highlights oxycodone's impact on cognitive and respiratory functions, crucial for understanding its safety profile within the broader context of its pharmacology, toxicity, and safety hazards discussed in the full document.

Problematic use is sometimes accompanied by paranoia, an increase in the sense of synchronicity in daily experiences, and egocentrism (the world revolves around the user). With compulsive use, a user may also have impaired judgment with respect to what activities or contexts are appropriate while under the influence (e.g. driving a car, going to a job, or taking a bath), which can increase the risk of accidents. As with any addictive substance, it's a good idea to set hard limits about maximum use and types of use before it becomes a problem.\n\nUrinary Tract Problems:6\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses potential health risks associated with ketamine use, specifically focusing on addictive behaviors and urinary tract problems. It provides guidance on recognizing problematic patterns and emphasizes the importance of moderation, making it relevant to those seeking comprehensive safety information within the broader context of ketamine dosage, effects, and precautions.\n                "}
