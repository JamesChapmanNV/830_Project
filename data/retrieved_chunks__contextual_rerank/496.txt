Some studies on opioids as a general group have found more problems with learning and behavior in children exposed to opioids for a long period of time during pregnancy. It is hard to tell if this is due to the medication exposure or other factors that may increase the chances of these problems.\n\n◈ What if I have an opioid use disorder?\n\nStudies find that people who are pregnant and take opioids in higher doses or for longer than recommended by their healthcare providers (i.e. misuse or “abuse” opioids) have an increased chance for pregnancy problems. These include poor growth of the baby, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and need for a C-section.\n\n◈ What screenings or tests are available to see if my pregnancy has birth defects or other issues?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides information on the potential long-term effects of hydrocodone use during pregnancy, including impacts on child behavior and learning, risks associated with maternal opioid misuse, and available prenatal screening options.
