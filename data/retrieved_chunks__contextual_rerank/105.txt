These patterns indicate that, in accidental deaths, any number of strategies are being used by patients who engage in codeine misuse, including supplementing codeine with prescribed pain medication, persistently escalating dosages without clinician approval, and selling/buying the drug outside of regulatory control. Therefore, a clear need exists for specialist intervention for pain management in a complex patient population.\n\nMaximum Tolerated Dose\n\nImmediate-release preparation: 360 mg per day\n\nControlled-release preparation: 600 mg per day\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the behavior and risks associated with codeine misuse in vulnerable populations, emphasizing patterns like escalating doses and drug trading that contribute to accidental deaths.

A heavy feeling in the limbs also becomes quite noticeable. This will peak at 1hr with the effects slowly tapering off after 2hr. Due to the difficulty in obtaining Rx drugs containing enough codeine to be used recreationally, I have included a procedure that allows one to extract the codeine from OTC products to obtain enough of the drug to use recreationally. This extraction can *only* be used on OTC products containing either acetaminophen or aspirin in addition to the codeine. There is one exception to this rule. Products containing caffeine can be used with the knowledge that the most of the caffeine contained in the OTC product, *will* be found in the finished product. This should not matter to most people, but to those with problems in taking caffeine, *you have been warned*!
