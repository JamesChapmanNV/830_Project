This makes it extremely tough and uncomfortable to move.\n\nRestless leg syndrome - Restless legs are very prominent and arguably one of the most uncomfortable side effects of diphenhydramine. It can also last for days after the experience and can even be chronic when it is abused repeatedly.\n\nTactile enhancement - This results in increased feelings of touch, pain, warmth and orgasms. It is usually only present at the peak and not during the come up or come down.\n\nTactile suppression - Diphenhydramine produces feelings of numbness throughout the body. This is attributed to its ability to block sodium channels within the nerves.[10]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details diphenhydramine's physical tactile effects, including sensations of electricity, body heaviness, restless legs, and alterations in touch, pain, and temperature sensitivity. These effects are key components of its overall subjective profile, emphasizing its unpredictable and uncomfortable physical sensations associated with deliriant and anticholinergic actions. Understanding these effects is crucial for harm reduction and recognizing adverse physical experiences during use.\n                "}

It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).
