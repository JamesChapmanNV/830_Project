The preparations fall under Schedule V because of their low dose per unit and low total amount per package. We have been able to confirm most of them, but the list might include Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Georgia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Mississippi, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.\n\nArkansas #\n\nArkansas allows pharmacists to sell low dose codeine cough syrup without a prescription.

Muscle contractions Nausea - This effect is most commonly present during the come up phase of the experience, and at higher doses, but has been reported to occur spontaneously in those who seem to be susceptible to it. This is likely due to the large number of serotonin receptors occurring in the gut. Neurotoxicity - Long-term use can lead to a significant degree of neurotoxicity. Consequences like this are the primary reason the use of MDMA should be delegated to only several times a year at most. Protracted symptoms of depression or anhedonia are fairly common with excessively frequent use. Pain relief - This effect is generally not as powerful as it is with opioids .
