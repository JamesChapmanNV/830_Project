Safety and Neurotoxicity Discussion\n\nBehavioral Safety Concerns\n\nAs noted, a primary psychological effect of MDMA is to make the user feel \"safe\", at peace with the world, pleasantly reconciled to things as they are, and things however they will be. This can remarkably diminish one's ability to make sound judgements during the session. Examples:\n\nIt becomes easy to want to prolong the MDMA state by taking more and more of the drug (or of other drugs), beyond what you would judge wise or worthwhile when not under its influence.\n\nIt becomes easier to have unsafe sex. You may \"forget,\" judge that the risk of infection is very small, or feel that infection wouldn't be such a terrible thing after all. If you think you might have sex while on MDMA, it may help you and your partner to stay safe if you lay out safer sex supplies before dosing in a place you'll be sure to see them later, and agree beforehand that you'll use them if the occasion arises.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides an important overview of safety and neurotoxicity considerations related to MDMA use, emphasizing behavioral safety concerns such as impaired judgment, risk of unsafe sex, and the potential neurological and psychological effects discussed in the overall document.\n                "}

At 0.45 mg/kg the \"subjects' experiences were strong, fully psychedelic. They could get out of bed but didn't want to.\" And at 0.9 mg/kg \"they were pretty immobilized, but in touch with [researchers] when [they] needed to make contact.\" (R. Strassman, personal communication). A .45 mg/kg dose would be around 30 mg for a 150 pound person.\n\nFischer and Thatcher administered .16 mg/kg to subjects and described it as \"mildly hallucinogenic\" and \"a dose which in most cases induces mild hallucinations in only some subjects\". This dose caused small changes in visual perception, handwriting, and ability/willingness to perform dull tests.
