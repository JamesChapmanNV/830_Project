She had complete recovery and was discharged from the ED after a 4-hour observation period. Serum testing with liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC 1260 QTOF/MS 6550; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) confirmed the presence of the medications the patient reported receiving, and additionally fentanyl (15.2 ng/mL) and U-47700 (7.6 ng/mL). In this case report, street Norco purchased in Central California resulted in altered mental status requiring naloxone reversal because of fentanyl and the novel synthetic opioid U-47700. Because these compounds are not detected by routine urine drug testing and physical examination findings are similar to those of a traditional opioid toxidrome, emergency providers should use the patient's history and other circumstantial details to aid in diagnosis. In cases with suspicion of opioid or opioid analogue cause, we recommend that emergency providers contact their local poison control center,\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a case report involving street-acquired Norco containing fentanyl and U-47700, highlighting challenges in detection due to these substances' absence in routine tests and their similar clinical presentation to traditional opioids. Its relevance emphasizes the importance of thorough history and circumstantial evidence in emergency diagnosis and the need for specialized testing for synthetic opioids. It underscores ongoing issues with illicit fentanyl compounds and the importance of targeted toxicological analysis within the broader context of fentanyl-related drug toxicity and overdose management.\n                "}

A sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was suspected, whereas a traumatic cause of death was excluded regarding autopsy findings. Specimens were submitted to a large toxicological analysis, which included ethanol measurement by HS-GC-FID, a targeted screening for drugs of abuse and various prescription drug classes followed by quantification using UPLC-MS/MS methods. Methadone and its metabolite (EDDP) were detected in all the tested fluids, as well as in hair, with a blood concentration of methadone considered as lethal for children (73 ng/mL). The cause of death was determined to be acute \"methadone poisoning\", and the manner of death was \"accidental\".
