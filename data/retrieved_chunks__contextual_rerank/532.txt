Combined with the extra energy the drug gives, it becomes easy to sustain bruises, blisters, or other bodily damage from extensive dancing, hiking, climbing, etc., without noticing it until after the damage is done. Under MDMA, it may seem \"right\" to make immediate changes in relationships (increasing or decreasing commitment) of all kinds. The fresh points of view appreciated during an MDMA session are one of the drug's most prized benefits, but it is probably unwise to actually make lasting relationship changes until you have a chance to see how you feel about them after the drug and its afterglow wear off.\n\nNeurotoxicity?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses safety concerns related to MDMA, focusing on reduced pain awareness that can lead to unintentional bodily harm from activities like dancing or climbing, and warns against making significant relationship decisions during or immediately after MDMA use, emphasizing the importance of post-session reflection.\n                "}

Safety and Neurotoxicity Discussion\n\nBehavioral Safety Concerns\n\nAs noted, a primary psychological effect of MDMA is to make the user feel \"safe\", at peace with the world, pleasantly reconciled to things as they are, and things however they will be. This can remarkably diminish one's ability to make sound judgements during the session. Examples:\n\nIt becomes easy to want to prolong the MDMA state by taking more and more of the drug (or of other drugs), beyond what you would judge wise or worthwhile when not under its influence.\n\nIt becomes easier to have unsafe sex. You may \"forget,\" judge that the risk of infection is very small, or feel that infection wouldn't be such a terrible thing after all. If you think you might have sex while on MDMA, it may help you and your partner to stay safe if you lay out safer sex supplies before dosing in a place you'll be sure to see them later, and agree beforehand that you'll use them if the occasion arises.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides an important overview of safety and neurotoxicity considerations related to MDMA use, emphasizing behavioral safety concerns such as impaired judgment, risk of unsafe sex, and the potential neurological and psychological effects discussed in the overall document.\n                "}

The Procedure 1. Obtain a quantity of tablets containing codeine, check to see if they contain anything other than codeine, caffeine, acetaminophen or aspirin. If they do, and you don't know whether or not it will be a problem, your best bet is not to use them. Measure out your desired amount of codeine (ex. 64 mg = 8 tablets * 8 mg/tablet). You may want to add 2 extra tablets as it is quite likely you will lose some codeine in the procedure. As you get more experience with the procedure you will be able to get approx. 95% of the codeine extracted. 2. Measure out some nice hot water, use approx. 40 ml / 20 tablets or more if needed. I would suggest you don't go over 50 ml for 20 tablets. I don't know if the use of boiling water would destroy any of the codeine but your best bet is not to use it. Use hot water but not boiling. Make sure the tablets dissolve completely.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a step-by-step procedure for extracting codeine from OTC tablets, emphasizing measuring a desired dose, using hot water (not boiling), and filtering the solution.
