Temazepam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It is sold under the brand name Restoril®.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. If you take this medication regularly and then suddenly stop taking it (called “cold turkey”), you could have withdrawal symptoms. It is not known what effects, if any, withdrawal could have on a pregnancy.The product label for temazepam recommends people who are pregnant not use this medication during pregnancy.

The Procedure 1. Obtain a quantity of tablets containing codeine, check to see if they contain anything other than codeine, caffeine, acetaminophen or aspirin. If they do, and you don't know whether or not it will be a problem, your best bet is not to use them. Measure out your desired amount of codeine (ex. 64 mg = 8 tablets * 8 mg/tablet). You may want to add 2 extra tablets as it is quite likely you will lose some codeine in the procedure. As you get more experience with the procedure you will be able to get approx. 95% of the codeine extracted. 2. Measure out some nice hot water, use approx. 40 ml / 20 tablets or more if needed. I would suggest you don't go over 50 ml for 20 tablets. I don't know if the use of boiling water would destroy any of the codeine but your best bet is not to use it. Use hot water but not boiling. Make sure the tablets dissolve completely.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a step-by-step procedure for extracting codeine from OTC tablets, emphasizing measuring a desired dose, using hot water (not boiling), and filtering the solution.
