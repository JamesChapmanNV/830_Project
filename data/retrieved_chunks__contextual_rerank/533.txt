Two juvenile females were discovered unresponsive and hypoxic by a male acquaintance. The trio had reportedly crushed and snorted Opana ER tablets and consumed Xanax for recreational purposes. Emergency personnel were able to stabilize one female. The second female was pronounced dead at the scene. Blood and urine samples from the surviving female were collected at the trauma center between 48 and 96 hr post incident. Toxicology results showed the presence of oxymorphone, doxylamine, dextromethorphan, alprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, oxazepam, and temazepam in her urine. No drugs were detected in her blood. Toxicology on the deceased female revealed the presence of 0.13 mg/L oxymorphone and 0.04 mg/L alprazolam in her blood. Gastric contents contained 0.25 and 0.93 mg/L of oxymorphone and alprazolam, respectively.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section summarizes case reports of illicit abuse and overdose involving extended-release oxymorphone (Opana ER), often combined with other substances like alprazolam, highlighting toxicology findings and fatal outcomes. It provides critical real-world data on postmortem drug levels and the dangers associated with recreational use of oxymorphone tablets.\n                "}

This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nOxymorphone can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).\n\nOpioid overdoses can be treated by calling the local emergency number and administering an opioid antagonist such as naloxone.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the risks of overdose from oxymorphone, highlighting respiratory depression, danger of aspiration leading to suffocation, and the importance of harm reduction practices such as positioning and naloxone treatment, within the broader context of toxicity and safe usage of the drug.\n                "}
