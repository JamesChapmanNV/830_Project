Most users consider this to be a waste of their tripping experience, especially as it can make them sick to their stomachs. While fatalities caused by the direct pharmacological effects of ketamine are nearly unheard of at normal recreational doses, ketamine is a powerful anaesthetic and being anaesthetized, semi-conscious, or unconscious carries distinct risks. Body positions that restrict breathing or blood-flow (e.g. \"child's pose\" or face down into a pillow) can result in serious injury or death even if the person is conscious. Extreme care should be taken before combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, opiates, barbiturates, and/or benzodiazepines. This can be very dangerous. While most (if not all) of these combinations have been used without negative incident, this does NOT mean that they should be considered safe. Opiates/opioids such as heroin are\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the ketamine FAQ discusses the risks and dangers of overdose, highlighting that while fatalities from direct effects are rare, severe injury or death can occur if body positions restrict breathing or blood flow. It emphasizes extreme caution when combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, or opioids, and underscores the importance of understanding these risks within the broader context of safe recreational use and health concerns detailed in the full document.\n                "}

This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nOxymorphone can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).\n\nOpioid overdoses can be treated by calling the local emergency number and administering an opioid antagonist such as naloxone.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the risks of overdose from oxymorphone, highlighting respiratory depression, danger of aspiration leading to suffocation, and the importance of harm reduction practices such as positioning and naloxone treatment, within the broader context of toxicity and safe usage of the drug.\n                "}
