Drink water frequently during the MDMA session, and moreso if you're physically active. Under the influence, time can pass surprisingly quickly. It is useful if trip guides or trip buddies remind each other to drink water often. For those who are concerned about the possibility of serotonin level or serotonin system changes in humans with therapeutic doses of MDMA, some researchers reckon changes can be lessened or prevented by taking antioxidants. In an article titled \"Phenethylamines, Free Radicals, and Antioxidants\" (MAPS Newsletter, Volume IV Number 1), author Brian Leibovitz suggests in Table 1 taking as a preventive measure the following: 5 mg B-Carotene; 2 grams Bioflavonoids; 100 mg Coenzyme Q10; 2-4 grams L-Ascorbic acid; 1 gram L-Carnitine; 2 grams N-Acetylcysteine (NAC); 250 ug Selenium, and 1,000 IU Vitamin E. \"There is nothing magic about the doses listed; it is my best estimate based on present knowledge in nutrition.\"\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides safety advice for MDMA users, emphasizing the importance of staying well hydrated during use and discussing potential neuroprotective strategies. It highlights research suggesting antioxidants may reduce serotonin system changes, listing specific supplements and dosages recommended by MAPS researcher Brian Leibovitz, enhancing guidance on harm reduction within the broader context of MDMA safety and effects.\n                "}

The last few notes about Niacin and Vitamin C are based on a paperback edition of Hoffer & Osmonds \"The Psychedelics\" It's pretty clear that the latin names of this plant are somewhat confused (which is typical). Ipomoea purpurea, Ipomoea tricolor, Ipomoea violacea and Ipomoea rubro-caerulea are all the same plant. The other variety of morning glory, \"Ololiuhqui\" has at least two Latin names as well: Turbina corymbosa, and Rivea corymbosa. \"Recreational use of Ergoline Alkaloids from Argyreia Nervosa\" William E.
