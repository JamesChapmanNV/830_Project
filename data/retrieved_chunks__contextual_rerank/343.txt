Short-term memory loss is affected in a manner similar to cannabis . Amnesia - At higher dosages, diphenhydramine can cause a complete halt of external information processing, which can make the user unable to perform simple tasks or make decisions. Motivation suppression - Diphenhydramine can cause a complete loss of motivation to do almost anything. This is often accompanied by depression and can make the user extremely bored and restless. Psychosis Thought deceleration Thought disorganization Time distortion - Although not extreme, time dilation is definitely felt and can be overwhelming if the user is having a difficult trip.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the cognitive and psychological effects of diphenhydramine, including strong memory suppression, amnesia at high doses, and effects on motivation such as loss of drive and emotional difficulties.
