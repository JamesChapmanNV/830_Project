In addition, he was taking the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs, sertraline and venlafaxine as prescribed. Methadone is also a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor which has been involved in serotonin toxicity reactions. Initially, no symptoms of narcotic overdose (depressed central nervous system, respiration, or blood pressure) could be distinguished, and the standard narcotic urine screen was negative. No decontamination or antagonist therapy was given, and the patient was discharged to a psychiatric unit for observation. At 5 hours post-ingestion he presented in a panic with hallucinations and elevated blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. These symptoms are characteristic of serotonin syndrome which is often described as mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities.

It emphasizes the delayed onset of severe symptoms such as hallucinations, hypertension, and neuromuscular abnormalities following ingestion, and illustrates the drug’s serotonin re-uptake inhibition role in overdose scenarios.\n                "}

Psychological factors - sadness at returning to an ordinary state of consciousness after ecstasy - may also account for feeling down for a while. In any event, most users report the opposite: feelings of well-being or gentle euphoria in the days following an MDMA session. To get a better understanding of why the serotonin system may be critical to normalcy for some individuals and less so for others, see Listening to Prozac by Peter D. Kramer (Viking 1993). The entire book is worthwhile, but note pages 134-136 especially. There is solid experimental evidence that MDMA, administered in large doses and/or repeatedly, causes partial loss of serotonergic neurons in laboratory animals. Uncertain is whether this loss is permanent, reversible, or important.
