Opiates include all naturally occurring drugs with morphine-like effects such as codeine and all semi and fully synthetic drugs with morphine-like effects such as heroin and meperidine (Demerol). Codeine was first discovered as a natural constituent of opium in very small concentrations, in the range of 0.7% - 2.5% by weight. Most codeine found in pharmaceutical products today is synthetically produced via the methylation of morphine. Codeine is available by prescription only in most areas of the US. Exceptions are seen in some states where codeine can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) in products containing a small dose of codeine. Also in Canada, some codeine containing products are available OTC in most if not all provinces. With the codeine available in the US OTC, release forms may have to be signed, including your name and address, in order to keep track of how much codeine you are buying. [In Canada you will have no difficulty\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of codeine, including its classification as an opiate, natural occurrence in opium, synthetic production methods, and legal status in the US and Canada. It highlights the small concentrations in opium, the distinction between prescription and OTC availability, and the requirements for purchasing OTC products. This information is relevant for understanding the drug's background, legal framework, and potential for recreational extraction within the larger webpage focused on drugs, chemicals, and their properties.\n                "}

The taste isn't really bad but it's similar to sucking on a lemon. (One gets used to the taste after a while.:)) 6. Sit back and wait for the effects. Because the codeine is already in solution it only needs to be absorbed, while codeine in the tablet form must dissolve before being absorbed. Because of this, the effects will probably become noticeable within 15min.

That way you can dissolve 20 tablets in 50 ml of hot water, cool the water down to 10C, filter the solution and end up with the same amount of codeine as the tablets contained but only a fraction of the original amount of A/A. It must be noted that because most of the caffeine will also be in the finished product, using large amount of tablets in the following procedure will result in large amount of caffeine in the finished product. For example the use of 20 tablets will result in about 300 mg of caffeine in the finished product (15 mg/tablets * 20 tablets). I personally haven't experienced any adverse reactions due to this amount of caffeine. Because of codeine's sedative effects the \"jitters\" and other adverse effects of large amount of caffeine are not experienced. The Procedure 1.

It highlights that most caffeine remains in the final product, with an example indicating about 300 mg of caffeine from 20 tablets. The section concludes with instructions for obtaining tablets containing codeine for this process.\n                "}
