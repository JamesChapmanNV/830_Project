Codeine is a prodrug, itself inactive, but demethylated to the active morphine by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 to morphine. 70-80% of the dose undergoes glucuronidation to form codeine-6-glucuronide. This process is mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT2B7 and UGT2B4. 5-10% of the dose undergoes O-demethylation to morphine and 10% undergoes N-demethylation to form norcodeine. CYP2D6 mediates the biotransformation to morphine. CYP3A4 is the enzymes that mediates the conversion to norcodiene. Morphine and norcodeine are further metabolized and undergo glucuronidation. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Both morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are active and have analgesic activity. Norcodiene and M3G do not have any analgesic properties. Route of Elimination: 90% of the total dose of codeine is excreted through the kidneys, of which 10% is unchanged codeine.

It discusses the roles of enzymes CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7 and UGT2B4 in these processes, as well as routes of excretion and elimination half-life.
