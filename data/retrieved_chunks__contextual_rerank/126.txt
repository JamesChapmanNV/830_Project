Janssen developed fentanyl by assaying analogues of the structurally related substance pethidine for opioid activity.[14] The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate which entered the clinical practice as a general anesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s. Following this, many other fentanyl analogues were developed and introduced into medical practice, including sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section covers key topics on fentanyl's safety and legal considerations, including its addiction potential, dangerous drug interactions, and legal status across countries.
