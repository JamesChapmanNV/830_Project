Those using MDMA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength should be extremely careful. Based on research from multiple labs, the effects of MDMA can increase non-linearly with increases in dosage. That is, increasing dosage from 100mg to 120mg (a 20% increase in dosage) can cause more than a 20% increase in experiential effects level. See Harris DS, Baggott M, et al. 2002 and de la Torre R, Farre M, et al. 2000. The current theory is that some metabolic pathway becomes saturated/overwhelmed somewhere around 1.5mg/kg and above, resulting in higher plasma levels and effects levels. The specific metabolic reason for this non-linearity has not yet been proven.\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the potential risks and effects of MDMA, including neurotoxicity and rare death occurrences, and emphasizes the importance of caution due to individual sensitivity and non-linear dosage effects, providing critical safety information within the broader MDMA effects overview.\n                "}

Two reports concern mixed drugs fatalities. In one case, ketamine had only a minor role. For the remaining six cases, insufficient details were available to be evaluated properly. In the three cases involving only ketamine, the routes of administration were intramuscular or intravenous and the cause of death was mainly overdose (multiple intramuscular doses or accidental intravenous overdose), in line with preclinical findings. In the other cases involving ketamine mixed with other drugs, the observed lower ketamine concentrations indicate that drug interaction may have contributed to these deaths. Substances with CNS/respiratory depressant effects, like ethanol, opioids, barbiturates and benzodiazepines, or drugs with cardiostimulant effects, like cocaine or amphetamines, may increase ketamine acute toxicity.
