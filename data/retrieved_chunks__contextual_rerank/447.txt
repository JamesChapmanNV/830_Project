However, there is currently no clinical evidence supporting this claim.\n- Auditory distortion - Sounds may appear \"tinny\" or \"alien\". More likely at higher doses.  Certain subjective reports mention flanging, delays/echoing, reverb -like effects, similar to those found in music.\n- Auditory hallucination - Typically present at higher doses. Not as common as visual hallucinations, but may occur alongside them.\nMulti-sensory effects: - Synaesthesia - True synesthesia is rare and non-reproducible, although users often describe the feeling of being able to \"hear colors\" and \"see sounds\". Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of occurrence, but seems to primarily occur in those who are already predisposed to synesthetic states.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details LSD's auditory and multi-sensory effects, including reports of enhanced hearing, distortions such as \"tinny\" sounds and reverb, as well as higher-dose hallucinations.

For some users, an enhanced comprehension of subtle details in the music or a feeling of deeper understanding with regards to composition and lyrics has been reported what is essentially less common compared to many other hallucinogenic compounds. The overall effect is, for the most part mainly indicative of an all-around increased enthusiasm towards hearing music in general.
