It is advisable to become familiar with the many ways of synthesizing methcathinone from (pseudo)ephedrine, as just such a procedure can be used on freshly produced methamphetamine to verify that the (pseudo)ephedrine was in fact reduced. The smell of basic methcathinone has been reported to resemble that of \"pistachio ice cream\". Suffice to say that it is sweet, pleasant, and to a cat-head, nirvana.
