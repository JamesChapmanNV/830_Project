Studies have found that following your treatment plan for opioid use disorder can help increase the chances of a healthy pregnancy and baby. People who stop taking the medication used to treat opioid use disorder often have a relapse into misusing opioids again. Misusing opioids (using in greater amounts than recommended by a healthcare provider or using an opioid without a prescription) could cause pregnancy complications.Because of how the body changes during pregnancy, your healthcare provider might talk with you about changing your methadone dose during the pregnancy.\n\n◈ I take methadone.

One ketamine user recommends that people set a limit on use *before* ever trying it so they can have a benchmark against which to judge usage levels. Write down the limits. What do you think a reasonable maximum usage would be: once per month? once per week? twice per day? Check in regularly with pre-K usage limits and (if possible) have someone who can be confided in about use and who can act as an external sanity check. While not common, it is not unusual for people to fall into patterns of use much higher than they expected. John Lilly is a classic example of a person who ended up using A LOT of ketamine, but there are many others. Using once per day or more may also cause long-term problems. We have received at least one report of a person who used ketamine once to twice per day for six months, and a year and a half later felt that he had done permanent damage to himself, experiencing persistent flashes and streaks in his vision.
