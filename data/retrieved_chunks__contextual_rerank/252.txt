Symptoms can include trouble eating, sleeping too little or too much, having floppy (poor) muscle control or tight muscles, being jittery, and / or having a hard time breathing. Withdrawal symptoms usually go away within a few weeks but can last for a few months. The baby might need to be admitted to the special care nursery (NICU). It is important that your healthcare providers know you are taking methamphetamine so that if symptoms occur your baby can get the care that is best for them.\n\n◈ Does taking methamphetamine in pregnancy affect future behavior or learning for the child?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses the potential neonatal withdrawal and long-term behavioral effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure, providing critical information for understanding the drug's impact during pregnancy and its implications for infant health outcomes within the comprehensive pharmacological and safety profile presented in the full document.\n                "}

The DLPA-crank may in fact only be dl-amphetamine. Might be 100% cut [read: nothing] also...\n\nSame as Vicks: You've been ripped off ! -or- there's so much unchanged ephedrine as to cancel the dextrorotary effects of the meth (l-ephedrine, when reduced, is dextrorotary (see explanation elsewhere)\n\nOpposite of vicks compared to water: DL-methamphetamine. Dextrorotary product is almost certainly methamphetamine (or extracted dexedrines?) as its is not worth the trouble to get other dextrorotary precursors or resolve dl-amphetamine...\n\nWorth Noting: Cathinone and Methcathinone, when dissolved in methanol, will become racemic due to the nature of the molecule (keytone). I'm not sure what other conditions cause this but I am aware that it happens easily, so methcathinone from the black market is almost definitely racemic...\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the interpretation of optical activity and chirality in various methamphetamine preparations, highlighting how water, Vicks inhaler extract, and other sources can produce different enantiomeric forms.
