Treat coma, seizures, hyperthermia, and atypical ventricular tachycardia if they occur. Monitor the patient for at least 6 to 8 hours after ingestion. Specific drugs and antidotes: There is no specific antidote for antihistamine overdose. As for anticholinergic poisoning, physostigmine has been used for treatment of severe delirium or tachycardia. However because antihistamine overdose carry a greater risk for seizures physostigmine is not recommended routinely. Sodium bicarbonate may be useful for myocardial depression ... . Decontamination: Administer activated charcoal orally if conditions are appropriate. Gastric lavage is not necessary after small to moderate ingestions if activated charcoal can be given promptly.
