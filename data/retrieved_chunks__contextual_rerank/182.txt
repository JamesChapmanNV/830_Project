However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. If you take this medication regularly and then suddenly stop taking it (called “cold turkey”), you could have withdrawal symptoms. It is not known what effects, if any, withdrawal could have on a pregnancy.The product label for temazepam recommends people who are pregnant not use this medication during pregnancy.
