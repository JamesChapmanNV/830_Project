Seeds from plants grown in one's own garden will be safe as long as you do not spray them with insecticides. The last few notes about Niacin and Vitamin C are based on a paperback edition of Hoffer & Osmonds \"The Psychedelics\" It's pretty clear that the latin names of this plant are somewhat confused (which is typical). Ipomoea purpurea, Ipomoea tricolor, Ipomoea violacea and Ipomoea rubro-caerulea are all the same plant. The other variety of morning glory, \"Ololiuhqui\" has at least two Latin names as well: Turbina corymbosa, and Rivea corymbosa. \"Recreational use of Ergoline Alkaloids from Argyreia Nervosa\" William E. Shawcross Journal of Psychedelic Drugs Vol. 15(4) Oct-Dec 1983\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the chemical composition and botanical variety of morning glory seeds used for their psychedelic alkaloids, highlighting plant names, potential contaminants like fungicides, and the importance of sourcing seeds from unsprayed plants. It provides detail on plant identification confusion and references research on ergoline alkaloids in Argyreia nervosa, relevant to understanding the natural sources and safety considerations of plant-based psychedelics covered in the full document.\n                "}

On Day 9, participants received a saline infusion followed by an alcohol infusion and also viewed affective stimuli in a magnetic resonance scanner. Irrespective of medication treatment condition, the alcohol infusion did not activate the VS in the alcohol-dependent patients. Unexpectedly, VS activation was greater in NTX treated patients than in the PLC group. NTX treated patients also reported increased craving in response to alcohol cue exposure, and increased subjective response to alcohol (\"high\" and \"intoxicated\") compared to PLC subjects. No significant effects of alcohol infusion on brain response to affective stimuli were in the NTX or PLC groups. Unlike previous findings in social drinkers, a moderate level of intoxication did not activate the VS in treatment-seeking alcoholics. This is likely to reflect tolerance to the positively reinforcing properties of alcohol in this clinical population. Our findings may help explain the efficacy of NTX to reduce heavy drinking,\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes a study on the effects of naltrexone (NTX) versus placebo (PLC) on brain activation and subjective responses during alcohol infusion in treatment-seeking alcoholics, highlighting that alcohol did not activate the ventral striatum (VS) as in social drinkers. It reports greater VS activation and increased craving and intoxication ratings in NTX-treated patients, suggesting tolerance to alcohol's rewarding effects. This content is relevant for understanding naltrexone's neurobiological impact and clinical efficacy in reducing heavy drinking.\n                "}
