It can encourage physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation that amphetamine produces can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still. Jaw clenching, involuntary bodily shakes, and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general loss of fine motor control. This is replaced with mild fatigue and general exhaustion during the offset of the experience. Spontaneous bodily sensations - The \"body high\" of amphetamine can be described as a moderate euphoric tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. Physical euphoria Abnormal heartbeat [28] Increased heart rate\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the physical effects of amphetamine, including its energizing stimulation, involuntary movements like jaw clenching and tremors, and sensations of euphoria.
