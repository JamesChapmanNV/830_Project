Can it make it harder for me to get pregnant?\n\nIt is not known if zolpidem can make it harder to get pregnant.\n\n◈ Does taking zolpidem increase the chance for miscarriage?\n\nMiscarriage is common and can occur in any pregnancy for many different reasons. Studies have not been done to see if zolpidem increases the chance for miscarriage.\n\n◈ Does taking zolpidem increase the chance of birth defects?\n\nEvery pregnancy starts out with a 3-5% chance of having a birth defect. This is called the background risk. Several studies have found that using zolpidem during pregnancy does not increase the chance for birth defects beyond the background risk.\n\n◈ Does taking zolpidem increase the chance of other pregnancy related problems?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses pregnancy-related safety questions for zolpidem, summarizing the current evidence on its effects on fertility, miscarriage risk, birth defects, and pregnancy complications. It is part of the safety and hazards section, providing important information for healthcare professionals and patients concerned about reproductive health during zolpidem use, and helps facilitate targeted search for pregnancy safety data within the full document.\n                "}

Any substance or food can be over used to the point where it can cause physical damage or dysfunctional psychological dependence in at least some people. The primary negative health effects associated with ketamine are accidents that happen when people are under the influence (falls, burns, etc); life, work, and social problems related to frequent use; inability to control the dose and frequency of use ('compulsive use'); damage to nasal passages from frequent insufflation; possible injection-site infections from IM and IV use; and lasting urinary tract damage and pain.\n\nCompulsive Use:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses the potential negative health effects of ketamine use, highlighting risks such as accidents, dependence, nasal damage, infections, and urinary issues.

Never fear, 2aminopropane (or \"isopropylamine\") is water MISCIBLE. Yes, the BASE form is miscible w/ H2O! Amphetamine BASE is only \"slightly\" soluble in water, so if your really a purist you can dissolve your \"mostly amphetamine some 2aminopropane\" in ether and backwash with water maybe ONCE. Then precipitate the crystals with dry HCl or H2SO4?
