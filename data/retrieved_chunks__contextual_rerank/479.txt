This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nOxymorphone can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).\n\nOpioid overdoses can be treated by calling the local emergency number and administering an opioid antagonist such as naloxone.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the risks of overdose from oxymorphone, highlighting respiratory depression, danger of aspiration leading to suffocation, and the importance of harm reduction practices such as positioning and naloxone treatment, within the broader context of toxicity and safe usage of the drug.\n                "}
