It also has a notably longer duration (six to eight hours instead of three to five) and produces more traditional serotonergic psychedelic effects (such as visual distortions) along with appreciably higher activity on dopamine, which is also believed to be responsible for the greater degree of neurotoxicity it produces.[3]\n\nToday, possession of MDA is illegal in most countries, although some limited exceptions exist for scientific and medical research.\n\nContents\n\n1 History and culture\n\n2 Chemistry\n\n3 Pharmacology\n\n4 Subjective effects\n\n4.1 Physical effects\n\n4.2 Visual effects\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of MDA's emergence as a recreational drug in 1967, its pharmacological action as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and its longer-lasting, more psychedelic effects compared to MDMA, including increased neurotoxicity risk.

After several hearings, a US Federal Administrative Law Judge recommended that MDMA should be made a Schedule III controlled substance so that it could be used in the medical field. Despite this, the director of the DEA overruled this recommendation and classified MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance.[16][14]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section outlines the historical transition of MDMA from a legal, therapeutic tool introduced by Dr. Leo Zeff and clinicians in California during the 1970s-80s to its subsequent emergence as a popular recreational drug, leading to federal classification as a Schedule I controlled substance despite initial recommendations for medical use.\n                "}
