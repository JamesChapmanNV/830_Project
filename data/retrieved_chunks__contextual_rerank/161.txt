In response to concerns about the increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic substances by the general public, psychedelics like psilocybin began to receive negative press and faced increasingly restrictive laws.\n\nIn the United States, laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic substances. Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year.[18] Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the Schedule I category of illicit substances in 1970. Subsequent restrictions on the use of these substances in human research made funding for such projects difficult to obtain, and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being \"professionally marginalized\".[19]\n\nIn 1976 the book Psilocybin Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide was released, written by Terence McKenna.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the historical suppression of psilocybin research and advocacy, highlighting key figures like Leary and Alpert's influence, subsequent legal restrictions in the US including Schedule I classification, and notable publications such as McKenna's guide, illustrating the shift from cultural use to prohibition.
