Also, sharing snorting equipment (nasal spray bottles, straws, banknotes, bullets, etc) has been linked to the transmission of hepatitis C. (Bonkovsky and Mehta) In one study, the University of Tennessee Medical Center researches warned that other blood-borne diseases such as HIV, the AIDS-causing virus, could be transmitted as well.

Frequent administration is not safe either. Chronic cocaine use can lead to the development of nasal septum perforation , which may progress to a more severe condition known as cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions (CIMDL). Contaminated currency such as banknotes might serve as a fomite of diseases like hepatitis C [47] Short-term side effects of insufflation includes nasal congestion, which may last for 24 hours. Frequent insufflation of some substances can damage one's mucous membranes, induce bleeding, damage the nostril's cartilage and lining, burn the throat, and cause other trauma to the nasal passage and sinus area. [48] A nasal septum perforation is a medical condition in which the nasal septum, the bony/cartilaginous wall dividing the nasal cavities, develops a hole or fissure.
