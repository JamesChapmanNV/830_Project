It was marketed under the name Sernyl and began to be used in surgical procedures in 1963.[13]\n\nBy 1967, it was discontinued due to postoperative dysphoria and hallucinations. After 1967, it was limited to veterinary use. Also in the 1960s, PCP began to be illegally manufactured in laboratories and emerged as a popular street drug in San Francisco. In the 1970s, PCP use became widespread.[13]\n\nCommon names\n\nCommon street names for PCP are the peace pill, angel dust, sherm sticks, peeps, crystal joints, rocket fuel, sawgrass, zoom, the sheets, and elephant tranquilizer.[13]\n\nChemistry\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides historical background, common street names, and chemical information about PCP, complementing the main content by detailing its discovery, development as an anesthetic, illicit manufacturing, and usage history, as well as its street identifiers and chemical classification.\n                "}
