On the basis of chemical degradation and correlation with cannabinol, a general structure was proposed. In 1963, Raphael Mechoulam isolated CBD from Lebanese hashish and established its structure and relative stereochemistry.[7] Its absolute stereochemistry was determined in 1967.[7]\n\nAdulterated CBD-products\n\nAt least 128 samples out of more than 350 tested by government labs in nine states, nearly all in the South, had 371 types of synthetic cannabinoids in products marketed as CBD. Half of the 28 tested CBD-vape products contained less than 0.3% CBD.[8]\n\nChemistry\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides historical, cultural, and chemical background on cannabidiol (CBD), highlighting its first isolation in 1940, structural elucidation by Raphael Mechoulam in the 1960s, and issues with adulterated CBD products containing synthetic cannabinoids, relevant to understanding CBD's origins, chemistry, and quality concerns discussed in the broader document.\n                "}
