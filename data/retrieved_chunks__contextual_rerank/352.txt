It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the substance in contrast to a familiar environment.[24]\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nWarning: Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the increased risk of fatal overdose associated with opioid relapse due to decreased tolerance and environmental factors, highlighting the importance of cautious dosing after a break. It also emphasizes the dangers of combining fentanyl with other substances, listing hazardous interactions that can significantly increase health risks.
