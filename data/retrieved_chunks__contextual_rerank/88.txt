Problematic use is sometimes accompanied by paranoia, an increase in the sense of synchronicity in daily experiences, and egocentrism (the world revolves around the user). With compulsive use, a user may also have impaired judgment with respect to what activities or contexts are appropriate while under the influence (e.g. driving a car, going to a job, or taking a bath), which can increase the risk of accidents. As with any addictive substance, it's a good idea to set hard limits about maximum use and types of use before it becomes a problem.\n\nUrinary Tract Problems:6\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses potential health risks associated with ketamine use, specifically focusing on addictive behaviors and urinary tract problems.

One ketamine user recommends that people set a limit on use *before* ever trying it so they can have a benchmark against which to judge usage levels. Write down the limits. What do you think a reasonable maximum usage would be: once per month? once per week? twice per day? Check in regularly with pre-K usage limits and (if possible) have someone who can be confided in about use and who can act as an external sanity check. While not common, it is not unusual for people to fall into patterns of use much higher than they expected. John Lilly is a classic example of a person who ended up using A LOT of ketamine, but there are many others. Using once per day or more may also cause long-term problems. We have received at least one report of a person who used ketamine once to twice per day for six months, and a year and a half later felt that he had done permanent damage to himself, experiencing persistent flashes and streaks in his vision. Mostly the dangers are\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses concerns about ketamine habituation and long-term health effects, emphasizing the importance of setting usage limits and monitoring patterns to prevent dependence and damage.
