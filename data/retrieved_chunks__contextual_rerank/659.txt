[24] The possession of controlled substances without a prescription is a criminal offense. [25] However, certain preparations of codeine are exempt from this restriction under Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. It is thus legal to possess codeine without a prescription, provided that it is compounded with at least one other active or inactive ingredient and that the dosage of each tablet, capsule, etc does not exceed 100 mg or 2.5% concentration in the case of liquid preparations.

It was found in combination with free morphine and 6-acetylmorphine, codeine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine in postmortem cases at the Puerto Rico Institute of Forensic Sciences (PRIFS). Xylazine is not approved for human use because it has been proven harmful. Currently, three separate analyses are required to determine all the aforementioned drugs at the PRIFS's toxicology laboratory. To reduce analysis time consumption, sample volume, run time, sample preparation and cost, a high-throughput ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of xylazine, free morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, codeine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine in 0.25 mL postmortem blood by protein precipitation, fulfilling confirmation criteria with three transitions for each compound with acceptable relative ion intensities.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the detection of xylazine as an adulterant in heroin in Puerto Rico, highlighting its co-occurrence with other opioids and cocaine in postmortem toxicology cases.

Prior to Jan 1, 2006, Ketamine was not controlled in the U.K. under the Misuse of Drugs Act, making it legal to possess. However sales and distribution were controlled under the Medicines Act making it illegal to sell or distribute without a license.
