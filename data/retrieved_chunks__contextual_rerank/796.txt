There is concern that analgesic substitutes, such as codeine, will not be as safe or effective. The purpose of this study is to compare the demographics, adverse events, and medical outcomes of patients who had unintentional hydrocodone or codeine exposures through the use of a state's poison center database. The Texas Poison Center Network's database was utilized to find all reported unintentional ingestions or adverse reactions of products containing codeine or hydrocodone. Comparisons were made between the two medications by calculating the rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Children aged 5 years or younger were more exposed to codeine (51.6%). Hydrocodone exposures had more serious outcomes (11% vs. 9%; RR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.73-0.91) and had more nausea\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses adverse effects and safety considerations related to opioids, specifically comparing unintentional exposures to hydrocodone and codeine based on poison center data, highlighting differences in outcomes, age groups affected, and associated symptoms such as nausea. It is relevant to the document's comprehensive review of chemical safety, toxicity, and medical research on opioids like codeine. The data emphasizes patterns in accidental exposures and health risks, supporting the broader context of opioid safety assessment.\n                "}

Codeine is a widely used opioid, which is metabolized to morphine to elicit analgesia. Prolonged morphine exposure exacerbates pain by activating the innate immune toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the central nervous system. In silico docking simulations indicate codeine also docks to MD2, an accessory protein for TLR4, suggesting potential to induce TLR4-dependent pain facilitation. We hypothesized codeine would cause TLR4-dependent hyperalgesia/allodynia that is disparate from its opioid receptor-dependent analgesic rank potency. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were assessed using hotplate and von Frey tests at days 0, 3 and 5 in mice receiving intraperitoneal equimolar codeine (21 mg kg(-1)), morphine (20 mg kg(-1)) or saline, twice daily. This experiment was repeated in animals with prior partial nerve injury and in TLR4 null mutant mice. Interventions with interleukin-1 receptor\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details recent research on the neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying opioid-induced hyperalgesia, highlighting codeine's potential to activate TLR4 and exacerbate pain sensitivity independently of its analgesic effects. It is relevant within the broader pharmacology and toxicity discussion, illustrating molecular pathways and behavioral effects associated with chronic opioid use. Key details include mouse models, dosing regimens, and intervention strategies targeting TLR4-mediated pain facilitation.\n                "}
