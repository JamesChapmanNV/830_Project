This occurs due to the way in which opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's euphoric, analgesic (pain relief), and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects.\n\nOxymorphone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic related to hydromorphone. It affects the central nervous system and smooth muscles by activation of specific opiate receptors. Hydromorphone and oxymorphone are semisynthetic derivatives of morphine and potent opiate agonists which are used predominantly to treat moderate-to-severe pain.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt explains the pharmacological mechanism of oxymorphone, detailing how it activates μ-opioid receptors to produce analgesic and euphoria effects. It emphasizes its structural relation to other opioids like hydromorphone and morphine and highlights its central nervous system impact, making it crucial for understanding the drug’s potency, effects, and risks described throughout the full webpage.\n                "}

It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[7]\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nOxymorphone is dangerous to use in combination with other depressants as many fatalities reported as overdoses are caused by interactions with other depressant drugs like alcohol or benzodiazepines, resulting in dangerously high levels of respiratory depression.[8]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the increased overdose risk associated with opioid cessation and relapse due to reduced tolerance, highlighting environmental influences on overdose danger. It also covers the heightened risks of dangerous interactions between oxymorphone and other depressants like alcohol and benzodiazepines, emphasizing the importance of harm reduction. This information is crucial for understanding the factors that elevate overdose and interaction hazards in opioid use.\n                "}
