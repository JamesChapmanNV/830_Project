At this dosage range the adverse effects tend to be minimal, and the pleasurable effects quite noticeable. [I have never noticed any euphoria below 100 mg, so don't give up just because two 3s don't give you a high. *However, some unfortunate individuals are allergic to codeine, and, if you have never used it before, first try a dose of around 30-60 mg and see what will happen. It is dangerous to start off in the high dose range.*] It is usually a good idea to take the drug on an empty stomach, and if nausea is experienced or you get hungry (not likely) you can have something to eat. On an empty stomach the effects will become noticeable within 15 min depending on the dose. With higher doses the effects can begin in as little as 7 min.
