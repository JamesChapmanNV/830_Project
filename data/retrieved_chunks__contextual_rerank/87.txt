Intravenous fentanyl was given to 50 women as a single dose of 50 mcg after delivery. Both groups received epidural or spinal bupivacaine in addition. A slight difference was seen in breastfeeding behavior between the groups, with the infants in the intravenous fentanyl group performing slightly worse than those in the epidural group.

However, chronic hepatitis B and C are common among persons on methadone maintenance. There is no evidence that methadone maintenance worsens the course of chronic viral hepatitis. In prospective studies, transient serum enzyme elevations were not uncommon in patients on methadone maintenance; however, almost all of the abnormalities occurred in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis B or C and no clinically apparent liver injury arose anew during therapy.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides information on methadone's water environmental safety assessment through USGS health-based screening levels, emphasizing its classification as a pharmaceutical and referencing a 2024 study. It also discusses methadone's hepatotoxicity, noting the lack of significant liver injury risk but highlighting common viral hepatitis among users. These details are relevant for understanding water safety and hepatic safety profiles within the comprehensive chemical profile.\n                "}
