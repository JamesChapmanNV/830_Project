Pregabalin oral bioavailability is estimated to be greater than or equal to 90%. The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food, resulting in delay of approximately 3 hours to reach peak plasma concentrations, with peak levels themselves, decreased by about 25 to 30%.[13] Administration with food, however, has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption.[14]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt explains the pharmacological basis of pregabalin's calming effects by linking its action on brain overexcitability-related conditions to its absorption and bioavailability. It details key pharmacokinetic properties, including rapid absorption on an empty stomach, high oral bioavailability, and how food intake delays absorption but does not significantly affect overall uptake, which is essential for understanding its onset and dosing considerations.\n                "}

Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air; avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrin e) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.\n\nFill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible.
