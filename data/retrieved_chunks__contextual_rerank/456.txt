Harman and James Fadiman >From \"Altered States of Consciousness, A Book of Readings\" edited by Charles Tart BF311.T28 Of the naturally occurring plant alkaloids used in ancient and modern religious rites and divination one of the least studied is ololiuqui. The earliest known description of its use is by Hernandez, the King of Spain's personal physician, who spent a number of years in Mexico studying the medicinal plants of the Indians and \"accurately illustrated ololiuqui as a morning glory in his work which was not published until 1651\" (Schultes, 1960). In his words, \"When a person takes ololiuqui, in a short time he loses clear reasoning because of the strength of the seed, and he believes he is in communion with the devil\" (Alacon, 1945). Schultes (1941) and Wasson (1961) have reported in detail on the religious and divinatory use of two kinds of morning-glory seeds, Rivea corymbosa and Ipomoea\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses Ipomoea purpurea, a naturally occurring psychedelic plant related to morning glory seeds, highlighting its traditional use in religious and divinatory practices. It cites historical descriptions of ololiuqui's effects, including loss of reasoning and perceived communication with the divine or the devil. The content is relevant as it provides botanical, ethnopharmacological, and psychoactive information about a key plant in psychedelic history and culture within the broader context of plant-based psychoactives.\n                "}

It is identical with the species of morning glory described above. The seeds must be chewed or ground in order to be effective. Soaking the ground seeds in water for several hours, filtering out the grounds, and then drinking only the water portion of the mixture can reduce some of the stomach-upset symptoms if such occur. Unpleasant LSD and morning glory trips can be smoothed out or even stopped by taking niacin (in the form of nicotinic acid, vitamin B-3 or \"niacin\"). Vitamin C has been shown to reduce the incidence of paranoia and prevent depletion of the vitamin from the adrenal glands during LSD trips. There have been reports that commercially available packets of morning glory seeds from some distributors are coated with fungicides or other chemicals to increase shelf life or discourage the practice of eating\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on Ipomoea purpurea seeds, sold as \"Heavenly Blue,\" including preparation, effects, and remedies for LSD-like trips and stomach upset, highlighting their psychoactive potential and practical considerations within the broader discussion of plant hallucinogens and their properties.\n                "}
