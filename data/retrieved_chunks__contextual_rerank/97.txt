Place the cottons that were inside in a jar and close the lid. (Remember you use all 12 cottons.)\n\nIn the bowl, combine 1- 1/3 oz. water and 2/3 oz. muriatic acid. Shred cottons in this solution, and knead for 5 minutes with hands. (ALWAYS BE SURE THERE'S CLEAN RUBBER GLOVES on your hands.) You can do it bare-handed if you' got tough skin. Squeeze all juice out of filters after you knead, and throw em away.\n\nFilter the remaining liquid into the quart jar. It will be necessary to this several times to get that awful smelling oil out. The chemicals in the inhalers have been bonded to the HCl, and the oils have been filtered off. Throw the filters away.\n\nPour enough of the solution into a small bottle to fill it 1/3 full. Save any leftover juice for the second batch.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt describes an alleged homemade synthesis method for extracting methamphetamine from Vicks nasal inhalers, detailing steps such as opening inhalers, kneading cottons in water and muriatic acid, filtering oils, and preparing solution portions.
