From: dmurphy3@aol.com (DMurphy3) This may be so (in fact I read the same article), but typically a water quench leads to the alcohol, which is what we were trying to get rid of to start with. Also, if one were using Na rather than Li (Na is the Birch, I too forget the Li named reduction), adding water to quench will *definitely* be exciting, particularly considering the flammability of THF or ether. Apparently they were following the guys handwritten notes. It would have been even more interesting had they used the real Birch method, using Na, especially when they tried the water quench ;>) From: eleusis@netcom.com (Eleusis) Yep - apparently that would be the case. As well, any extra Li (or Na if doing the straight Birch method) would convert to the Hydroxide, which might fuck the product up a bit. I bet you they *did* do that the first time, and then, after they replaced that wing of the lab, they decided not to \"publish\" those results ;-).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the technical considerations and potential issues encountered during a Birch reduction synthesis of methamphetamine, specifically highlighting the effects of water quenching with sodium or lithium metal. It emphasizes the risks of side reactions, such as forming alcohols, and suggests that original handwritten notes may have led to suboptimal procedures, providing insights relevant for understanding clandestine synthesis methods within the broader chemistry and synthesis sections of the document.\n                "}

During this study, atropine was used as a bolus for a heart rate less than 60 beats/min. The other apparent advantage to this regimen was a decreased number of respiratory infections. This may represent an alternative when there is a concern for respiratory infection due to excessive and difficult to control secretions, and in the presence of altered level of consciousness where the distinction between atropine toxicity or relapse of organophosphate poisoning is unclear. /Organophosphate pesticides/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses alternative medical treatments for organophosphate poisoning, focusing on glycopyrolate as a safer substitute for atropine, including its administration and advantages.
