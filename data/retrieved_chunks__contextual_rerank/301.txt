It emerged as a recreational substance in mid-1967, under the name \"The Peace Pill\".[9][10] Since this time, a number of synthetic derivatives of PCP (e.g. 3-MeO-PCP, 4-MeO-PCP, MXE) have been sold as dissociative drugs for both recreational and non-medical use.[11]\n\nSubjective effects include motor control loss, pain relief, internal hallucinations, memory suppression, conceptual thinking, euphoria, and depersonalization / dissociation. Routes of administration include oral, smoking, insufflation or injection.[12] The effects are among the most potent and long-lasting in the class.
