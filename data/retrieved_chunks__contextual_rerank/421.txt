Perhaps the most commonly reported benefits from LSD are changed perspective and substantive insights into one's life.16\n\nTreatment of Cluster Headaches. User reports by people with a severe form of migraine-like headaches called cluster headaches include descriptions of nearly complete blocking of the painful experiences with the use of LSD, psilocybin, and related compounds. Research into this issue is ongoing.8, 17\n\nUse in Psychotherapy.9\n\nUse in Addiction Treatment. LSD and other psychedelics have been investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic treatment of addiction and alcoholism. Such research stalled in the late 1960s, when prohibition made studies with LSD much more difficult to conduct, and addiction treatment remains an unproven-yet-potential health benefit from LSD.18,21\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section highlights the potential mental health benefits of LSD, including insights into self and the world, and its emerging therapeutic uses such as treatment for cluster headaches, psychotherapy, and addiction.
