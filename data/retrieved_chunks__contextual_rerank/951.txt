Or the dropoff might be caused by lasting neurophysiological or neurological \"changes\" to the brain from exposure to MDMA, the prior state of the changed structures being necessary for ecstatic MDMA experiences. It is an as-yet-unanswered question whether such changes, if they happen, are best regarded as harmful, neutral, or beneficial. If you choose to use MDMA, the lesson here may be to spend your first few sessions wisely and cherish them. Later sessions may never seem as ecstatic.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the phenomenon of diminishing effects (\"dropoff\") experienced by some MDMA users after repeated sessions, contrasting it with sustained effects of other psychedelics like LSD and DMT. It explores possible neurophysiological causes and emphasizes the importance of valuing initial experiences, highlighting considerations for safe and mindful use within the broader context of MDMA safety, effects, and pharmacology discussed in the webpage.\n                "}
