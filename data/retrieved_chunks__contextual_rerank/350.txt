Bethesda, MD. 2017, p. 2248\n\nThere have been two new alerts issued related to synthetic opioids. The Gulf Coast High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area has issued an alert for a substance with the street name \"Grey Death.\" The substance appears similar to concrete mixing powder and varies in texture, which ranges from a chunky rock-like material to a fine powder. It is not a single drug, but typically contains several potent opioids, including whatever a drug dealer has on hand in varying proportions. It has a potency much higher than heroin and is reportedly administered via injection, ingestion, insufflation, and smoking. The analysis of each grey death sample collected in the gulf coast region so far revealed the presence of three opioids: U-47700, heroin, and fentanyl; though the amount of each drug within grey death varied from sample to sample.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This segment provides specific drug product information for Abstral, a fentanyl formulation, cited in the 2017 drug reference. It also highlights recent alerts about synthetic opioids, particularly the \"Grey Death\" mixture containing fentanyl, heroin, and U-47700, emphasizing the ongoing illicit drug risks associated with fentanyl-related substances. The details are relevant for drug classification and current public health alerts within the broader comprehensive chemical data document.\n                "}

Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course because of the nature of absorption. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous. It is also potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk from the “Toxicity and harm potential” section highlights the dangers of non-medical fentanyl use, emphasizing the high risk of overdose and the challenges in dosing safely due to its extreme potency. It also notes the dangers of mixing fentanyl with depressants and the difficulty in diluting pure powder, underscoring its lethal potential and relevance to harm reduction information within the broader fentanyl overview.\n                "}
