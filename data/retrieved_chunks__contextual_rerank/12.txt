The multiplicity of symptoms and syndromes described in the \"adverse reaction\" literature should make it clear that LSD can cause a number of reactions that can last for any amount of time--from minutes to, possibly, years. I believe what is being studied here is the question of the potential role of LSD in accelerating or precipitating the onset of an illness that was \"programmed\" to develop ultimately in a particular individual--in a manner comparable to the major physical or emotional stress that often precipitates a bona fide myocardial infarction in an individual with advanced coronary atheresclerosis. The stress did not _cause_ the heart disease; it was only the stimulus that accelerated the inexorable process to manifest illness. In looking at the relevant studies, Breakey et al. found that schizophrenics who \"used drugs\" had an earlier onset of symptoms and hospitalization than\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the potential role of LSD in triggering or accelerating schizophrenia-like disorders, emphasizing that adverse reactions can last from Minutes to years. It frames such reactions as stressors that may amplify pre-existing conditions rather than direct causes, referencing studies like Breakey et al. to illustrate earlier onset of symptoms in drug-using schizophrenics. This section is relevant for understanding LSD's potential psychiatric risks within the comprehensive discussion of drug effects and adverse reactions.\n                "}
