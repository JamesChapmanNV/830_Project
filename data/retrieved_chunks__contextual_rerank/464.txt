There have been reports of severe cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in patients (including children) treated with stimulants. These reports led to the temporary suspension of marketing for extended-release MAS in Canada in 2005 and proposals for an FDA boxed warning in the United States. Some reported cases involved patients with underlying structural cardiovascular abnormalities and/or patients who took supratherapeutic doses of the medication. Several large follow-up studies have failed to demonstrate an increased risk of severe cardiovascular events in patients treated with stimulant medications.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes the contentious link between amphetamine use and severe cardiovascular risks, referencing reports of myocardial infarction and sudden death in treated patients, which prompted regulatory actions like the 2005 Canadian suspension and FDA warning proposals. It highlights that some cases involved underlying heart conditions or high doses, but large studies have not confirmed an increased cardiovascular risk, making this a key point in discussions of amphetamine safety and toxicity in the full document.\n                "}
