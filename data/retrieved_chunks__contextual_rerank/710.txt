However, it has a rapid onset and short duration of action relative to other opioids, which can lead to compulsive redosing. Additionally, many users report noticeably less euphoria with fentanyl and its analogs. As a result, it is generally considered to have lower recreational value.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the various pharmaceutical and street forms of fentanyl, highlighting its prevalence and associated overdose risks in the US. It also summarizes fentanyl's subjective effects, comparing its rapid onset, short duration, and relatively lower recreational euphoria to other opioids, which is essential for understanding its dangers and user experience.\n                "}

Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course because of the nature of absorption. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous. It is also potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk from the “Toxicity and harm potential” section highlights the dangers of non-medical fentanyl use, emphasizing the high risk of overdose and the challenges in dosing safely due to its extreme potency. It also notes the dangers of mixing fentanyl with depressants and the difficulty in diluting pure powder, underscoring its lethal potential and relevance to harm reduction information within the broader fentanyl overview.\n                "}
