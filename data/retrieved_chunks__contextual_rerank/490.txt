Two juvenile females were discovered unresponsive and hypoxic by a male acquaintance. The trio had reportedly crushed and snorted Opana ER tablets and consumed Xanax for recreational purposes. Emergency personnel were able to stabilize one female. The second female was pronounced dead at the scene. Blood and urine samples from the surviving female were collected at the trauma center between 48 and 96 hr post incident. Toxicology results showed the presence of oxymorphone, doxylamine, dextromethorphan, alprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, oxazepam, and temazepam in her urine. No drugs were detected in her blood. Toxicology on the deceased female revealed the presence of 0.13 mg/L oxymorphone and 0.04 mg/L alprazolam in her blood. Gastric contents contained 0.25 and 0.93 mg/L of oxymorphone and alprazolam, respectively.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section summarizes case reports of illicit abuse and overdose involving extended-release oxymorphone (Opana ER), often combined with other substances like alprazolam, highlighting toxicology findings and fatal outcomes.
