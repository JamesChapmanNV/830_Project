Twelve healthy volunteers received intravenously administered LSD (75 ug) and, on a separate occasion, placebo, before being scanned under eyes-closed resting conditions with and without music-listening. The parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has previously been linked with (1) music-evoked emotion, (2) the action of psychedelics, and (3) mental imagery. Imaging analyses therefore focused on changes in the connectivity profile of this particular structure. Results revealed increased PHC-visual cortex (VC) functional connectivity and PHC to VC information flow in the interaction between music and LSD. This latter result correlated positively with ratings of enhanced eyes-closed visual imagery, including imagery of an autobiographical nature. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which LSD works in combination with music listening to enhance certain subjective experiences that may be useful in a therapeutic context.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section describes a functional MRI study investigating LSD's effects on brain connectivity. It highlights increased parahippocampal cortex to visual cortex connectivity during music listening under LSD, correlating with enhanced visual imagery, and discusses potential therapeutic mechanisms, relevant to understanding LSD's neural action and subjective effects detailed in the full document.\n                "}
