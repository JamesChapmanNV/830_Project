Dock was staring at the scoreboard when he realized he'd pitched hitless ball for seven innings. He smacked Cash on the arm. \"Hey, look,\" said Dock, pointing at the scoreboard. \"I've got a no-no going!\" Cash gave him a blank look. \"A no-no?\" asked Cash. He'd never heard the term before.

The Pirates won the game, 2-0, despite Ellis walking eight batters. Dock had a pretty good year in 1970.
