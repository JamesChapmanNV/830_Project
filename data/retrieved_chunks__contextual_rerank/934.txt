How long does the medication stay in my body?\n\nPeople eliminate medication at different rates. In healthy adults, it takes up to 9 days, on average, for most of the buprenorphine to be gone from the body. It may take more time for long-acting (extended-release) medications.\n\n◈ I take buprenorphine.

It is not known if buprenorphine increases the chance of miscarriage. Limited studies looking at buprenorphine use in pregnancy have not found higher rates of miscarriage than what is seen in the general population.\n\n◈ Does taking buprenorphine increase the chance of birth defects?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This content addresses common questions regarding buprenorphine use before and during pregnancy, including drug elimination, potential effects on fertility, miscarriage risk, and birth defects.
