Edgewood Arsenal provided MDA to Dr. Cattell as part of a research program exploring the possible use of MDA as one of several interrogation tools. Cattell later reported We didn't know whether it was dog piss or what it was we were giving him. Blauer's wife won $18,000 in damages in a legal suit against the state in 1955, but the army successfully hid its involvement.  In 1987, Blauer's daughters win a law suit against the federal government for $700,000 over it's role in their father's death. After Blauer's death, Edgewood terminated its investigation into MDA.

These symptoms are characteristic of serotonin syndrome which is often described as mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities. At 10 hours post-ingestion the patient was found unconscious. He had aspirated stomach contents into his lungs. His respiration, blood pressure, and pulse were all severely depressed. He never regained conciousness, and he died 5 days later. The medical examiner's finding was probable acute methadone intoxication. In this case serotonin syndrome appears to have opposed and delayed typical /CNS depression/ symptoms. Methadone has additional pharmacologic and toxicologic properties which may complicate the assessment and treatment in overdose situations.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a fatal overdose case involving methadone, highlighting symptoms of serotonin syndrome, delayed CNS depression, and respiratory failure.
