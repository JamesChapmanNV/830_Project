And don't forget: you will eventually come down.\" Sober sitters or psychotherapeutic guides are often suggested as a means of substantially reducing the risk related to adverse mental and physical events that may be associated with LSD use. Individuals have also been encouraged to prepare themselves psychologically for the experience, by being ready to accept whatever emerges out of their psyche (\"I love this, too... even the snarling spider about to eat me who looks like my mother.\").

I would much rather face the danger of exploding champagne bottles. Those who insist on finding out for themselves, will see Journal of the American Chemical Society, volume 68, page 2305. As I recall, the Poor Man's James Bond also has a formula for making red phosphorus. Those with a knack for scrounging from industrial sources will profit from knowing that red phosphorus is used in large quantities in the fireworks and matchmaking industries. The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 40% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses methods for sourcing and preparing red phosphorus, a key reagent used in clandestine methamphetamine synthesis.
