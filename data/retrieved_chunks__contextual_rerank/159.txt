The Procedure 1. Obtain a quantity of tablets containing codeine, check to see if they contain anything other than codeine, caffeine, acetaminophen or aspirin. If they do, and you don't know whether or not it will be a problem, your best bet is not to use them. Measure out your desired amount of codeine (ex. 64 mg = 8 tablets * 8 mg/tablet). You may want to add 2 extra tablets as it is quite likely you will lose some codeine in the procedure. As you get more experience with the procedure you will be able to get approx. 95% of the codeine extracted. 2. Measure out some nice hot water, use approx. 40 ml / 20 tablets or more if needed. I would suggest you don't go over 50 ml for 20 tablets. I don't know if the use of boiling water would destroy any of the codeine but your best bet is not to use it. Use hot water but not boiling. Make sure the tablets dissolve completely.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a step-by-step procedure for extracting codeine from OTC tablets, emphasizing measuring a desired dose, using hot water (not boiling), and filtering the solution.

[I have found that it is better to use products containing asprin, as opposed to tylenol, because the filtering process goes more smoothly and, if one is not allergic to salicilates, aspirin is safer (easier on the liver, etc). Given its solubility, you will also end up with far less aspirin than acetominophen per volume of the product.] The idea behind the following extraction is that acetaminophen and aspirin (I'll use A/A from now on) are very _insoluble_ in cold water. Codeine phosphate (the most common salt of codeine) is very _soluble_ in water including cold water.
