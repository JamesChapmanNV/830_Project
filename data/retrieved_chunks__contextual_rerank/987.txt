However, during initiation or dosage adjustments, patients should be counseled by their prescribing clinician about the drug's ability to affect their cognitive state, especially if that patient intends to drive or operate heavy machinery while on the medication until tolerance develops to this adverse effect. When prescribed codeine, patients should also receive counsel regarding the risk associated with exposure to other mind-altering substances. The concomitant use of codeine with other known sedatives, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, can significantly increase the risk of adverse and possibly dangerous effects. Naloxone availability can help as a specific antidote to reverse significant opioid overdose or CNS depression, even when these are secondary to concomitant use with other CNS depressing agents.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the potential central nervous system adverse effects of codeine, such as sedation and clouded mentation, highlighting the importance of patient counseling on tolerance development, driving risks, and interactions with sedatives or alcohol. It emphasizes safety precautions, overdose management with naloxone, and situates within the broader context of drug safety, toxicity, and clinical guidelines covered in the full chemical and pharmacological profile.\n                "}
