Problematic use is sometimes accompanied by paranoia, an increase in the sense of synchronicity in daily experiences, and egocentrism (the world revolves around the user). With compulsive use, a user may also have impaired judgment with respect to what activities or contexts are appropriate while under the influence (e.g. driving a car, going to a job, or taking a bath), which can increase the risk of accidents. As with any addictive substance, it's a good idea to set hard limits about maximum use and types of use before it becomes a problem.\n\nUrinary Tract Problems:6\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses potential health risks associated with ketamine use, specifically focusing on addictive behaviors and urinary tract problems. It provides guidance on recognizing problematic patterns and emphasizes the importance of moderation, making it relevant to those seeking comprehensive safety information within the broader context of ketamine dosage, effects, and precautions.\n                "}

In comparison to other hallucinogens, DPH has been reported to have significantly less abuse potential than other hallucinogens. This is simply because the vast majority of people who try it do not wish to repeat the experience.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of DPH develops with repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 1 - 2 weeks for tolerance to return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DPH presents cross-tolerance with all deliriants, meaning that after the consumption of DPH, all deliriants will have a reduced effect.\n\nDangerous interactions\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the dependence, tolerance, and interaction risks associated with diphenhydramine use, highlighting its potential for dependency with chronic use, cross-tolerance with other deliriants, and dangerous interactions with various substances. It is crucial for understanding the substance's abuse liability and safety considerations.\n                "}

The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).
