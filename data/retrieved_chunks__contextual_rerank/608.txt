Save the top layer, and throw the rest away.\n\nFill a bottle half-way with water, and about 10 drops of acid. Pour the top layer from step (8) into the bottle, and cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl/water mixture.\n\nIf there is anything left from step (3), repeat the procedure with it.\n\nEvaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this o the stove, but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be Methamphetamine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt describes the final steps in the chemical synthesis process of methamphetamine, specifically how to separate the free base, bond it with HCl to form a water-soluble salt, and then evaporate the solution to obtain crystalline methamphetamine.
