Other names for MDMA include Molly, ecstasy, E, X, XTC, and Mandy. MDMA can be taken by mouth as a pill or capsule or snorted / inhaled as a powder.If you have been using MDMA, please seek help right away. Treatment is available to help you stop using MDMA. Talk with your healthcare providers; they are there to help you.\n\n◈ I am taking MDMA, but I would like to stop taking it before getting pregnant. How long does the drug stay in my body?\n\nPeople eliminate drugs at different rates. In healthy adults, it takes up to 4 days, on average, for most of the MDMA to be gone from the body.\n\n◈ I take MDMA. Can it make it harder for me to get pregnant?\n\nIt is not known if MDMA can make it harder to get pregnant.\n\n◈ Does taking MDMA increase the chance for miscarriage?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides information on MDMA's effects during pregnancy and lactation, including its potential impact on conception, pregnancy outcomes, and drug elimination timeframes. It addresses common questions about MDMA use and reproductive health, making it relevant for clinicians, researchers, and users seeking safety and risk assessments related to pregnancy.\n                "}
