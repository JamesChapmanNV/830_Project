However, higher doses increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions such as anxiety, paranoia, panic attacks, delusions, psychosis, and, in rare cases, seizures.\n\nMedical attention is usually not needed except in the case of severe psychotic episodes or the suspected ingestion of so-called \"fake acid\", substances that mimics LSD's effects but carry the risk of physical toxicity and overdose (e.g. 25x-NBOMe or DOx).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses LSD's tolerance and overdose potential, highlighting that LSD has no known toxic dose and is effectively non-lethal, but higher doses can lead to psychological adverse effects like paranoia and psychosis.
