At this dosage range the adverse effects tend to be minimal, and the pleasurable effects quite noticeable. [I have never noticed any euphoria below 100 mg, so don't give up just because two 3s don't give you a high. *However, some unfortunate individuals are allergic to codeine, and, if you have never used it before, first try a dose of around 30-60 mg and see what will happen. It is dangerous to start off in the high dose range.*] It is usually a good idea to take the drug on an empty stomach, and if nausea is experienced or you get hungry (not likely) you can have something to eat. On an empty stomach the effects will become noticeable within 15 min depending on the dose. With higher doses the effects can begin in as little as 7 min. The effects peak at\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides dosage guidance and safety precautions for first-time or low-tolerance users of codeine, emphasizing starting doses of 30-60 mg and the risks of overdose.

This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nMorphine can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.\n\nDependence and abuse potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the serious risks of overdose with morphine, including respiratory depression and death, and highlights the importance of harm reduction practices such as preventing aspiration by lying in the recovery position.

It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[34]\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nMorphine is dangerous to use in combination with other depressants as many fatalities reported as overdoses are caused by interactions with other depressant drugs like alcohol or benzodiazepines, resulting in dangerously high levels of respiratory depression.[35]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the dangers of opioid overdose, emphasizing how reduced tolerance after cessation increases overdose risk and how environmental factors influence this risk.
