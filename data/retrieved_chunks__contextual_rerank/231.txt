The main difference between psilocybin and psilocin is their relative stabilities...psilocin is much more easily oxidized, so deteriorates much more quickly than psilocybin. The following chart shows approximate oral dosages of psilocybin in mg.\n\nOral Psilocybin Dosages Threshold 3 - 4 mg Light 4 - 8 mg Common 6 - 20 mg Strong 20 - 40 mg Heavy 35 + mg Onset : 15 - 20 minutes (when held in mouth) Onset : 30 - 60 minutes (when taken orally in capsule) Peak : 90 - 180 minutes Duration : 2 - 6 hours Normal After Effects : up to 8 hours\n\nNotes:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides dosage information and product details related to psilocybin mushrooms, including a product promotion for an Erowid hoodie.
