This makes it illegal to possess without a prescription. [More Info] Oct 27, 1970 The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act is passed.  Part II of this is the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) which defines a scheduling system for drugs.  It places most of the known hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin, psilocin, mescaline, peyote, cannabis, & MDA) in Schedule I.  It places coca, cocaine and injectable methamphetamine in Schedule II.  Other amphetamines and stimulants, including non-injectable methamphetamine are placed in Schedule III.

It highlights key regulatory milestones, such as the prohibition of certain formulations in 1966, the passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act in 1970, and the drug scheduling system that groups substances like LSD, psilocybin, cannabis, cocaine, and methamphetamine.
