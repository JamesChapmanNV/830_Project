I am not sure what the cause of this is, but its most likely some form of oil, either formed in the reaction or left over from a very poor solvent. It may or may not be harmless depending upon what it is. This oil is often removed with acetone, but ethyl-ether would be better suited for this as it dries faster. Pure methamphetamine HCl melts at around 170c (338f ). The crystals can be carefully chopped and mixed with sodium carbonate, and when the resulting powder is heated (and the methamphetamine HCl melts) CO2 and methamphetamine base vapor is given off. This is probably one of the more effective ways of smoking meth if you are careful, however the hydrochloride salt is often the form smoked as the base form is often an oil and is difficult to store, transport, and work with. Smoking the HCl form is OK if you don't mind a small quantity of pyrolysed drug. d-methamphetamine is, by nature,\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the physical appearance and handling of methamphetamine, noting waxy, wet-looking \"speed\" caused by residual oils from synthesis or poor solvents. It explains methods for removing impurities with acetone or ether, describes melting points of pure HCl salts, and details how vaporization of melted crystals with sodium carbonate produces vapor for smoking, highlighting differences between free base and salt forms for storage and use.\n                "}
