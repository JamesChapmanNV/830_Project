Secondly: 50 times more CBD than THC is needed to reduce acute effects of THC,[26] which makes it practically impossible to administer proper dosage by inhalation.

Moreover, psychological and psychomotor functions are not adversely affected. Chronic use and high doses of up to 1500 mg per day have been repeatedly shown to be well tolerated by humans. As a result, it is considered to have a good safety profile.[28] However, this information should be interpreted cautiously as cannabidiol has been subject to relatively few human studies; further research is needed to fully establish its safety profile.\n\nCommonly reported side effects from prescribed cannabidiol use include tiredness, diarrhea, and changes of appetite and weight.[29]\n\nDependence and abuse potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the toxicity, safety profile, and potential side effects of cannabidiol, highlighting its general tolerance, low toxicity, and minimal adverse effects based on clinical studies.
