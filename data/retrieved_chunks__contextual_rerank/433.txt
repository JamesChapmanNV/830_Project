Most users consider this to be a waste of their tripping experience, especially as it can make them sick to their stomachs. While fatalities caused by the direct pharmacological effects of ketamine are nearly unheard of at normal recreational doses, ketamine is a powerful anaesthetic and being anaesthetized, semi-conscious, or unconscious carries distinct risks. Body positions that restrict breathing or blood-flow (e.g. \"child's pose\" or face down into a pillow) can result in serious injury or death even if the person is conscious. Extreme care should be taken before combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, opiates, barbiturates, and/or benzodiazepines. This can be very dangerous. While most (if not all) of these combinations have been used without negative incident, this does NOT mean that they should be considered safe. Opiates/opioids such as heroin are\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the ketamine FAQ discusses the risks and dangers of overdose, highlighting that while fatalities from direct effects are rare, severe injury or death can occur if body positions restrict breathing or blood flow. It emphasizes extreme caution when combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, or opioids, and underscores the importance of understanding these risks within the broader context of safe recreational use and health concerns detailed in the full document.\n                "}
