It was followed in the next decade by the introduction of the first quick-acting prescription formulations of fentanyl for personal use, the Actiq lollipop and Fentora buccal through the delivery method of estradiol Mylan transdermal patches. As of 2012, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice[15] with several new delivery methods now available, including a sublingual spray for cancer patients.[16][17] In 2013, 1700 kilograms were used globally.[18]\n\nChemistry\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the historical development and medical formulations of fentanyl, highlighting its introduction for palliative care in the 1990s, subsequent rapid-acting prescription products, and its widespread clinical use by 2012, including various delivery methods and global consumption data.

Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course because of the nature of absorption. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous. It is also potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk from the “Toxicity and harm potential” section highlights the dangers of non-medical fentanyl use, emphasizing the high risk of overdose and the challenges in dosing safely due to its extreme potency. It also notes the dangers of mixing fentanyl with depressants and the difficulty in diluting pure powder, underscoring its lethal potential and relevance to harm reduction information within the broader fentanyl overview.\n                "}
