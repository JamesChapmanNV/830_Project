This should be used with extreme caution, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. This interaction can also amplify the anxiety, confusion and delusion producing aspects of cannabis significantly. Those who choose to use this combination are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose, and slow down the pace of their normal intake considerably.\n\nDissociatives - Dissociatives can enhance the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects of psilocybin mushrooms. Dissociative-induced holes, spaces, and voids while under the influence of psilocybin can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone, along with more intense internal hallucinations, confusion, nausea, delusions and increased risk of psychosis.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the combination effects of psilocybin mushrooms with other substances, highlighting how cannabis and dissociatives can significantly amplify the visual, cognitive, and perceptual experiences associated with psychedelics, while also increasing associated risks such as anxiety, confusion, nausea, and psychosis. It is part of a comprehensive overview of drug interactions under the section on effects and safety considerations of psilocybin mushrooms.\n                "}
