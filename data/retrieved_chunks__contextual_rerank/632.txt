Morphine and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13 with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers the production and usage of morphine, highlighting its source from the opium poppy and global manufacturing estimates, as well as its chemical classification as a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid within the morphinan class, providing vital background on its origins, chemical structure, and industrial relevance.\n                "}
