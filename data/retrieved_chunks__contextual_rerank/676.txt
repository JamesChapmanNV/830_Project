This is done to act as a deterrent to prevent their recreational use but can easily be circumvented with the use of a cold water extraction.\n\n\n\nCo-codamol contain 500mg of paracetamol per 8mg of codeine. It is available behind the counter in any British pharmacy.\n\n\n\nNurofen plus contain 12.8mg of codeine alongside ibuprofen. It is available behind the counter in any British pharmacy. Due to the higher codeine content than co-codamol, they are better for cold water extraction.\n\n\n\nMany prescription-strength cough syrups contain codeine and promethazine - an antihistamine. When used recreationally they are commonly known as lean or purple drank.\n\nToxicity and harm potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the common forms and preparations of codeine available worldwide, including over-the-counter medications like co-codamol and Nurofen Plus, as well as prescription cough syrups mixed with promethazine. It emphasizes the potential dangers of combining these formulations at high doses and provides insight into their recreational use and associated risks, complementing the broader discussion of codeine's effects, toxicity, and harm potential.\n                "}
