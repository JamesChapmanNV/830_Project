The distinct style of stimulation which MDMA presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily body shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control. Unlike most other stimulants, however, the stimulating effects of MDMA can also paradoxically be accompanied by persistent or wave-like feelings of deep sedation and relaxation , depending on the dose, with lower doses exemplifying a more relaxing or sedative quality. However in moderate to high doses it acts more similar to traditional stimulants; resulting in a nearly invariable desire to move around and engage in various kinds of mobile activities. This encouraged style of stimulation for some individuals is well reputed for resulting  very physically active behaviors such as dancing if said user is inclined or open to such activities.
