This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position). In the case of an overdose, it is advised to administer a dose of naloxone intravenously or intramuscularly to counteract the effects of the substance.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.\n\nTolerance and addiction potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the toxic and dangerous effects of fentanyl, highlighting risks such as nausea, vomiting, and the potential for fatal aspiration during overdose.
