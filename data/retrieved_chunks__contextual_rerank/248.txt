This should be used with extreme caution, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. This interaction can also amplify the anxiety, confusion and delusion producing aspects of cannabis significantly. Those who choose to use this combination are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose, and slow down the pace of their normal intake considerably.\n\nDissociatives - Dissociatives can enhance the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects of psilocybin mushrooms. Dissociative-induced holes, spaces, and voids while under the influence of psilocybin can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone, along with more intense internal hallucinations, confusion, nausea, delusions and increased risk of psychosis.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the combination effects of psilocybin mushrooms with other substances, highlighting how cannabis and dissociatives can significantly amplify the visual, cognitive, and perceptual experiences associated with psychedelics, while also increasing associated risks such as anxiety, confusion, nausea, and psychosis. It is part of a comprehensive overview of drug interactions under the section on effects and safety considerations of psilocybin mushrooms.\n                "}

Users are advised to be discerning about who they take LSD with. Thought acceleration Thought connectivity - A signature effect. Thoughts may feel more fluid and interconnected than usual. May occur alongside conceptual thinking and creativity enhancement . Thought loops - Typically occurs at higher doses, and at the peak of the experience. Often accompanied by ego loss . This effect may become exacerbated or triggered by cannabis or stimulants. Time distortion - A signature effect. The user's perception of time may be strongly altered. Typically takes the form of time dilation, or the experience of time slowing down and passing much slower than it does while sober. Wakefulness - Users report that it is difficult or impossible to go to sleep for up to 10 hours (or more) after LSD ingestion. Addiction suppression [47] - Some research suggests LSD can be used to treat addiction.
