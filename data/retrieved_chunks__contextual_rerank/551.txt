Morphine acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain but has a high potential for addiction, with tolerance and both physical and psychological dependence developing rapidly. Morphine is the most abundant opiate found in Papaver somniferum (the opium poppy). It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a vasodilator agent, an anaesthetic, a drug allergen and a geroprotector. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a tertiary amino compound and a morphinane alkaloid. It is a conjugate base of a morphine(1+). It derives from a hydride of a morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed chemical identifiers, molecular weight, key dates, and a comprehensive overview of morphine's pharmacological properties, roles, chemical classification, and biochemical characteristics, aligning with the full webpage's focus on detailed chemical and pharmacological data of morphine for research and medical reference.\n                "}

It wasn't until after these military conflicts that morphine habituation gained a reputation as the \"soldier's disease\" or the \"army disease\".
