It is thus legal to possess codeine without a prescription, provided that it is compounded with at least one other active or inactive ingredient and that the dosage of each tablet, capsule, etc does not exceed 100 mg or 2.5% concentration in the case of liquid preparations.[citation needed]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the legal status of codeine in the United Kingdom, explaining its classification under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and specific exemptions under Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001.

The Procedure 1. Obtain a quantity of tablets containing codeine, check to see if they contain anything other than codeine, caffeine, acetaminophen or aspirin. If they do, and you don't know whether or not it will be a problem, your best bet is not to use them. Measure out your desired amount of codeine (ex. 64 mg = 8 tablets * 8 mg/tablet). You may want to add 2 extra tablets as it is quite likely you will lose some codeine in the procedure. As you get more experience with the procedure you will be able to get approx. 95% of the codeine extracted. 2. Measure out some nice hot water, use approx. 40 ml / 20 tablets or more if needed. I would suggest you don't go over 50 ml for 20 tablets. I don't know if the use of boiling water would destroy any of the codeine but your best bet is not to use it. Use hot water but not boiling. Make sure the tablets dissolve completely.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a step-by-step procedure for extracting codeine from OTC tablets, emphasizing measuring a desired dose, using hot water (not boiling), and filtering the solution.
