Preparations containing pure codeine (e.g., codeine phosphate tablets or codeine phosphate linctus) are available on prescription and are considered Schedule 8 (Controlled Drug (Possession without authority illegal)) [13] . Schedule 8 drugs are drugs that are available to be prescribed but are heavily restricted to prevent abuse and dependence [14] . Possessing Schedule 8 drugs without authority is a criminal offense and can have varying punishments depending on the state of prosecution.\n- Austria: Codeine is legal for medical use under the AMG (Arzneimittelgesetz Österreich) and illegal when sold or possessed without a prescription under the SMG (Suchtmittelgesetz Österreich).
