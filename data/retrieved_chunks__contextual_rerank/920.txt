It is often recommended that one either refrain from eating for approximately 6 to 8 hours beforehand, or eat a light meal 3 to 4 hours before if they are feeling physically fatigued. In the rare circumstances that pure psilocin is ingested this effect is considered to be much less prominent than it is with psilocybin mushrooms .\n- Excessive yawning - This effect seems to be uniquely pronounced among psilocin and related tryptamines. It can occur to a lesser degree on LSD and very rarely on psychedelic phenethylamines like mescaline . It typically occurs in combination with watery eyes .\n- Brain zaps - Although this effect is very rare, it can still occur for those susceptible to it. This component is however much less common and intense than it is with serotonin releasing agents such as MDMA .\n- Watery eyes\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details common physical side effects of psilocin, including changes in felt gravity, nausea mitigation strategies, excessive yawning often with watery eyes, potential for rare brain zaps, and watery eyes themselves.

These affect serotonin, the neurotransmitter in the brain that deals with both depression and drug craving. Sedatives such as Dalmane, chloral hydrate, Librium, phenobarbital, or even Valium are used, very carefully, on a short-term basis to treat anxiety or sleep disturbance problems. Antipsychotic medications such as Haldol, Thorazine, and others are also used to buffer the effects of unbalanced dopamine, the neurotransmitter that moderates paranoia and pleasurable sensation. In addition to treating the physical and psychological aspects of craving, treatment providers should stress group counseling and peer pressure for compulsive amphetamine users, as these forms of therapy work well for this population.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details common withdrawal symptoms from methamphetamine use, including sleep disturbances, increased hunger, and psychotic reactions, and describes medical treatment options such as antidepressants, sedatives, and antipsychotics.
