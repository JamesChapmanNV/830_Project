Hydrocodone is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, heroin, ethylmorphine, codeine, and oxycodone.\n\nPharmacology\n\nThe euphoria, anxiety suppression and pain relief effects appear to stem from the way in which opioids mimic endogenous endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's effects. It acts primarily on μ-opioid receptors, with about six times lesser affinity to δ-opioid receptors.\n\nIn the liver, hydrocodone is transformed into several metabolites. It has a serum half-life that averages 3.8 hours.[4] The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 converts it into hydromorphone, a more potent opioid.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers the chemical structure and pharmacological mechanisms of hydrocodone, highlighting its similarity to codeine, its action on μ-opioid receptors, and its metabolism into hydromorphone via CYP2D6.
