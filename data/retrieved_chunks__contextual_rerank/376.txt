A total of 172 consecutive cases were studied, including 18 in which death was attributed to oxycodone toxicity, 117 to combined drug toxicity, 23 to trauma, 9 to natural causes and 5 to another drug or drugs. The postmortem blood concentrations of oxycodone overlapped among the groups. The mean blood oxycodone concentration among the cases of oxycodone toxicity was 0.69 mg/L, combined drug toxicity 0.72 mg/L and trauma 0.62 mg/L. Concentrations were lower in cases of deaths attributed to natural causes and to another drug or drugs (mean each 0.087 mg/L). ...\n\nPMID:15831018\n\nWolf BC et al; J Forensic Sci 50 (1): 192-5 (2005)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes forensic case studies analyzing postmortem oxycodone blood levels in various cause-of-death scenarios, including overdose, combined drug toxicity, trauma, and natural causes. The reported blood concentrations show significant overlap across groups, with toxicity-related deaths having higher mean levels (~0.69-0.72 mg/L) compared to natural cause deaths (~0.087 mg/L). This data is relevant for understanding oxycodone's toxicological thresholds and overlaps in forensic investigations.\n                "}

This report presents the results of a review of autopsy and coroner's reports from 10 counties for the years 2000 and 2001 to locate cases with oxycodone or hydrocodone exposure as a leading cause of death. Eighty-eight cases were located. Twenty-four deaths were attributed to oxycodone alone. Mean and median postmortem oxycodone blood concentrations were 1.23 mg/L and 0.43 mg/L, respectively. The range was 0.12 to 8.0 mg/L, with 13 cases (54%) < or = 0.5 mg/L. Seventeen deaths were attributed to hydrocodone alone. Mean and median postmortem hydrocodone blood concentrations were 0.53 mg/L and 0.40 mg/L, respectively. The range was 0.12 to 1.6 mg/L, with 11 cases (65%) < or = 0.5 mg/L.
