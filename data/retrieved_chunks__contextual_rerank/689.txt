Prescribing methadone and benzodiazepines or CNS depressants simultaneously should be reserved for cases where alternative treatment options are inadequate. In addition, it is advisable to minimize dosages and durations to the essential minimum and closely monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt highlights critical safety warnings related to methadone's cardiotoxicity, specifically QTc prolongation and associated cardiac risks, as well as dangers from combining methadone with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants.
