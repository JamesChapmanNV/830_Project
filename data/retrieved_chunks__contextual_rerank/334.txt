Edgewood Arsenal provided MDA to Dr. Cattell as part of a research program exploring the possible use of MDA as one of several interrogation tools. Cattell later reported We didn't know whether it was dog piss or what it was we were giving him. Blauer's wife won $18,000 in damages in a legal suit against the state in 1955, but the army successfully hid its involvement.  In 1987, Blauer's daughters win a law suit against the federal government for $700,000 over it's role in their father's death. After Blauer's death, Edgewood terminated its investigation into MDA.

A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch with shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. With free base meth now obtained, the next step, as usual, is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract as described in Chapter 5. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The procedure for that is also described in\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the chemical process of converting methamphetamine free base into its hydrochloride salt, including neutralization with lye, extraction with toluene, and purification steps such as distillation. It is relevant within the broader manufacturing methods described in the document, emphasizing techniques for obtaining pure methamphetamine crystals suitable for distribution or use. Key details include color indicators of purity and the method of bubbling dry HCl gas to create crystalline salt.\n                "}
