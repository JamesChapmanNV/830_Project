Endogenous morphine binds preferentially to the μ3 opioid receptor.[28]\n\nMorphine along with hydromorphone and oxymorphone experience minimal CYP450 metabolism and are instead metabolized primarily by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), specifically the UG2B7 isozyme.[29] About 90% of Morphine is converted into metabolites, primarily into the glucuronide conjugates morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) (45-55%) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) (10-15%).[30] Of these two MG3 has a low affinity for the opioid receptors and no analgesic activity. MG6 binds to the same receptor sites as morphine, but has a greater affinity and greater potency.[30]\n\nBinding affinities of morphine (Ki)[31]\n\nA lower Ki, indicates a greater binding affinity for the receptor.\n\nMu opioid agonist - 4.9 nM\n\nKappa opioid agonist - 206 nM\n\nDelta opioid agonist - 273 nM\n\nSubjective effects\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the pharmacokinetics and receptor binding of morphine, highlighting its endogenous production, primary metabolic pathways via UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and its affinity for opioid receptors with specific Ki values.
