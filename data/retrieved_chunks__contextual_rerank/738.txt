The nausea experienced with codeine is less common and less intense than that experienced with the stronger opiates such as morphine. A tip to all those using opiates, lying down does wonders to the nausea. If you ever experience nausea on opiates it is different than the commonly experienced nausea as it is more of a light-headed nausea. Lying down will almost always relieve the nausea in a couple minutes, which after you can attempt to stand up again. Codeine is a _excellent_ opiate to start experimenting with. Although the euphoria is not as intense as that experienced with the stronger opiates, the euphoria can still be quite intense. It also must be noted that like most other drugs, some experience is required before the full effects can be noticed and enjoyed. The best dose to start at is the 30 mg - 60 mg dosage. That way you won't experience many adverse effects and you can continue to take this\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the Erowid drug information webpage provides details on the adverse effects, dosage recommendations, and practical tips for safe use of codeine, highlighting its relatively mild side effects, euphoria potential, and initial dosage guidance between 30-60 mg.

However, during initiation or dosage adjustments, patients should be counseled by their prescribing clinician about the drug's ability to affect their cognitive state, especially if that patient intends to drive or operate heavy machinery while on the medication until tolerance develops to this adverse effect. When prescribed codeine, patients should also receive counsel regarding the risk associated with exposure to other mind-altering substances. The concomitant use of codeine with other known sedatives, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, can significantly increase the risk of adverse and possibly dangerous effects. Naloxone availability can help as a specific antidote to reverse significant opioid overdose or CNS depression, even when these are secondary to concomitant use with other CNS depressing agents.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the potential central nervous system adverse effects of codeine, such as sedation and clouded mentation, highlighting the importance of patient counseling on tolerance development, driving risks, and interactions with sedatives or alcohol.
