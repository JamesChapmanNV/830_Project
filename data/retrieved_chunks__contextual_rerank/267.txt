It is also commonly used as an alternative to [methadone] for the treatment of severe opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously. Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet. Buprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes the pharmacological profile and clinical use of buprenorphine, highlighting its role as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and treatment option for severe pain and opioid addiction. It details its formulation, combination with naloxone to reduce abuse potential, and key pharmacokinetic properties, situating it within the comprehensive chemical and pharmacological data provided in the full PubChem webpage.\n                "}
