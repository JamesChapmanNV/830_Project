Morphine levels reaching 1610 ng/mL were obtained within 24 hours of pellet implant. The studies showed that 24 hours after implant with 8 mg pellets morphine levels were 904 ng/mL while mice implanted with 25 and 75 mg dose pellets had mean blood levels of 1299 and 1610 ng/mL. The bioavailability of morphine in these pellets was not linear and the release on corticosterone was very similar for all three pellet sizes. /Morphine sulfate/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the pharmacokinetics of morphine following pellet implantation in animal studies, highlighting blood level measurements at various doses and time points within 24 hours.
