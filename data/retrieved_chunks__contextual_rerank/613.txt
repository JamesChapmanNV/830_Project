At 10 hours post-ingestion the patient was found unconscious. He had aspirated stomach contents into his lungs. His respiration, blood pressure, and pulse were all severely depressed. He never regained conciousness, and he died 5 days later. The medical examiner's finding was probable acute methadone intoxication.

The use is also linked with acute hepatic injury, especially in higher doses and in combination with high acetaminophen doses.\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\nWhen a person overdoses on oxycodone, an opioid antagonist such as naloxone should be administered. Clinicians should not give opioid antagonists such as naloxone in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression. Repeat dosing may be necessary as the duration of action of these drugs can vary from 30 to 120 minutes. The FDA has recently approved a 4 mg naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray for over-the-counter usage, the first naloxone product sanctioned for nonprescription use.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed information on the clinical signs, symptoms, and management of oxycodone overdose, including key adverse effects such as respiratory depression, bradycardia, and miosis.

Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to Oxycodone overdose.
