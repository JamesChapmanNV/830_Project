Also converted to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide. Virtually all morphine is converted to glucuronide metabolites; only a small fraction (less than 5%) of absorbed morphine is demethylated. Route of Elimination: A small amount of glucuronide conjugates are excreted in bile, with minor enterohepatic recycling. Seven to 10% of administered morphine sulfate is excreted in the feces.

It emphasizes that morphine's elimination route involves bile excretion and minor fecal passage, with a typical half-life of 2-4 hours, similar to the epidural half-life of 90 minutes reported later.
