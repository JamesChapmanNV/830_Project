Patients should receive counseling about the drug's addiction potential and be advised to avoid other CNS sedatives during each visit. Family members or caregivers should be educated about the signs and symptoms of buprenorphine toxicity. Patients should also be informed about appropriate actions to take in the event of lethargy or depressed respiration.\n\nTo ensure continuity in care, healthcare workers need to communicate all aspects of the treatment during weekly meetings to prevent omissions or overlaps in buprenorphine dosing.
