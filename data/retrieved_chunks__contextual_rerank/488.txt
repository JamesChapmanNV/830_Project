Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether a drug you are taking is an MAOI. Also be aware that some antidepressants (e.g. Prozac and Zoloft) may inhibit some of the effects of MDMA. MDMA is thought by many to be a fairly safe drug, as long as you keep track of what your body is telling you (see Section III below for more discussion of safety). The euphoria that it induces can make it easy to ignore bodily distress signals, so be watchful for things like dehydration (drink lots of water or fruit juices!), muscle cramping, dizziness, exhaustion or overexertion. Several reports from England tell of dosed ravers dancing themselves into severe dehydration and heat exhaustion that required hospitalization and in a few cases resulted in death. An MDMA overdose is characterized by high pulse or blood pressure, faintness, muscle cramping, or panic attacks. If you experience any of these symptoms, sit down, rest, and drink some fruit juice,\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the MDMA FAQ discusses safety precautions and overdose symptoms, emphasizing the importance of monitoring bodily signals, avoiding interactions with MAOIs, and recognizing signs of overdose such as high pulse, muscle cramps, and dizziness. It highlights the risks of dehydration and heat exhaustion in settings like raves, making it a key section on harm reduction within the broader drug safety and information resource.\n                "}

Most users consider this to be a waste of their tripping experience, especially as it can make them sick to their stomachs. While fatalities caused by the direct pharmacological effects of ketamine are nearly unheard of at normal recreational doses, ketamine is a powerful anaesthetic and being anaesthetized, semi-conscious, or unconscious carries distinct risks. Body positions that restrict breathing or blood-flow (e.g. \"child's pose\" or face down into a pillow) can result in serious injury or death even if the person is conscious. Extreme care should be taken before combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, opiates, barbiturates, and/or benzodiazepines. This can be very dangerous. While most (if not all) of these combinations have been used without negative incident, this does NOT mean that they should be considered safe. Opiates/opioids such as heroin are\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the ketamine FAQ discusses the risks and dangers of overdose, highlighting that while fatalities from direct effects are rare, severe injury or death can occur if body positions restrict breathing or blood flow.
