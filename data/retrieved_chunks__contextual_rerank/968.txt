The nausea experienced with codeine is less common and less intense than that experienced with the stronger opiates such as morphine. A tip to all those using opiates, lying down does wonders to the nausea. If you ever experience nausea on opiates it is different than the commonly experienced nausea as it is more of a light-headed nausea. Lying down will almost always relieve the nausea in a couple minutes, which after you can attempt to stand up again. Codeine is a _excellent_ opiate to start experimenting with. Although the euphoria is not as intense as that experienced with the stronger opiates, the euphoria can still be quite intense. It also must be noted that like most other drugs, some experience is required before the full effects can be noticed and enjoyed. The best dose to start at is the 30 mg - 60 mg dosage. That way you won't experience many adverse effects and you can continue to take this\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the Erowid drug information webpage provides details on the adverse effects, dosage recommendations, and practical tips for safe use of codeine, highlighting its relatively mild side effects, euphoria potential, and initial dosage guidance between 30-60 mg.

The taste isn't really bad but it's similar to sucking on a lemon. (One gets used to the taste after a while.:)) 6. Sit back and wait for the effects. Because the codeine is already in solution it only needs to be absorbed, while codeine in the tablet form must dissolve before being absorbed. Because of this, the effects will probably become noticeable within 15min.
