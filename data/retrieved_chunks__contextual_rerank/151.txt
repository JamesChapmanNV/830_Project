However, it is known that CBD acts on cannabinoid (CB) receptors of the endocannabinoid system, which are found in numerous areas of the body, including the peripheral and central nervous systems (such as the brain)). The endocannabinoid system regulates many physiological responses of the body including pain, memory, appetite, and mood.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers the chemistry and pharmacology of cannabidiol (CBD), detailing its natural occurrence in cannabis, chemical production pathway, physical properties, and its action on the body's endocannabinoid system, highlighting its role in regulating pain, mood, and physiological responses. It provides foundational scientific information relevant to understanding CBD's molecular structure, sources, and biological mechanisms within the broader discussion of its effects and medical potential.\n                "}
