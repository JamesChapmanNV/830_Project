Should I stop taking morphine?\n\nSometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.If you have been taking morphine regularly or have a dependency (also called opioid use disorder), you should not stop suddenly (also called “cold turkey”). Stopping an opioid medication suddenly could cause you to go into withdrawal. It is not known if or how withdrawal might affect a pregnancy. It is suggested that any reduction in morphine be done slowly, and under the direction of your healthcare provider.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk contains patient-oriented guidance on considerations for pregnancy and opioid use, emphasizing the importance of consulting healthcare providers before discontinuing or reducing morphine during pregnancy. It is relevant within the full document’s comprehensive overview of morphine, including pharmacology, safety, toxicity, and clinical use, providing critical information for pregnant patients or healthcare providers managing opioid therapy in pregnancy. Key details include the risks of sudden discontinuation and the recommendation for gradual reduction under medical supervision.\n                "}

The occurrence of these compounds in tap water in this region is also investigated and a preliminary human health risk characterization performed for those substances found in tap water. Finally, a screening level risk assessment that combines the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data to estimate Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the compounds studied is also presented. The results of this study show the presence of fourteen out of the nineteen compounds analyzed in winter and twelve of them in summer. The most ubiquitous compounds, with a frequency of detection of 100% in both seasons, were the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE), the amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) ephedrine (EPH), the opioid\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses environmental monitoring of illicit drugs and their metabolites, specifically analyzing seasonal variations, occurrence in surface and tap water, and human health risk assessments in the Madrid region. It provides data on detection frequencies and concentrations of compounds like benzoylecgonine and ephedrine, highlighting water contamination concerns. Its content is relevant for researchers focused on pharmaceutical environmental impact, water safety, and pollutant analysis within the broader document on morphine and related substances.\n                "}
