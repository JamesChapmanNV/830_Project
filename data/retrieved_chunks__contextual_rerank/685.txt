The terrorists threatened to kill everyone inside unless Russia ended the war in Chechnya. Although the Chechen militants agreed to release some of the hostages during the first couple of days, negotiations with the Russian authorities eventually stalled. Just before dawn on October 26, Russian special police units resorted to using an incapacitating gas based on the drug fentanyl to end the crisis. All of the Chechen militants were killed, and most of the civilian captives survived. But while the operation was largely a success, at least 117 of the hostages died from the effects of the gas. /Incapacitating gas based on the drug fentanyl/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a historical incident involving the use of fentanyl-based incapacitating gas during the 2002 Moscow theater crisis, highlighting fentanyl's role in mass casualty events and its serious toxicological effects. It is relevant to the document’s comprehensive overview of fentanyl's safety, hazards, and societal impact, emphasizing its potent and dangerous nature in real-world scenarios. Key details include the event timeline, the use of fentanyl gas to resolve the hostage situation, and the resulting fatalities.\n                "}
