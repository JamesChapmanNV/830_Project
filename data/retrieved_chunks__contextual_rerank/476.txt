This could make it harder to get pregnant.\n\n◈ Does taking codeine during pregnancy increase the chance of miscarriage?\n\nMiscarriage is common and can occur in any pregnancy for many reasons. It is not known if using codeine can increase the chance of miscarriage.\n\n◈ Does taking codeine increase the chance of birth defects?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes research findings on the reproductive risks associated with codeine use, addressing its potential impact on fertility, miscarriage, and birth defects. It is relevant within the broader document, which provides comprehensive information on codeine's pharmacology, safety, toxicity, and medical considerations. The content highlights current uncertainties and the need for further research on codeine's effects during pregnancy.\n                "}

This concentration is _so_ low that this FAQ will not be discussing cough syrups as a source of recreational codeine. The tablet form of OTC codeine products usually also includes 15 mg of caffeine in each standard dose. [In Canada the law dictates that all codeine OTC products must contain at least two other active ingredients. This usually translates into caffeine and acetominophen/APAP.] Prescription codeine containing products are usually not available without another drug included such as acetaminophen. Rx (prescription) products include the Tylenol w/ codeine series (#1,2,3,4) containing respectively 8 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg of codeine. Each tablet also contains caffeine in doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, 30 mg and 0 mg respectively. Thus Tylenol #4 w/ codeine (the most desired one) contains 325 mg of acetaminophen, 60 mg of codeine and no caffeine. Another Rx product is the 222, 292, 293, 294 series.

It explains that OTC cough syrups contain too low a concentration of codeine (3.3 mg/ml) to be relevant for recreational use and describes common tablet-based prescription options like Tylenol with codeine series, including dosages and ingredients such as acetaminophen and caffeine. This information is crucial for understanding legal limits, product variations, and extraction considerations discussed elsewhere in the document.\n                "}
