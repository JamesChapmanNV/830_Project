Two juvenile females were discovered unresponsive and hypoxic by a male acquaintance. The trio had reportedly crushed and snorted Opana ER tablets and consumed Xanax for recreational purposes. Emergency personnel were able to stabilize one female. The second female was pronounced dead at the scene. Blood and urine samples from the surviving female were collected at the trauma center between 48 and 96 hr post incident. Toxicology results showed the presence of oxymorphone, doxylamine, dextromethorphan, alprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, oxazepam, and temazepam in her urine. No drugs were detected in her blood. Toxicology on the deceased female revealed the presence of 0.13 mg/L oxymorphone and 0.04 mg/L alprazolam in her blood. Gastric contents contained 0.25 and 0.93 mg/L of oxymorphone and alprazolam, respectively.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section summarizes case reports of illicit abuse and overdose involving extended-release oxymorphone (Opana ER), often combined with other substances like alprazolam, highlighting toxicology findings and fatal outcomes.

Other names for MDMA include Molly, ecstasy, E, X, XTC, and Mandy. MDMA can be taken by mouth as a pill or capsule or snorted / inhaled as a powder.If you have been using MDMA, please seek help right away. Treatment is available to help you stop using MDMA. Talk with your healthcare providers; they are there to help you.\n\n◈ I am taking MDMA, but I would like to stop taking it before getting pregnant. How long does the drug stay in my body?\n\nPeople eliminate drugs at different rates. In healthy adults, it takes up to 4 days, on average, for most of the MDMA to be gone from the body.\n\n◈ I take MDMA. Can it make it harder for me to get pregnant?\n\nIt is not known if MDMA can make it harder to get pregnant.\n\n◈ Does taking MDMA increase the chance for miscarriage?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides information on MDMA's effects during pregnancy and lactation, including its potential impact on conception, pregnancy outcomes, and drug elimination timeframes.
