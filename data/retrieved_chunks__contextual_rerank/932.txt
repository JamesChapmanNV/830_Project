Opioids are sometimes called narcotics. Methadone has been used to treat opioid use disorder (to help people stop using heroin or other opioid medication). Methadone has also been used to treat pain.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.If you have been taking methadone regularly you should not just stop taking it suddenly. Stopping an opioid medication suddenly could cause you to go into withdrawal. It is not known if or how withdrawal might affect a pregnancy. If you & your healthcare team decide to cut back on methadone, it is suggested that any reduction be done slowly and under\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of methadone as an opioid medication used for opioid use disorder and pain management, emphasizing caution during pregnancy and the importance of medical guidance when adjusting dosage.
