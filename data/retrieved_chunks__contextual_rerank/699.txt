That way you can dissolve 20 tablets in 50 ml of hot water, cool the water down to 10C, filter the solution and end up with the same amount of codeine as the tablets contained but only a fraction of the original amount of A/A. It must be noted that because most of the caffeine will also be in the finished product, using large amount of tablets in the following procedure will result in large amount of caffeine in the finished product. For example the use of 20 tablets will result in about 300 mg of caffeine in the finished product (15 mg/tablets * 20 tablets). I personally haven't experienced any adverse reactions due to this amount of caffeine. Because of codeine's sedative effects the \"jitters\" and other adverse effects of large amount of caffeine are not experienced. The Procedure 1.

It highlights that most caffeine remains in the final product, with an example indicating about 300 mg of caffeine from 20 tablets. The section concludes with instructions for obtaining tablets containing codeine for this process.\n                "}
