For the analytes detected after intake of heroin (6-acetylmorphine (6-AM), morphine and codeine), long-time stability in real life whole blood samples are studied in only a small number of cases. Whole blood post mortem (n=37) and whole blood samples from living persons (n=22) containing morphine and codeine as well as 6-AM in blood or urine were selected. All cases represented intake of heroin. All samples contained fluoride and were initially analyzed and stored in normal conditions (-20 °C) for 4-9 years. All samples were then reanalyzed using the same analytical methods and the results were compared. For samples from living persons, the median change in concentration was -3.7% for morphine and -5.3% for codeine. For post mortem samples, the median change in concentration was -12% for morphine and -11% for codeine. Both for samples from living persons and post mortem samples, the decrease in the concentrations\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the stability and storage considerations of opioids such as codeine and morphine in forensic samples, detailing long-term stability data from post-mortem and living blood specimens stored for 4-9 years at -20°C. It highlights the minimal concentration changes observed, emphasizing the importance of consistent analysis methods for accurate toxicological interpretation.
