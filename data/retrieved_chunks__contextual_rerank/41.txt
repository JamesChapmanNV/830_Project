Secondly: 50 times more CBD than THC is needed to reduce acute effects of THC,[26] which makes it practically impossible to administer proper dosage by inhalation. Also, the quantity of CBD converted into THC will increase a lot with the required ratio, and excessive harshness in the lungs may escalate a bad trip.\n\nToxicity and harm potential\n\nAccording to clinical studies, cannabidiol is well-tolerated and shows little to no toxicity.[27]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section summarizes current research on cannabidiol’s potential antipsychotic effects, risks associated with vaping or smoking CBD (notably the conversion to THC at high temperatures), and its overall low toxicity profile based on clinical studies, highlighting both therapeutic prospects and safety considerations within the broader overview of CBD's pharmacology and harm potential.\n                "}

As such, it may contain incomplete or invalid information. You can help by expanding upon or correcting it.\n\nCannabidiol can be an inhibitor of CYP enzymes (including CYP3A4),[30] which are involved in the metabolism of many psychoactive substances. As a result, it has the potential to cause dangerous interactions. Caution is advised when combining cannabidiol with other substances, particularly with higher doses.\n\nLegal status\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers the commonly reported side effects, dependence and abuse potential, dangerous interactions, and legal status of cannabidiol (CBD), providing essential safety and legal information that complements the broader discussion of CBD's pharmacology, effects, and medical use in the webpage.\n                "}
