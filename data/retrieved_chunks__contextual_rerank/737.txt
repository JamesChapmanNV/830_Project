It reaches its maximum effect in around 20 min when given intravenously and 60 min when given orally while the duration of effect is between three and seven hours.[8][9] Long-acting formulations also exist such as, Kadian which is capable of producing clinically significant effects for upwards of 24 hours.[10][11]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of morphine's historical discovery, subjective effects, and methods of administration, highlighting its potent pain-relief properties, side effects like respiratory depression, and common routes of use with onset times and duration.

It wasn't until after these military conflicts that morphine habituation gained a reputation as the \"soldier's disease\" or the \"army disease\". With the addictive and habit forming properties of morphine now known the medical establishment was on the lookout for a less addictive alternative to morphine. This came in the form of diacetylmorphine or as it was later marketed, Heroin. Although it was later learned that heroin was not less addictive than codeine and in fact the contrary.

The taste isn't really bad but it's similar to sucking on a lemon. (One gets used to the taste after a while.:)) 6. Sit back and wait for the effects. Because the codeine is already in solution it only needs to be absorbed, while codeine in the tablet form must dissolve before being absorbed. Because of this, the effects will probably become noticeable within 15min.
