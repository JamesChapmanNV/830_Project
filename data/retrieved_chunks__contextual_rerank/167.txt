It is thus legal to possess codeine without a prescription, provided that it is compounded with at least one other active or inactive ingredient and that the dosage of each tablet, capsule, etc does not exceed 100 mg or 2.5% concentration in the case of liquid preparations.[citation needed]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the legal status of codeine in the United Kingdom, explaining its classification under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and specific exemptions under Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001.
