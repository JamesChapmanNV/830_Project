Depressants such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB or alcohol can amplify ketamine's suppressant effects on breathing and heart rate, possibly causing cardiovascular and respiratory functions to slow dangerously or discontinue altogether. In one fatality case, where the death was attributed to ketamine in combination with another dissociative anaesthetic and tranquiliser known as Tylazol, the autopsy revealed cardiomegaly (enlargement of the heart) and hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen).5 In another case, asthma was listed as a joint cause of death along with ketamine,3 again most likely due to the respiratory suppressant effect of the substance.

A sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was suspected, whereas a traumatic cause of death was excluded regarding autopsy findings. Specimens were submitted to a large toxicological analysis, which included ethanol measurement by HS-GC-FID, a targeted screening for drugs of abuse and various prescription drug classes followed by quantification using UPLC-MS/MS methods. Methadone and its metabolite (EDDP) were detected in all the tested fluids, as well as in hair, with a blood concentration of methadone considered as lethal for children (73 ng/mL). The cause of death was determined to be acute \"methadone poisoning\", and the manner of death was \"accidental\". A discussion of the case circumstances, the difficulties with the interpretation of toxicological findings in children (blood concentration and hair testing), and the origin of exposure are discussed.\n\nPMID:24588273\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a fatal case of infant methadone poisoning, including toxicological analysis, blood concentration levels, and interpretative challenges, emphasizing the risks of accidental exposure.
