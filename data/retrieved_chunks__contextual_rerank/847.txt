Those using MDMA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength should be extremely careful. Based on research from multiple labs, the effects of MDMA can increase non-linearly with increases in dosage. That is, increasing dosage from 100mg to 120mg (a 20% increase in dosage) can cause more than a 20% increase in experiential effects level. See Harris DS, Baggott M, et al. 2002 and de la Torre R, Farre M, et al. 2000. The current theory is that some metabolic pathway becomes saturated/overwhelmed somewhere around 1.5mg/kg and above, resulting in higher plasma levels and effects levels. The specific metabolic reason for this non-linearity has not yet been proven.\n\nCAUTION & DISCLAIMER #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the potential risks and effects of MDMA, including neurotoxicity and rare death occurrences, and emphasizes the importance of caution due to individual sensitivity and non-linear dosage effects, providing critical safety information within the broader MDMA effects overview.\n                "}

Captive markets such as raves generally produce high prices while friend to friend it is often sold at cheaper prices. Less common forms of LSD sell for somewhat higher prices ($8-10 for a single hit), and as with most substances, the price goes down if you buy in bulk. Sheets of 100 hits (blotter) generally range from $1-$2 per hit. One of the more novel things about the illicit LSD market is that within the LSD using community, it is somewhat common to give single doses away to friends and acquaintances at extremely cheap prices, if not free.\n\nLaw #\n\nLSD is illegal in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries.
