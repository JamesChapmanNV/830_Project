Following an observed spike of heroin-fentanyl related deaths in Melbourne, Australia, a study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of these cases. All reportable deaths occurring in Victoria during 2015 and submitted to the toxicology laboratory were analysed using LC-MS-MS to confirm the combination of the heroin marker 6-acetylmorphine and/or morphine, and fentanyl. Over 4,000 coronial cases in 2015 underwent toxicological analysis for these drugs, there were nine cases identified that involved fentanyl-laced heroin. ... The ages ranged from 25 to 57 years with an average of 40 and median of 37 years, and consisted of eight males and one female. The average and median femoral blood concentration of fentanyl was 18 and 20 ng/mL (range: <1-45 ng/mL), and morphine 140 and 80 ng/mL (range: 20-400 ng/mL), respectively. All nine cases had 6-acetylmorphine detectable in blood. Urine analysis was also performed where available. ...\n\nPMID:28158759\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details forensic findings from a 2015 spike in heroin-fentanyl related deaths in Melbourne, Australia, highlighting toxicology analysis results, fentanyl blood concentrations, and demographic data.
