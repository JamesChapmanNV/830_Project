Morphine should be used with caution in patients with toxic psychoses. Several manufacturers recommended that morphine sulfate should not be used in patients with known or suspected paralytic ileus. All opioid analgesics are metabolized by the liver and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease because increased bioavailability after oral administration of cumulative effects may occur. Morphine has the potential to precipitate or exacerbate asthmatic attacks and should be avoided in patients with a history of asthma. An increased fracture risk is seen in users of morphine and opiates. The reason for this may be related to the risk of falls due to central nervous system effects such as dizziness.
