Activated charcoal may be administered to reduce gastrointestinal absorption while noting time-dependent efficacy. Intravenous fluids are essential for flushing the drug from the system while maintaining acid-base balance and electrolyte levels. Gastric lavage can be considered to remove stomach contents, and laxatives may be used to induce defecation, facilitating further elimination of the drug. Hemodialysis may enhance the clearance of both pethidine and its metabolite, normeperidine. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is the primary treatment for reversing opioid-induced effects. In cases of hypertension and hyperpyrexia, intravenous chlorpromazine can be administered. Following initial recovery, patients should be referred to addiction treatment programs to address the underlying addiction and support rehabilitation.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed emergency management protocols for pethidine overdose, including airway stabilization, gastrointestinal decontamination, supportive care, hemodialysis, opioid antagonists, and adjunctive treatments.
