Should I stop taking morphine?\n\nSometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.If you have been taking morphine regularly or have a dependency (also called opioid use disorder), you should not stop suddenly (also called “cold turkey”). Stopping an opioid medication suddenly could cause you to go into withdrawal. It is not known if or how withdrawal might affect a pregnancy. It is suggested that any reduction in morphine be done slowly, and under the direction of your healthcare provider.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk contains patient-oriented guidance on considerations for pregnancy and opioid use, emphasizing the importance of consulting healthcare providers before discontinuing or reducing morphine during pregnancy.
