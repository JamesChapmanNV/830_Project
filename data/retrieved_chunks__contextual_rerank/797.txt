The taste isn't really bad but it's similar to sucking on a lemon. (One gets used to the taste after a while.:)) 6. Sit back and wait for the effects. Because the codeine is already in solution it only needs to be absorbed, while codeine in the tablet form must dissolve before being absorbed. Because of this, the effects will probably become noticeable within 15min.

Codeine is closely related to morphine as both contain an oxygen group at R3, but this oxygen group in codeine is substituted by a methyl group (making a methoxy group). Codeine is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, heroin, ethylmorphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone.\n\nPharmacology\n\nCodeine is not itself centrally active, and must first be converted via first-pass metabolism into morphine by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 (as such, it is a prodrug for morphine). Codeine is also metabolized into the inactive norcodeine via the CYP3A4 enzyme system. Both resultant forms are conjugated by UGT2B7 into their corresponding 3-glucuronide.[citation needed]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the chemical structure of codeine, highlighting its similarities and differences with morphine and other morphinans, such as dihydrocodeine and heroin. It explains how these structural features relate to its pharmacological activity, specifically its conversion to morphine via CYP2D6 metabolism, underscoring its status as a prodrug. This information is critical for understanding codeine’s chemical basis and metabolic processes.\n                "}
