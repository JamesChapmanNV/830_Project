Of recent concern is the cluster of unintentional fentanyl overdoses because of tablets thought to be \"Norco\" purchased on the street in Northern California. U-47700 (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-[2-(dimethyl-amino)cyclohexyl]-N-methylbenz-amide) is a nonfentanyl-based synthetic opioid with 7.5 times the binding affinity of morphine to mu-opioid. We report a case of fentanyl and U-47700 intoxication from what was thought to be illicitly purchased Norco. A 41-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) for altered mental status shortly after ingesting 3 beige Norco pills bearing a Watson imprint. She had pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression, which reversed after 0.4 mg naloxone administration intravenously.
