In nonhuman mammals, degeneration of monaminergic terminals and neuronal apoptosis (cell death) has been known to occur.[7] In humans the effects are also neurotoxic.[8] It also displays cardiotoxicity, including increased blood pressure and elevated risk of stroke and heart attack.\n\nIt is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.\n\n\n\nPure \"shards\" of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, commonly known as \"crystal meth\".\n\nContents\n\n1 History and culture\n\n2 Chemistry\n\n2.1 Stereoisomers\n\n3 Pharmacology\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the high abuse, addiction, and neurotoxic risks associated with methamphetamine, emphasizing its damaging effects on dopamine and serotonin neurons, as well as its cardiotoxicity.
