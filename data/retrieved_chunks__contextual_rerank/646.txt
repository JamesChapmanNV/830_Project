I don't know if the use of boiling water would destroy any of the codeine but your best bet is not to use it. Use hot water but not boiling. Make sure the tablets dissolve completely. Some dissolve on contact with water while others need some help dissolving by crushing them. Note : not all of the tablet will dissolve, there are water-insoluble fillers in the tablet and not all of the A/A will dissolve either(which is what we want). (Most sources recommend that codeine not be stored at temperatures in excess of 40C (104F), so its probably better to use warm, but not hot, water. I find that it is best to crash the tablets completely in a container, and then dissolve them in a glass with water.) 3. Place the solution in a cold bath, I just use some ice cubes in a container of water. Stir the mixture occasionally until the solution drops to about 15C or lower. You won't need a thermometer to measure the temperature, just make sure it's \"cold\". This will take about 30 min.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the extraction instructions explains the importance of using warm, not boiling, water to dissolve crushed tablets containing codeine and insoluble fillers, emphasizing the need to avoid high temperatures that could degrade the drug. It details the process of dissolving tablets, cooling the solution in a cold bath with ice cubes, and stirring until the mixture reaches about 15°C, which typically takes around 30 minutes.
