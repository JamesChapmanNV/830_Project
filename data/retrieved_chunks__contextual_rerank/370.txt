It was followed in the next decade by the introduction of the first quick-acting prescription formulations of fentanyl for personal use, the Actiq lollipop and Fentora buccal through the delivery method of estradiol Mylan transdermal patches. As of 2012, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice[15] with several new delivery methods now available, including a sublingual spray for cancer patients.[16][17] In 2013, 1700 kilograms were used globally.[18]\n\nChemistry\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the historical development and medical formulations of fentanyl, highlighting its introduction for palliative care in the 1990s, subsequent rapid-acting prescription products, and its widespread clinical use by 2012, including various delivery methods and global consumption data.
