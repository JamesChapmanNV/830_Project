From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s there was a growth of clinicians using MDMA (then known as \"Adam\") in California.[15]\n\nRecreational use of MDMA became popular at around the same time, particularly in nightclubs, eventually catching the attention of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). After several hearings, a US Federal Administrative Law Judge recommended that MDMA should be made a Schedule III controlled substance so that it could be used in the medical field. Despite this, the director of the DEA overruled this recommendation and classified MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance.[16][14]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section outlines the historical transition of MDMA from a legal, therapeutic tool introduced by Dr. Leo Zeff and clinicians in California during the 1970s-80s to its subsequent emergence as a popular recreational drug, leading to federal classification as a Schedule I controlled substance despite initial recommendations for medical use.\n                "}
