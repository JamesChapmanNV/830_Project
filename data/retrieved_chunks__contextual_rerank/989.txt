Doses used to relieve cough or diarrhea range from 5 mg to 30 mg. Codeine is absorbed quickly from the GI tract and it's first pass through the liver results in very little loss of the drug. This contrasts with morphine in which over 90% of the drug is metabolized in the first pass through the liver resulting in a considerable loss of potency when administered orally. This is why codeine is a common opiate in the relief of pain, the ease of oral administration. Codeine can be administered by many routes, this includes, SC, IM (intramuscularly), as an enema, and orally. Note, codeine can't be administered safely by IV (intravenously) injection as it can result in pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs), facial swelling and other life threatening complications. Codeine is converted to morphine during hapatic metabolism (see Pharmacology & Drug Interactions below). This of course will result in a positive result in a drug test for the opiates. It is not known whether or not\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the pharmacokinetics and administration routes of codeine, highlighting its rapid absorption, liver metabolism to morphine, and common usage dosages for cough and pain relief. It emphasizes safe administration methods and notes that codeine metabolism can lead to positive drug tests for opiates, making it relevant within the comprehensive guide on codeine's effects, extraction, and legal considerations.\n                "}

This is done to act as a deterrent to prevent their recreational use but can easily be circumvented with the use of a cold water extraction.\n\n\n\nCo-codamol contain 500mg of paracetamol per 8mg of codeine. It is available behind the counter in any British pharmacy.\n\n\n\nNurofen plus contain 12.8mg of codeine alongside ibuprofen. It is available behind the counter in any British pharmacy. Due to the higher codeine content than co-codamol, they are better for cold water extraction.\n\n\n\nMany prescription-strength cough syrups contain codeine and promethazine - an antihistamine. When used recreationally they are commonly known as lean or purple drank.\n\nToxicity and harm potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the common forms and preparations of codeine available worldwide, including over-the-counter medications like co-codamol and Nurofen Plus, as well as prescription cough syrups mixed with promethazine. It emphasizes the potential dangers of combining these formulations at high doses and provides insight into their recreational use and associated risks, complementing the broader discussion of codeine's effects, toxicity, and harm potential.\n                "}
