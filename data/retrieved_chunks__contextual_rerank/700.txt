The infant also had a recent history of fever. The mother had reportedly been breastfeeding the infant 3 times a day for several weeks and had taken 180 mg of oxycodone, as well as muscle relaxants, the day prior to her infant's death. A blood oxycodone level of 600 mcg/L was measured on autopsy. The medical examiner considered it unlikely that such a high level of oxycodone in the infant's blood could be due to breastfeeding exposure as reported by the mother and thus considered the death a homicide resulting from either the intentional administration of oxycodone directly to the infant or from a higher dose of oxycodone in breastmilk than that reported by the mother.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the full document discusses serious adverse effects of oxycodone in breastfeeding infants, highlighting a case where a 10-month-old infant died of cardiac arrest with a high blood oxycodone level after maternal use, emphasizing the risk of opioid transfer through breast milk and potential for lethal overdose.\n                "}
