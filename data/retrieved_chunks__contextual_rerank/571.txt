The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\n\nCodeine itself is a weak ligand for the opioid receptors. However, its main active metabolite, morphine, shows much stronger agonistic effects.\n\nBinding affinities (Ki)[9]\n\nMu opioid agonist - 589 nM\n\nKappa opioid agonist - 18061 nM\n\nDelta opioid agonist - 11442 nM\n\nSubjective effects\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the pharmacology of codeine, specifically how its active metabolite morphine binds to opioid receptors—primarily the μ-opioid receptor—to produce effects like euphoria and pain relief. It highlights morphine's stronger agonistic potency compared to codeine and provides binding affinity data, essential for understanding the drug's mechanism of action and subjective effects within the broader document.\n                "}
