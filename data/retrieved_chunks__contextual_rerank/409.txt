Eight drugs and metabolites were analyzed including 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrolidine (EDDP), fentanyl, norfentanyl, meperidine, normeperidine, methadone, phencyclidine and tramadol. These drugs were chosen because of their widespread abuse. Wastewater samples were collected at both the Oxford Waste Water Treatment Plant in Oxford, Mississippi (MS) and the University Wastewater Treatment Plant in University, MS. These wastewater samples were collected on weekends in which the University of Mississippi football team (colloquially the \"Ole Miss Rebels\" football team) held home games (Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, University, MS 38677). The collected samples were analyzed using a validated method and found to contain tramadol\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a wastewater analysis method for detecting drugs of abuse, including meperidine and its metabolites, using LC-MS/MS. It highlights sample collection from specific locations and times related to university football events, emphasizing the method's application in monitoring widespread drug abuse. This section is relevant for understanding analytical techniques and surveillance of narcotics within the broader dataset on meperidine’s properties, detection, and toxicology.\n                "}

The highest known accidental overdose of pregabalin during clinical development was 8000 mg; this event was without significant clinical consequences. The most commonly reported adverse events with overdose were reduced consciousness, confusional state, agitation, depression/anxiety, and restlessness in the postmarketing studies. In addition, heart block, seizures, and death have also been reported in some patients taking combination with other CNS depressants.\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed information on pregabalin toxicity, specifically overdose signs, symptoms, and management, situated within the larger section on toxicity and adverse effects in the full drug profile.

It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[12]\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nWarning: Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the increased risks associated with opioid overdose after cessation and relapse, highlighting the importance of reduced tolerance and environmental factors.
