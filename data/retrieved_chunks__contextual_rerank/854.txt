Other names for MDMA include Molly, ecstasy, E, X, XTC, and Mandy. MDMA can be taken by mouth as a pill or capsule or snorted / inhaled as a powder.If you have been using MDMA, please seek help right away. Treatment is available to help you stop using MDMA. Talk with your healthcare providers; they are there to help you.\n\n◈ I am taking MDMA, but I would like to stop taking it before getting pregnant. How long does the drug stay in my body?\n\nPeople eliminate drugs at different rates. In healthy adults, it takes up to 4 days, on average, for most of the MDMA to be gone from the body.\n\n◈ I take MDMA. Can it make it harder for me to get pregnant?\n\nIt is not known if MDMA can make it harder to get pregnant.\n\n◈ Does taking MDMA increase the chance for miscarriage?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides information on MDMA's effects during pregnancy and lactation, including its potential impact on conception, pregnancy outcomes, and drug elimination timeframes. It addresses common questions about MDMA use and reproductive health, making it relevant for clinicians, researchers, and users seeking safety and risk assessments related to pregnancy.\n                "}

Activated charcoal may be administered to reduce gastrointestinal absorption while noting time-dependent efficacy. Intravenous fluids are essential for flushing the drug from the system while maintaining acid-base balance and electrolyte levels. Gastric lavage can be considered to remove stomach contents, and laxatives may be used to induce defecation, facilitating further elimination of the drug. Hemodialysis may enhance the clearance of both pethidine and its metabolite, normeperidine. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is the primary treatment for reversing opioid-induced effects. In cases of hypertension and hyperpyrexia, intravenous chlorpromazine can be administered. Following initial recovery, patients should be referred to addiction treatment programs to address the underlying addiction and support rehabilitation.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed emergency management protocols for pethidine overdose, including airway stabilization, gastrointestinal decontamination, supportive care, hemodialysis, opioid antagonists, and adjunctive treatments.
