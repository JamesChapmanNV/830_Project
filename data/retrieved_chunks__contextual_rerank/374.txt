Patients may decrease their risk of next-morning impairment by taking the lowest dose of their insomnia medicine that treats their symptoms, according to the FDA.

At heavier more recreational dosages, additional effects which are usually associated with deliriants may become present. These include thought disorganization and delusions. The specific effects can be broken down into several components. These are described below and generally include:\n\nAmnesia - The amnesia following zolpidem varies greatly between people with some people not experiencing this effect as much while others experience complete blackouts for extended periods of time even at low or therapeutic dosages. There have been many cases of bizarre behavior where people can't recall the entire event.\n\nAnxiety suppression - Although anxiety suppression is definitely present, it usually only manifests itself at heavier dosages and is significantly weaker than that of benzodiazepines.\n\nCompulsive redosing\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the cognitive effects of zolpidem, including memory impairment, anxiety reduction, and potential delusions at higher doses.
