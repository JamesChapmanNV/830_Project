A methamphetamine overdose will likely also result in mild brain damage due to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotoxicity.[28][33] Death from fatal methamphetamine poisoning is typically preceded by convulsions and coma.[46]\n\nEmergency treatment\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the symptoms, risks, and emergency responses associated with methamphetamine overdose, highlighting its potential severity and the signs indicating toxic levels, which is crucial for understanding the drug's harm potential and safety considerations within the broader substance profile.\n                "}

Although the clinical scenarios may vary among patients, one of the main concerns is the level of expression of OIRD. In such cases, oxygen administration and respiratory assistance are a priority. An opioid drug antagonist such as naloxone can help to correct OIRD symptoms. Commonly, repeated doses are necessary since, over time, respiratory depression may overcome the effects of the antagonist drug, particularly with opiates such as fentanyl, in which increased receptor affinity may be present as compared to other opiates. Thus, the therapeutic approach should continue until a normal respiratory rate coincides with appropriate oxygen saturation levels.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a detailed description of typical clinical manifestations and emergency management strategies for fentanyl overdose, highlighting symptoms like respiratory depression and the use of naloxone.
