However, it is also not uncommon for people with general social prejudices against dance behavior to suddenly become much more openminded to the idea once under the influence of a sufficient (moderate) dose of MDMA. Tactile enhancement - MDMA produces distinct enhancements to tactile sensations. Users commonly report a sense of softness and fuzziness draping over their skin. Likewise, touching soft and fuzzy objects such as shag rugs can become irresistibly pleasurable and satisfying. MDMA-type tactile enhancement appears to be an effect unique to the entactogen class and may be a serotonin-related effect. Although it is also worth noting that many experimenters of the drug find that the tactile effects (especially in regards to pleasure) have often been notably exaggerated by other users, with some of these\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses MDMA's stimulating effects on physical activity and its distinctive tactile enhancements, highlighting increased enjoyment of touch and potential changes in social behavior related to dance.

Safety and Neurotoxicity Discussion\n\nBehavioral Safety Concerns\n\nAs noted, a primary psychological effect of MDMA is to make the user feel \"safe\", at peace with the world, pleasantly reconciled to things as they are, and things however they will be. This can remarkably diminish one's ability to make sound judgements during the session. Examples:\n\nIt becomes easy to want to prolong the MDMA state by taking more and more of the drug (or of other drugs), beyond what you would judge wise or worthwhile when not under its influence.\n\nIt becomes easier to have unsafe sex. You may \"forget,\" judge that the risk of infection is very small, or feel that infection wouldn't be such a terrible thing after all. If you think you might have sex while on MDMA, it may help you and your partner to stay safe if you lay out safer sex supplies before dosing in a place you'll be sure to see them later, and agree beforehand that you'll use them if the occasion arises.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides an important overview of safety and neurotoxicity considerations related to MDMA use, emphasizing behavioral safety concerns such as impaired judgment, risk of unsafe sex, and the potential neurological and psychological effects discussed in the overall document.\n                "}

This is usually reported as feeling comfortable in its sensations and even peaceful. Tactile enhancement - This effect is less prominent than with that of LSD or 2C-B but is still present and unique in its character. It is repeatedly described as feeling very primitive in its nature often times with the small hairs on the users arms or legs feeling slightly itchy or even ticklish against the skin. Changes in felt gravity Nausea - This effect can be greatly lessened or even completely avoided if the individual has an empty stomach prior to ingestion. It is often recommended that one either refrain from eating for approximately 6 to 8 hours beforehand, or eat a light meal 3 to 4 hours before if they are feeling physically fatigued. In the rare circumstances that pure psilocin is ingested this effect is considered to be much less prominent than it is with psilocybin mushrooms .
