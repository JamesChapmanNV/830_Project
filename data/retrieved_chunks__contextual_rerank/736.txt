Note that crystals may not be visible, and cloudiness may not indicate crystallization.] 5. Drink and enjoy! The solution will be _very_ bitter, so I mix a little Kool-aid powder into the solution. The taste isn't really bad but it's similar to sucking on a lemon. (One gets used to the taste after a while.:)) 6. Sit back and wait for the effects.

It emphasizes proper crystallization techniques and provides user tips for effective extraction. Its relevance lies in enabling readers to obtain recreational doses of codeine from over-the-counter products, which is central to the document's focus on codeine preparation and use.\n                "}
