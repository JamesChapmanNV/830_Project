The Rapid Stat tests (n = 134) were applied by police officers in routine traffic checks. Oral fluid and blood samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, and methylenedioxyamphetamine. The comparison of GC-MS analysis of oral fluid with the Rapid Stat results for cannabis showed a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 87%, and a total confirmation rate of 87%. When compared with serum, the sensitivity of the cannabis assay decreased to 71%, the specificity to 60%, and the total confirmation rate to 66%.

Genotyping was carried out for the CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3 and CYP2C19*4 alleles. DNA samples from 94 healthy blood donors were used as reference material. The number of mutant alleles in the high-ratio and low-ratio groups was significantly higher and lower, respectively, than in the reference material. The increased number of mutant alleles in the high-ratio group was not due to the presence of many poor metabolizers, but to a high number of heterozygous individuals with the genotype CYP2C19*1/*2. This result indicates a gene dosage effect where the carisoprodol : meprobamate ratio reflects the number of active CYP2C19 alleles. The metabolism of carisoprodol to meprobamate is dependent on CYP2C19 genotype. Heterozygous individuals with the CYP2C19*1/*2 genotype have a reduced capacity for metabolizing carisoprodol, and should probably be regarded as intermediate metabolizers of this drug. /Carisoprodol/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details genetic factors influencing carisoprodol metabolism, highlighting that the ratio of carisoprodol to meprobamate reflects CYP2C19 genotype variations, particularly the presence of CYP2C19*1/*2 heterozygous individuals, who have reduced metabolic capacity.
