Codeine from the ancient Greek, κώδεια, means cup shaped like a poppyhead.[17] Morphine use was spearheaded by Dr. Alexander Wood's invention the hypodermic syringe in 1853.[16][14] However, it wasn't until the American Civil War in 1861, the Prussian-Austrian War in 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 that morphine saw widespread use as part of military medicine. It wasn't until after these military conflicts that morphine habituation gained a reputation as the \"soldier's disease\" or the \"army disease\". With the addictive and habit forming properties of morphine now known the medical establishment was on the lookout for a less addictive alternative to morphine. This came in the form of diacetylmorphine or as it was later marketed, Heroin. Although it was later learned that heroin was not less addictive than codeine and in fact the contrary.

When the heroin base enters the body, it is fairly lipophilic, so a portion of the dose readily crosses the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system where the hydrolysis of the two esters can take place. Morphine is less lipophilic than heroin and does not cross back across the blood-brain barrier as readily. Morphine readily undergoes the additional phase I metabolic transformation of oxidative N-demethylation by CYP2D6. Phase II (conjugation) reactions of morphine include formation of the glucuronide conjugates at the hydroxyl moieties at positions 3 and 6. The glucuronides are then excreted. Note that the aromatic ring stays intact throughout the metabolic transformations, illustrating the stability imparted by aromaticity.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the metabolic pathway of heroin conversion to morphine, highlighting key processes such as ester hydrolysis, blood-brain barrier crossing, phase I oxidative N-demethylation by CYP2D6, and phase II conjugation forming glucuronide metabolites.
