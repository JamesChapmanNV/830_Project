(Ed); Remmington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. 21 st Edition. Lippincott Williams & Williams, Philadelphia, PA 2005, p. 1545\n\nLike other antihistamines, diphenhydramine should be used with caution in infants and young children and should not be used in premature or full-term neonates Children younger than 6 years of age should receive diphenhydramine only under the direction of a physician. Safety and efficacy of diphenhydramine as a nighttime sleep aid in children younger than 12 years of age have not been established. In addition, children may be more prone than adults to paradoxically experience CNS stimulation rather than sedation when antihistamines are used as nighttime sleep aids. Because diphenhydramine may cause marked drowsiness that may be potentiated by other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, tranquilizers), the antihistamine should be used in children receiving one of these drugs only under the direction of a physician.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from authoritative pharmacology literature emphasizes the pediatric safety considerations and cautions for using diphenhydramine, highlighting risks in infants, young children, and neonates. Its inclusion supports the full document's comprehensive overview of diphenhydramine’s pharmacology, safety profiles, and regulatory guidelines, providing detailed clinical guidance on vulnerable populations.\n                "}
