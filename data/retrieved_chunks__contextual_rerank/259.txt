Emergency personnel should wear protective clothing appropriate to the type and degree of contamination. Air-purifying or supplied-air respiratory equipment should also be worn, as necessary. Rescue vehicles should carry supplies such as plastic sheeting and disposable plastic bags to assist in preventing spread of contamination.\n\nInhalation Exposure:\n\n1. Move victims to fresh air. Emergency personnel should avoid self-exposure to amphetamine.\n\n2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support.\n\n3. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed emergency first aid procedures for acute amphetamine exposure, emphasizing decontamination, protective clothing, and respiratory support, complementing the comprehensive safety, hazard, and toxicity information in the full document.
