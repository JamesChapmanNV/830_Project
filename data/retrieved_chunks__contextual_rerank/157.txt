When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of morphine develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. Morphine presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of morphine all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the potential for dependence and abuse associated with morphine, emphasizing its high addictive potential, the development of tolerance over time, and the associated risks of physical and psychological dependence. It underscores the importance of harm reduction practices when using this opioid.\n                "}

It reaches its maximum effect in around 20 min when given intravenously and 60 min when given orally while the duration of effect is between three and seven hours.[8][9] Long-acting formulations also exist such as, Kadian which is capable of producing clinically significant effects for upwards of 24 hours.[10][11]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of morphine's historical discovery, subjective effects, and methods of administration, highlighting its potent pain-relief properties, side effects like respiratory depression, and common routes of use with onset times and duration.

Due to its addictive potential and overdose risk, hydromorphone is only prescribed when other first-line treatments have failed. The WHO has proposed a three-step ladder for the management of pain in which it is suggested to start with a non-opioid medication followed by addition of weak opioids to the non-opioid treatment for moderate pain and finishing in the use of strong opioids such as hydromorphone along with the existing regimen for cases of severe pain. Off-label, hydromorphone can be administered for the suppression of refractory cough.\n\nFDA Label\n\n7.2 Drug Classes\n\nBreast Feeding; Lactation; Milk, Human; Analgesics, Opioid; Narcotics; Antitussive Agents; Opiates\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides detailed information on hydromorphone’s drug indications, classification, and related data, including its use for moderate to severe pain, off-label cough suppression, and relevant drug classes like opioids and narcotics.
