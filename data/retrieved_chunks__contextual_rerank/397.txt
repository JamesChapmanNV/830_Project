It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance.\n\nIn one study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[7] Because of the structral and chemical similarity of hydromorphone and heroin, it can be assumed that the same interaction between physical tolerance and the environment occurs in hydromorphone use.\n\nDangerous interactions\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains how reduced tolerance after abstinence increases overdose risk, emphasizing the importance of cautious dosing during relapse.
