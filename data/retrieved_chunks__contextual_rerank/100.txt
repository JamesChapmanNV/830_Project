Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.[51][52]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt explains the pharmacological interaction between cocaine and amphetamines, highlighting how they affect dopamine transporters, influence cardiac health through serotonin mechanisms, and alter reward pathways.

However, products on the market today are often not colorless. The following is a table of some common impurities and the colors associated with them.

Being attractive to young women was so imporant to him that much of his time was spent in the company of teenagers.
