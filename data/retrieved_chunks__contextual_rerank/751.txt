As most prosecutions happen at the state level it is important to be familiar with your state and local laws.\n\nINTERNATIONAL LAW #\n\nCanada #\n\nMorphine is schedule I in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules)\n\nPortugal #\n\nEffective July 2001, personal use of morphine without a prescription was decriminalized by Law 30/2000 (see text of law). Possession of less than 2 g is not regarded as a criminal offense, though the substance is liable to be seized and the possessor can be referred to mandatory treatment. Sale, or possession of quantities greater than the personal possession limit, are criminal offenses punishable by jail time.

It was then largely forgotten for the next 40 years. 1 [Details] During his doctorat with the celebrated professor A. W. Hofmann, he discovered the phenylizopropylamine, known today as \"benzendrine\" . He worked in Germany (1910 - 1932), as director of  \"Allgemeine Gesellschaft für Chemiche Industrie\", which, in honor of the Romanian inventor, was named  \"Edeleanu Gesellschaft\" and is still operating in Frankfurt.
