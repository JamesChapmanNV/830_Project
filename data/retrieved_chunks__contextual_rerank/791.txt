NAS symptoms can include irritability, crying, sneezing, stuffy nose, poor sleep, extreme drowsiness (very tired), yawning, poor feeding, sweating, tremors, seizures, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most often, symptoms of NAS appear 2 days after birth and may last more than 2 weeks. The chance that NAS will occur depends on the length of time and/or the dose of opioid taken during pregnancy, if other medications were also taken, if baby was born preterm, and/or size of the baby at birth. If opioids were taken in pregnancy, it is important to let your baby’s healthcare providers know so that they can check for symptoms of NAS and provide the best care for your newborn.Studies have reported a risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) with some opioids; however, not all medications in this class have been studied.

It details NAS symptoms, onset timing, risk factors, and the importance of healthcare monitoring, situating this information within the broader document's focus on hydrocodone's pharmacology, safety, and effects during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
