It highlights the safety and clinical outcomes of neonatal exposure to maternal opioid use, emphasizing the infant's absence of adverse effects and the gradual maternal dose tapering. This information is relevant for understanding opioid transfer through breastmilk and pediatric safety within the broader context of hydromorphone's pharmacology and maternal-fetal safety considerations.\n                "}
