[8] This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria , pain relief , muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\nCodeine itself is a weak ligand for the opioid receptors. However, its main active metabolite, morphine , shows much stronger agonistic effects .\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains the pharmacological mechanism of codeine and its active metabolite morphine, detailing how they interact with μ-opioid receptors to produce effects like euphoria and pain relief. It highlights that while codeine is a weak ligand, its conversion to morphine accounts for its stronger opioid activity, a key aspect of its psychoactive profile discussed elsewhere in the document.\n                "}

Morphine and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13 with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers the production and usage of morphine, highlighting its source from the opium poppy and global manufacturing estimates, as well as its chemical classification as a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid within the morphinan class, providing vital background on its origins, chemical structure, and industrial relevance.\n                "}
