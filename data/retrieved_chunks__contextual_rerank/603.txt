Two reports concern mixed drugs fatalities. In one case, ketamine had only a minor role. For the remaining six cases, insufficient details were available to be evaluated properly. In the three cases involving only ketamine, the routes of administration were intramuscular or intravenous and the cause of death was mainly overdose (multiple intramuscular doses or accidental intravenous overdose), in line with preclinical findings. In the other cases involving ketamine mixed with other drugs, the observed lower ketamine concentrations indicate that drug interaction may have contributed to these deaths. Substances with CNS/respiratory depressant effects, like ethanol, opioids, barbiturates and benzodiazepines, or drugs with cardiostimulant effects, like cocaine or amphetamines, may increase ketamine acute toxicity.
