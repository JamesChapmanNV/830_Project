Hair tests generally take the most recent 1.5 inches of growth and use those for testing. That provides a detection period of approximately 90 days. If an individual's hair is shorter than 1.5 inches, this detection period will be shorter.\n\nFALSE POSITIVES #\n\nSubstances or Conditions which can cause false positives\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses hair testing as a method for detecting MDMA use, noting that it can reveal drug intake over approximately 90 days using the most recent 1.5 inches of hair. It highlights laboratories like Psychemedics and Quest Diagnostics that include MDMA in their standard hair tests and warns of potential false positives caused by certain substances or conditions.

It is a first-generation H1 antihistamine that is widely used as a generic, over-the-counter medication to treat allergies. When exceeding approved doses, diphenhydramine produces powerful deliriant effects.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of diphenhydramine, highlighting its classification as a deliriant and common over-the-counter antihistamine known as DPH or Benadryl. It emphasizes the risks of high-dose use, including dangerous and unpleasant experiences, and advises harm reduction practices. This information is essential for understanding the substance’s effects, risks, and safety considerations within the broader drug profile.\n                "}
