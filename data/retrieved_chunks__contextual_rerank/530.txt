A reader suggests no agitation during cooling, slow stirring until a temperature of 15 degrees C is reached, and a period of 5-10 minutes with slow chilling on ice prior to moving the mixture into the refrigerator. Note that crystals may not be visible, and cloudiness may not indicate crystallization.] 5. Drink and enjoy! The solution will be _very_ bitter, so I mix a little Kool-aid powder into the solution. The taste isn't really bad but it's similar to sucking on a lemon. (One gets used to the taste after a while.:)) 6. Sit back and wait for the effects. Because the codeine is already in solution it only needs to be absorbed, while codeine in the tablet form must dissolve before being absorbed. Because of this, the effects will probably become noticeable within 15min. Note : I don't suggest you evaporate the mixture unless you are willing to wait a\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt is from a detailed guide on extracting codeine from OTC tablets, including steps like dissolving, cooling, filtering, and taste enhancement. It emphasizes proper crystallization techniques and provides user tips for effective extraction.

This is done to act as a deterrent to prevent their recreational use but can easily be circumvented with the use of a cold water extraction.\n\n\n\nCo-codamol contain 500mg of paracetamol per 8mg of codeine. It is available behind the counter in any British pharmacy.\n\n\n\nNurofen plus contain 12.8mg of codeine alongside ibuprofen. It is available behind the counter in any British pharmacy. Due to the higher codeine content than co-codamol, they are better for cold water extraction.\n\n\n\nMany prescription-strength cough syrups contain codeine and promethazine - an antihistamine.
