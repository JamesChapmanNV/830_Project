The indistinct release of neurotransmitters which include adrenaline is known to produce cardiovascular side effects. There are old reports of a cognitive enhancement related to the administration of amphetamine in which improvements in intelligence test scores were reported. In ADHD, amphetamine has been largely showed to produce remarkable improvements in school performance, behavior, and demeanor. The effect was shown to be produced through both racemic forms and to this date, the use of racemic forms 3:1 (D:L) is very common. The therapeutic effect of amphetamine on serotonin does not seem to have a significant clinical effect on ADHD as observed on comparative studies with amphetamine and fenfluramine, a powerful serotonin releasing factor.
