When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of morphine develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. Morphine presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of morphine all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the potential for dependence and abuse associated with morphine, emphasizing its high addictive potential, the development of tolerance over time, and the associated risks of physical and psychological dependence. It underscores the importance of harm reduction practices when using this opioid.\n                "}

Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice[36]. This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected[36]. Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.\n\nLegal status\n\nInternationally, morphine is a Schedule I drug under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.[37] It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[38]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses how grapefruit can influence the metabolism of certain opioids like tramadol, oxycodone, fentanyl, and methadone by inhibiting specific cytochrome P450 enzymes, affecting their toxicity and clearance. It also notes that genetic variations in CYP2D6 impact the effectiveness of medications like codeine and hydrocodone, which rely on this enzyme for activation. The section then shifts to the legal status of morphine internationally, providing context on its regulation and essential medicine designation. This information is relevant for understanding drug interactions and legal considerations associated with opioid use.\n                "}
