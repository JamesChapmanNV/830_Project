People under its influence often report seeing their lives in a whole new light. \"I was completely blown away the first time I did X\" said the same person quoted above. \"I saw some of my problems that I didn't even know I had! All of a sudden, It seemed like the source, nature and sometimes even the solution of all my personal difficulties were completely obvious.\" Surfacing of repressed memories has also been reported. Despite the legal risks surrounding Schedule I drugs, some therapists are still using MDMA in their practices. For a report on the subjective experiences and psychological/behavioral sequelae of 20 psychiatrists who took MDMA, see \"Phenomenology and Sequelae of 3,4 Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine Use\" (Liester, Grob, Bravo, and Walsh) in J. Nervous and Mental Disease, Vol 180, No. 6, June 1992, Serial No. 1315.

Sometimes the opposite effect occurs, causing music to sound alien and unpleasant.\n- Introspection - Some user reports suggest ketamine may enhance introspection; however, this effect appears to be much less consistent and robust than psychedelics and entactogens . It should be noted that there is limited evidence showing ketamine has psychotherapeutic benefits.\n- Memory suppression - Strongly suppresses short and long-term memory (in a dose-dependent manner) for the duration of the experience.
