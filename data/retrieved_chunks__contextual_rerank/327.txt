Following an observed spike of heroin-fentanyl related deaths in Melbourne, Australia, a study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of these cases. All reportable deaths occurring in Victoria during 2015 and submitted to the toxicology laboratory were analysed using LC-MS-MS to confirm the combination of the heroin marker 6-acetylmorphine and/or morphine, and fentanyl. Over 4,000 coronial cases in 2015 underwent toxicological analysis for these drugs, there were nine cases identified that involved fentanyl-laced heroin. ... The ages ranged from 25 to 57 years with an average of 40 and median of 37 years, and consisted of eight males and one female. The average and median femoral blood concentration of fentanyl was 18 and 20 ng/mL (range: <1-45 ng/mL), and morphine 140 and 80 ng/mL (range: 20-400 ng/mL), respectively. All nine cases had 6-acetylmorphine detectable in blood. Urine analysis was also performed where available. ...\n\nPMID:28158759\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details forensic findings from a 2015 spike in heroin-fentanyl related deaths in Melbourne, Australia, highlighting toxicology analysis results, fentanyl blood concentrations, and demographic data.

Due to its powerful opioid properties, fentanyl diversion for misuse is a problem. Fentanyl is added to heroin to increase its potency or is disguised as highly potent heroin. Many users believe that they are purchasing heroin, but it has been adulterated with fentanyl – which often results in overdose deaths.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses fentanyl's potency as a synthetic opioid, highlighting its risks of misuse, diversion, and adulteration in the illicit drug supply.

Recent concerns have arisen around the illicit use of fentanyl and its analogues in a number of European countries, linked to their high potency and associated risk of fatal overdose. Evidence has been emerging from Estonia for over a decade of entrenched patterns of fentanyl use, including injection of the drug and hundreds of overdose deaths. More recently, reports indicate that both fentanyl and 3-methylfentanyl (TMF) have been marketed as a replacement for heroin in European countries (e.g. Bulgaria, Slovakia) affected by heroin shortages. In addition, Germany, Finland and the United Kingdom, reported new outbreaks of fentanyl-related deaths. This combination of increasing mortality data alongside law enforcement intelligence suggesting both diversion and illicit production of fentanyls, prompted wider investigation using a targeted multi-source data collection exercise and analysis.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes recent epidemiological and law enforcement concerns about illicit fentanyl use and overdose outbreaks in Europe, highlighting its high potency, diversion, and increasing mortality rates.
