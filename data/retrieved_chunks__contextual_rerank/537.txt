Being attractive to young women was so imporant to him that much of his time was spent in the company of teenagers. During business hours he would wear a conservative three-piece suit and drive a new sedan, but when he was with his young friends he would wear a leather jacket and drive a motorcycle.

Problematic use is sometimes accompanied by paranoia, an increase in the sense of synchronicity in daily experiences, and egocentrism (the world revolves around the user). With compulsive use, a user may also have impaired judgment with respect to what activities or contexts are appropriate while under the influence (e.g. driving a car, going to a job, or taking a bath), which can increase the risk of accidents. As with any addictive substance, it's a good idea to set hard limits about maximum use and types of use before it becomes a problem.\n\nUrinary Tract Problems:6\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses potential health risks associated with ketamine use, specifically focusing on addictive behaviors and urinary tract problems.
