The FDA has approved these antidote medications for emergency treatment of patients with known or suspected opioid overdose experiencing respiratory and/or central nervous system (CNS) depression. Common routes of naloxone administration include IV, IM, IN, or subcutaneous (SC). Researchers have recently posed a caveat regarding the intranasal route for naloxone administration. Since the incidence of obstructive nasal pathology is relatively high in patients who experience serious OIRD, there is documentation of relevant instances of treatment failures when using the IN formulations.\n\nAlso, an IV neuromuscular blocker may be employed in cases of severe muscular rigidity to assist the controlled respiration treatments.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides information on opioid overdose reversal agents, specifically naloxone and naltrexone, including their approved use, administration routes, and limitations such as potential failure of intranasal delivery due to nasal pathology.
