Neither dihydroxy metabolite altered motor activity. The metabolites 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) did not affect any of the parameters measured. The tachycardia produced by MDMA and HHMA was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Our results demonstrate that HHMA may contribute significantly to the cardiovascular effects of MDMA in vivo. As such, determining the molecular mechanism of action of HHMA and the other hydroxyl metabolites of MDMA warrants further study.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes pharmacological data on MDMA metabolites, highlighting that HHMA induces more potent tachycardia than MDMA itself, and that beta-blockers like propranolol can block these effects. It emphasizes HHMA's potential role in MDMA-associated cardiovascular toxicity, relevant to the detailed metabolism, toxicity, and mechanism sections within the full document.\n                "}

However, products on the market today are often not colorless. The following is a table of some common impurities and the colors associated with them. Note: There is no doubt a segment of the dealers who will add food coloring or some other such color to their drug to make it more appealing, with the philosophy that a brightly-colored product may sell better than an off color product. This is relatively uncommon however.\n\nRED: The product was made from pseudoephedrine, and the red coloring of the tablet was not adequately washed away (it is difficult)\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers related chemistry topics, including precursor compounds like amphetamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylalanine, as well as street-level information such as typical adulterants and impure product coloration. It provides insights into the chemical background and common impurities associated with methamphetamine production and distribution, making it relevant for understanding synthesis precursors, purity assessments, and product appearance.\n                "}
