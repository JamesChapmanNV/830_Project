However, it has a rapid onset and short duration of action relative to other opioids, which can lead to compulsive redosing. Additionally, many users report noticeably less euphoria with fentanyl and its analogs. As a result, it is generally considered to have lower recreational value.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the various pharmaceutical and street forms of fentanyl, highlighting its prevalence and associated overdose risks in the US. It also summarizes fentanyl's subjective effects, comparing its rapid onset, short duration, and relatively lower recreational euphoria to other opioids, which is essential for understanding its dangers and user experience.\n                "}
