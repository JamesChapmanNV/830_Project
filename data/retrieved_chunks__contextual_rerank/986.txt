A small amount of ingested codeine is converted to morphine in the body. Codeine increases tolerance to pain, reducing existing discomfort. In addition to decreasing pain, codeine also causes sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression. **Antitussive activity** This drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. **Effects on intestinal motility** Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action. This may possibly lead to constipation. The chronic use of opioids, including codeine sulfate, may lead to obstructive bowel disease, particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility. **Effects on\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action of codeine, including its analgesic, antitussive, sedation, and gastrointestinal impact, aligned with detailed scientific data found in the full PubChem chemical profile.

Because of this, the effects will probably become noticeable within 15min. Note : I don't suggest you evaporate the mixture unless you are willing to wait a while. The Merck index warns that codeine is sensitive to heat and light. For that reason if you wish to evaporate the mixture, do it without heat, and shield the solution from light. In order to take full advantage of codeine, it is helpful to be familiar with some relevant pharmacology: *CYP2D6 The body converts codeine into morphine (~10%) by using the so called P450 cytochrome pathway, especially cytochrome 2d6 (cyp2d6). Unfortunately, cyp2d6 is missing in about 7% of the white population, and its manifestation is quite variable in the rest. Individuals who inherited a cyp2d6 deficiency will get many of the adverse effects associated with codeine but little euphoria. If codeine just doesn't work for you, this may be why. Some drugs also interfere with cyp2d6. Prime among these are the\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the recommended handling of codeine solutions, including cautions against evaporation and advice on protecting the compound from heat and light, referencing the sensitivity of codeine as noted by the Merck index.
