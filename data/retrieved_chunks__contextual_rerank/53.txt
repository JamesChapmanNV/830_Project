Safety and Neurotoxicity Discussion\n\nBehavioral Safety Concerns\n\nAs noted, a primary psychological effect of MDMA is to make the user feel \"safe\", at peace with the world, pleasantly reconciled to things as they are, and things however they will be. This can remarkably diminish one's ability to make sound judgements during the session. Examples:\n\nIt becomes easy to want to prolong the MDMA state by taking more and more of the drug (or of other drugs), beyond what you would judge wise or worthwhile when not under its influence.\n\nIt becomes easier to have unsafe sex. You may \"forget,\" judge that the risk of infection is very small, or feel that infection wouldn't be such a terrible thing after all. If you think you might have sex while on MDMA, it may help you and your partner to stay safe if you lay out safer sex supplies before dosing in a place you'll be sure to see them later, and agree beforehand that you'll use them if the occasion arises.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk provides an important overview of safety and neurotoxicity considerations related to MDMA use, emphasizing behavioral safety concerns such as impaired judgment, risk of unsafe sex, and the potential neurological and psychological effects discussed in the overall document.\n                "}

It is strongly advised to employ strategies to limit intake and prevent abuse. Conceptual thinking - Ketamine produces conceptual or non-linear thinking in a manner that can stimulate one's artistic or creative faculties. Users commonly report entering dream-like, highly complex, and abstract mental spaces that frees them from the boundaries of normal cognition and promotes new insight into their lives and mental patterns. Déjà vu - The user may experience a powerful sensation of déjà vu. This effect is uncommon but less-so than with other substances. Delusion - Delusions appear to occur more commonly on ketamine than other substances (e.g. stimulants , psychedelics ). This effect often coincides with its ego inflation component. It is strongly advised to avoid ketamine if you are susceptible to mental disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder as it may exacerbate delusions and trigger psychosis.

The best dose to start at is the 30 mg - 60 mg dosage. That way you won't experience many adverse effects and you can continue to take this small amount until you feel the desired effects, after that you can increase the dosage as you please. Most people settle around the 250 mg mark for the best euphoria, with the least side effects. The best idea is to take in a situation where you won't become distracted. You can get yourself into a comfortable position and relax because you will become _quite_ relaxed. It may take 5 to 20 times before you can appreciate the effects. The effects are subtle like marijuana and it takes some time before you come to recognize them all. The LD50 (lethal dose for %50) is 800 mg in the average person. Death from codeine, unlike most opiates, includes restlessness, seizures and eventually death from respiratory arrest. Some sources indicate that the lower-end LD50 may be around 500 mg, so doses above 450\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This extracted section discusses recommended initial dosing (30-60 mg) of codeine, effects, and safety considerations, including typical euphoria levels around 250 mg, relaxation, onset time, and the lethal dose estimate (800 mg) with risks of respiratory arrest and seizures at high doses.
