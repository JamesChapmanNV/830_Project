Most users consider this to be a waste of their tripping experience, especially as it can make them sick to their stomachs. While fatalities caused by the direct pharmacological effects of ketamine are nearly unheard of at normal recreational doses, ketamine is a powerful anaesthetic and being anaesthetized, semi-conscious, or unconscious carries distinct risks. Body positions that restrict breathing or blood-flow (e.g. \"child's pose\" or face down into a pillow) can result in serious injury or death even if the person is conscious. Extreme care should be taken before combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, opiates, barbiturates, and/or benzodiazepines. This can be very dangerous. While most (if not all) of these combinations have been used without negative incident, this does NOT mean that they should be considered safe. Opiates/opioids such as heroin are\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the ketamine FAQ discusses the risks and dangers of overdose, highlighting that while fatalities from direct effects are rare, severe injury or death can occur if body positions restrict breathing or blood flow. It emphasizes extreme caution when combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, or opioids, and underscores the importance of understanding these risks within the broader context of safe recreational use and health concerns detailed in the full document.\n                "}

Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course because of the nature of absorption. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous. It is also potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk from the “Toxicity and harm potential” section highlights the dangers of non-medical fentanyl use, emphasizing the high risk of overdose and the challenges in dosing safely due to its extreme potency.

The terrorists threatened to kill everyone inside unless Russia ended the war in Chechnya. Although the Chechen militants agreed to release some of the hostages during the first couple of days, negotiations with the Russian authorities eventually stalled. Just before dawn on October 26, Russian special police units resorted to using an incapacitating gas based on the drug fentanyl to end the crisis. All of the Chechen militants were killed, and most of the civilian captives survived. But while the operation was largely a success, at least 117 of the hostages died from the effects of the gas. /Incapacitating gas based on the drug fentanyl/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a historical incident involving the use of fentanyl-based incapacitating gas during the 2002 Moscow theater crisis, highlighting fentanyl's role in mass casualty events and its serious toxicological effects.
