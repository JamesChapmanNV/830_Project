Problematic use is sometimes accompanied by paranoia, an increase in the sense of synchronicity in daily experiences, and egocentrism (the world revolves around the user). With compulsive use, a user may also have impaired judgment with respect to what activities or contexts are appropriate while under the influence (e.g. driving a car, going to a job, or taking a bath), which can increase the risk of accidents. As with any addictive substance, it's a good idea to set hard limits about maximum use and types of use before it becomes a problem.\n\nUrinary Tract Problems:6\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses potential health risks associated with ketamine use, specifically focusing on addictive behaviors and urinary tract problems.

Liquid LSD is used in the creation of blotter tabs. A single drop of potent liquid LSD could be 50 times a normal dose, although it is generally diluted to the point where a single drop is equal to approximately one dose. This varies greatly from batch to batch, and is sometimes a weak dose while othertimes a very strong dose. Liquid LSD is somewhat uncommon. Be extremely careful when dealing with it as there is no way for the average person to gauge its potency. It is frequently stored in small dropper bottles. Caution: when one reaches the end of the bottle, one should not rinse it out and assume that what remains is a small dose. There can still be many doses left along the inside surfaces and taking them all at once can lead to some unexpectedly strong and possibly very uncomfortable experiences.\n\nGelatin\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed information on LSD in liquid form, highlighting its solubility, common dilution methods, dosage variability, and associated safety precautions.
