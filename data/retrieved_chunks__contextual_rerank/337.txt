From: dmurphy3@aol.com (DMurphy3) This may be so (in fact I read the same article), but typically a water quench leads to the alcohol, which is what we were trying to get rid of to start with. Also, if one were using Na rather than Li (Na is the Birch, I too forget the Li named reduction), adding water to quench will *definitely* be exciting, particularly considering the flammability of THF or ether. Apparently they were following the guys handwritten notes. It would have been even more interesting had they used the real Birch method, using Na, especially when they tried the water quench ;>) From: eleusis@netcom.com (Eleusis) Yep - apparently that would be the case. As well, any extra Li (or Na if doing the straight Birch method) would convert to the Hydroxide, which might fuck the product up a bit. I bet you they *did* do that the first time, and then, after they replaced that wing of the lab, they decided not to \"publish\" those results ;-).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the technical considerations and potential issues encountered during a Birch reduction synthesis of methamphetamine, specifically highlighting the effects of water quenching with sodium or lithium metal. It emphasizes the risks of side reactions, such as forming alcohols, and suggests that original handwritten notes may have led to suboptimal procedures, providing insights relevant for understanding clandestine synthesis methods within the broader chemistry and synthesis sections of the document.\n                "}

The Procedure 1. Obtain a quantity of tablets containing codeine, check to see if they contain anything other than codeine, caffeine, acetaminophen or aspirin. If they do, and you don't know whether or not it will be a problem, your best bet is not to use them. Measure out your desired amount of codeine (ex. 64 mg = 8 tablets * 8 mg/tablet). You may want to add 2 extra tablets as it is quite likely you will lose some codeine in the procedure. As you get more experience with the procedure you will be able to get approx. 95% of the codeine extracted. 2. Measure out some nice hot water, use approx. 40 ml / 20 tablets or more if needed. I would suggest you don't go over 50 ml for 20 tablets. I don't know if the use of boiling water would destroy any of the codeine but your best bet is not to use it. Use hot water but not boiling. Make sure the tablets dissolve completely.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a step-by-step procedure for extracting codeine from OTC tablets, emphasizing measuring a desired dose, using hot water (not boiling), and filtering the solution.
