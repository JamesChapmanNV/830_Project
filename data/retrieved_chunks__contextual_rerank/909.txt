This could include confronting past episode of abuse, re-experiencing painful memories, encountering emotional crises, or unearthing previously unrecognized feelings either alone or while in conversation with friends and loved ones. In these situations, therapists suggest one should try to remain calm and avoid fighting the feelings. Find a supportive friend and a safe, comfortable space to sit while working through the feelings. If at all possible, try to find support among friends as emergency rooms are poorly equipped to handle emotional crises.
