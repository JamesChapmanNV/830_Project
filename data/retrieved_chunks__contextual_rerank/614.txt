To reduce damage, it is recommended to grind the substance completely before use and alternate nostrils. [49] Additionally, a default saline nasal spray application helps wash out acidic/caustic substances from the affected area. Also, sharing snorting equipment (nasal spray bottles, straws, banknotes, bullets, etc) has been linked to the transmission of hepatitis C. (Bonkovsky and Mehta) In one study, the University of Tennessee Medical Center researches warned that other blood-borne diseases such as HIV, the AIDS-causing virus, could be transmitted as well. [50] Drinking makes it harder to resist pressure and clouds your ability to make safe choices. Not only might you miss signs of danger, like blood stains on shared equipment, but alcohol weakens your immune system, making it easier to catch and spread viruses.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides harm reduction advice related to nasal administration of ketamine, emphasizing safe practices to prevent nasal damage, infection transmission, and associated blood-borne diseases like hepatitis C and HIV.

I had been desperately sad and searching for meaning, for a God I did not believe existed. Sitting with my physical eyes closed, my inner eye moved through a beautiful, spiraling tunnel. The walls of the tunnel seemed like a living mother of pearl, and it felt like a spiritual rebirth canal. I was in the darkness, spiraling towards the light.
