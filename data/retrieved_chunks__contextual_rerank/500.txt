If you experience any of these symptoms, sit down, rest, and drink some fruit juice, water, or a gatorade-type sports drink. In the unlikely event someone has a more severe reaction, e.g. loss of consciousness or seizures, get medical help as soon as possible.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt appears within the safety and overdose section of the MDMA FAQ, providing guidance on recognizing and responding to MDMA overdose symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, faintness, muscle cramps, and panic.
