If codeine just doesn't work for you, this may be why. Some drugs also interfere with cyp2d6. Prime among these are the SSRIs, with the exception of Zoloft (if I remember correctly). The most potent inhibitor is paroxetine (paxil), followed by fluoxetine (prozac). If you are taking an SSRI, you will probably experience a markedly decreased euphoria when using codeine. (Paxil has a half life of only 24hrs, so not taking it for a few days will do miracles; the half life of prozac is 7 days.) Finally, codeine itself is a cyp2d6 inhibitor. This means that taking the whole dose as quickly as possible will probably give you the biggest high (ie. its a waste to redose in 30 mins). *GLUTHETHIMIDE A combination of codeine and gluthethimide (a sleeping agent) has been used in some places as a heroin substitute. Gluthethimide is an enzyme-inducer, and it allows the body to convert more than 10% of codeine into morphine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt explains factors affecting codeine's effectiveness and euphoria, highlighting how certain drugs like SSRIs (especially paroxetine and fluoxetine) can interfere with CYP2D6 enzymatic conversion of codeine to morphine, reducing its psychoactive effects. It also mentions that codeine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor and describes the use of gluthethimide combined with codeine to enhance morphine conversion, relevant to sections on pharmacology and drug interactions within the full document.\n                "}
