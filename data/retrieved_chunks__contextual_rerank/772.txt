This of course will result in a positive result in a drug test for the opiates. It is not known whether or not the drugs heroin, morphine or codeine can be separately determined on a drug test. In other words it isn't likely that the drug tester can determine which of the three above drugs you have taken, he just knows you've taken one or more of them. Note! Addiction to codeine can occur. Tolerance is also seen with chronic use. Although the withdrawal is minimal with codeine, it is not a fun time. Please be cautious in your use of the drug. Some common side effects from codeine include drowsiness, light-headedness, dry mouth, urinary retention (difficulty in urination), constipation and of course, euphoria. Adverse effects can include itchiness (common), confusion, nausea and vomiting. The nausea experienced with codeine is less common and less intense than that experienced with the stronger opiates\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the pharmacology and side effects of codeine, emphasizing its metabolism to morphine, drug testing considerations, and potential for addiction, tolerance, and adverse effects like drowsiness, nausea, and constipation, providing critical safety information within the comprehensive guide on codeine use and extraction techniques.\n                "}
