For some users, an enhanced comprehension of subtle details in the music or a feeling of deeper understanding with regards to composition and lyrics has been reported what is essentially less common compared to many other hallucinogenic compounds. The overall effect is, for the most part mainly indicative of an all-around increased enthusiasm towards hearing music in general. Rarely, one may find music to be annoying or distracting rather than enhanced - this seems to be largely set and setting based and happens rarely.\n- Mindfulness\n- Motivation enhancement\n- Reinvigoration\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the cognitive and sensory effects of MDMA, specifically highlighting how it enhances music appreciation by increasing emotional impact and subjective understanding of music.
