Two-month-old male Wistar rats received single morphine doses alone (0.45 and 0.9 mg/kg) or with midazolam (0.3 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.15 and 0.45 mg/kg), levomepromazine (0.35 mg/kg), metoclopramide (1.0 mg/kg), and hyoscine butylbromide (1.7 mg/kg) as single subcutaneous injections. Analgesia was measured by the tail-flick test after 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min of drug administration. In the case of significant analgesia enhancement, analgesic and sedative effects were explored in 3-, 5-, 6-, 8-, and 11-month-old rats. Significant morphine (0.9 mg/kg) analgesia enhancement was observed 60 min after haloperidol (0.15 and 0.45 mg/kg) and hyoscine butylbromide co-administration.
