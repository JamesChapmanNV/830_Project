If codeine just doesn't work for you, this may be why. Some drugs also interfere with cyp2d6. Prime among these are the SSRIs, with the exception of Zoloft (if I remember correctly). The most potent inhibitor is paroxetine (paxil), followed by fluoxetine (prozac). If you are taking an SSRI, you will probably experience a markedly decreased euphoria when using codeine. (Paxil has a half life of only 24hrs, so not taking it for a few days will do miracles; the half life of prozac is 7 days.) Finally, codeine itself is a cyp2d6 inhibitor. This means that taking the whole dose as quickly as possible will probably give you the biggest high (ie. its a waste to redose in 30 mins). *GLUTHETHIMIDE A combination of codeine and gluthethimide (a sleeping agent) has been used in some places as a heroin substitute. Gluthethimide is an enzyme-inducer, and it allows the body to convert more than 10% of codeine into morphine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt explains factors affecting codeine's effectiveness and euphoria, highlighting how certain drugs like SSRIs (especially paroxetine and fluoxetine) can interfere with CYP2D6 enzymatic conversion of codeine to morphine, reducing its psychoactive effects. It also mentions that codeine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor and describes the use of gluthethimide combined with codeine to enhance morphine conversion, relevant to sections on pharmacology and drug interactions within the full document.\n                "}

It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance.\n\nIn one study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[7] Because of the structral and chemical similarity of hydromorphone and heroin, it can be assumed that the same interaction between physical tolerance and the environment occurs in hydromorphone use.\n\nDangerous interactions\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains how reduced tolerance after abstinence increases overdose risk, emphasizing the importance of cautious dosing during relapse.

This analysis unveiled histories of poly-drug use in seven of the cases under investigation. Moreover, the concentrations of morphine and codeine in the brain were also investigated, and the results were compared with the data obtained from the blood specimens. The concentration of morphine in blood ranged from 33 to 688 ng/mL, while the concentration of codeine ranged from 0 to 193 ng/mL. However, in the brain, the concentration of morphine was found to be between 85 and 396 ng/g, while the levels of codeine ranged from 11 to 160 ng/g.
