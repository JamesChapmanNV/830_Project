Hydrocodone should also be used with caution in patients with head injury, other intracranial lesions, or preexisting increased intracranial pressure, since opiate agonists may increase CSF pressure and markedly exaggerate these conditions; in addition, adverse CNS effects of the drug may obscure the clinical course of the underlying condition. The drug should also be used with caution in patients who have undergone thoracotomies or lapaRotomies, since suppression of the cough reflex may lead to retention of secretions postoperatively in these patients.\n\nAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2015; Drug Information 2015.
