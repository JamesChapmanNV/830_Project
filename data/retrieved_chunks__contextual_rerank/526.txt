Because of their extreme potency, methods to safely and rapidly detect these compounds are of high interest. This work investigates the use of thermal desorption direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (TD-DART-MS) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as tools for the rapid and sensitive (nanogram to picograms) detection of fentanyl, 16 fentanyl analogues, and five additional opioids. Competitive ionization studies highlight that detection of these compounds in the presence of heroin is readily achievable, down to 0.1% fentanyl by mass with TD-DART-MS. With IMS, detection of nanogram levels of fentanyl in a binary fentanyl and heroin mixture is possible but can be complicated by decreased resolution in certain commercial instrument models. Modifications to the alarm windows can be used to ensure detection of fentanyl in binary\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses recent advancements in detection methods for fentanyl and its analogues, emphasizing their emerging threat and the importance of rapid identification techniques. It details the use of thermal desorption direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (TD-DART-MS) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) for sensitive detection in forensic and law enforcement contexts.

It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance.\n\nIn one study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[7] Because of the structral and chemical similarity of hydromorphone and heroin, it can be assumed that the same interaction between physical tolerance and the environment occurs in hydromorphone use.\n\nDangerous interactions\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains how reduced tolerance after abstinence increases overdose risk, emphasizing the importance of cautious dosing during relapse.
