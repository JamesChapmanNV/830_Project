Those studies have found an increased chance of developmental delay, trouble with memory, and autism-like features. However, it is hard to know if this is due to the medication exposure or other factors that can increase the chances of these problems.\n\n◈ What if I have been taking more codeine than recommended by my healthcare provider or have an opioid use disorder?\n\nTalk with your healthcare provider about your codeine use. People who are pregnant and take opioids in higher doses or for longer than recommended by their healthcare providers have an increased chance for issues such as poor fetal growth, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and the need for a C-section.\n\n◈ Codeine and breastfeeding:\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This segment provides key information on potential long-term effects of prenatal opiate exposure, guidance for pregnant individuals taking higher-than-recommended doses, and considerations for breastfeeding with codeine use.

NAS symptoms with opioids can include trouble breathing, extreme drowsiness (sleepiness), poor feeding, irritability, sweating, tremors, vomiting and diarrhea. Most often, symptoms of NAS appear two days after birth and may last more than two weeks. The chance that NAS will occur depends on the length of time and/or the dose of opioid taken during pregnancy. If opioids were taken in pregnancy, it is important to let your baby’s healthcare providers know so that they can check for symptoms of NAS and provide the best care for your newborn.\n\n◈ Does taking codeine in pregnancy affect future behavior or learning for the child?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses the potential effects of maternal codeine use during pregnancy on newborns, specifically regarding withdrawal symptoms (Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome) and long-term behavioral or learning impacts. It provides critical information for understanding fetal and neonatal risks associated with opioid exposure, relevant to sections on pregnancy, toxicity, and safety. Its detailed explanations on NAS symptoms and developmental concerns are key for clinicians and researchers seeking comprehensive maternal-infant safety data.\n                "}

When used recreationally they are commonly known as lean or purple drank.\n\nToxicity and harm potential\n\nCodeine has a low toxicity relative to dose. As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy and memory loss. Some people may also have an allergic reaction to codeine, such as the swelling of skin and rashes.[10] It is also potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.\n\nTolerance and addiction potential\n\nAs with other opioids, the chronic use of codeine can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the toxicity, harm potential, and addiction risks associated with codeine, highlighting its low toxicity relative to dosage, potential allergic reactions, and dangers when combined with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines. It emphasizes harm reduction practices and explains the drug's moderate addictive potential and likelihood of psychological dependence with chronic use. This information is crucial for understanding the safety concerns and dependency risks outlined in the broader opioid profile.\n                "}
