[ citation needed ] Novelty enhancement - Very prominent on LSD compared to other substances. Focus enhancement - Occurs mostly on low or threshold dosages and feels less forced or sharp than it does with stimulants . Immersion enhancement - Very prominent on LSD compared to other substances, second only to dissociative immersion enhancement. Personal meaning enhancement - The user may feel as if their experience has special meaning, which may or may not last after the trip. Appears to depend on the user's set and setting . Emotion enhancement - The user's ability to experience emotion may be strongly enhanced. This is thought to contribute to its therapeutic effect. Consequently, it is advised to not take LSD when in a low or unstable mood and to follow the principles of set and setting . Empathy, affection and sociability enhancement - Can be prominent but also unreliable compared to MDMA.

Some users have reported the experience of being able to \"hear colors\" or \"see sounds\" in the k-hole state. However, it is not clear if ketamine is capable of producing synaesthesia as a normal effect or if it is merely eliciting it in predisposed individuals. More research is needed to understand the etiology of this reported effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details ketamine's auditory and multisensory effects, including auditory suppression, distortion, hallucinations, and the potential for synaesthesia, primarily at higher doses. It is part of the broader sensory and subjective effects overview, highlighting how ketamine alters perception across multiple sensory modalities. These effects are important for understanding ketamine's dissociative and perceptual impact.\n                "}
