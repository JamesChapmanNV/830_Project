Another case report described constriction in the blood vessels of the placenta (placental vasoconstriction) in a person using morphine for chronic pain control in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy.Studies involving people who often use some opioids during their pregnancy have found an increased chance for adverse outcomes including poor growth of the baby, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and the need for C-section.
