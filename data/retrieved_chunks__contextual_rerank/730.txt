At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit or lay down and feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and can eventually become powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness regardless of where they are or what they are doing at that moment.\n- Respiratory depression\n- Muscle relaxation\n- Dizziness\n- Motor control loss - This effect is pronounced and comparable to the motor control loss experienced on a heavy dose of alcohol. This typically results in users stumbling and an inability to walk in a straight line. As this may easily result in injury, one should avoid walking and using stairs while on zopiclone.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the physical effects of zopiclone, including sedation, respiratory depression, muscle relaxation, dizziness, and significant motor control loss, highlighting the risks of overdose and impaired coordination.
