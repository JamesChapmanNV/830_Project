When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of morphine develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. Morphine presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of morphine all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the potential for dependence and abuse associated with morphine, emphasizing its high addictive potential, the development of tolerance over time, and the associated risks of physical and psychological dependence. It underscores the importance of harm reduction practices when using this opioid.\n                "}
