Edgewood Arsenal provided MDA to Dr. Cattell as part of a research program exploring the possible use of MDA as one of several interrogation tools. Cattell later reported We didn't know whether it was dog piss or what it was we were giving him. Blauer's wife won $18,000 in damages in a legal suit against the state in 1955, but the army successfully hid its involvement.  In 1987, Blauer's daughters win a law suit against the federal government for $700,000 over it's role in their father's death. After Blauer's death, Edgewood terminated its investigation into MDA.
