When the dose was increased to 40 mg daily, she developed galactorrhea. Her serum prolactin levels were elevated on 3 occasions over the next year, but all other examinations were normal. Galactorrhea and amenorrhea persisted for at least 2 years with continuous methadone use. The authors of the article stated that 3 cases of hyperprolactinemia had been reported to the United Kingdom's drug regulatory agency. Causality was not proven in any of these cases.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a case report of methadone-associated hyperprolactinemia, specifically galactorrhea and amenorrhea in a non-breastfeeding woman prescribed at 30-40 mg daily. It highlights the potential endocrine side effect of elevated serum prolactin levels linked to methadone use without proven causality, consistent with the document’s extensive coverage of methadone's safety, hormonal effects, and adverse reactions.\n                "}
