He felt a panic he had never known before; he thought that he was losing his mind and going \"out of control.\" His friends were so concerned that they took him to a small hospital, where he was given chlorpromazine and after six hours released in their care. The next day he had a flashback that lasted one or two hours and was almost as frightening as the original experience. Flashbacks continued for six months, their frequency, duration, and severity eventually diminishing to the point where it was difficult for him to determine whether they were related to the LSD trip or merely an intensification of his usual anxiety. In fact, the patient described the flashbacks as being like very much enhanced anxiety episodes. Even several years after this experience, when he became very anxious, he was reminded of the trip and these flashbacks. He denied that these\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a case of LSD-induced panic, hospitalization, and a prolonged six-month period of frightening flashbacks that were later linked to underlying anxiety.

Actually, any impurities which may be present as a result of synthetic procedures will almost certainly be without any effect on the trip. If there are 200 micrograms of LSD in a tablet, there could only be 200 mics of impurities present even if the LSD was originally only 50% pure (assuming nothing else has been added), and few compounds will produce a significant effect until a hundred to a thousand times this amount has been ingested. Even mescaline, which has a rather specific psychedelic effect, requires about a thousand thimes this amount.\"\n\nNote that:\n\non a piece of paper, vs. a tablet, you can't even add significant amounts of adulterants\n\nadulterants would cost, whereas blank paper will rip someone off just as well.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from _Psychedelic Chemistry_ discusses the misconception that impurities significantly affect LSD's psychoactivity, emphasizing that impurities are unlikely to have a meaningful impact unless present in much higher doses.
