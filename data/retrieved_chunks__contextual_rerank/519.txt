(Ed.); Poisoning & Drug Overdose. 4th ed. Lange Medical Books/McGraw-Hill. New York, N.Y. 2004., p. 249\n\nMost patients who ingest psilocybin containing mushrooms do not present to a hospital and usually suffer no ill effects. For those who do go to a hospital, dysphoria is the major complaint, and a quiet, supportive environment (darkened room with familiar faces) and calm reassurance are all that are usually necessary. There are no specific antidotes for hallucinogenic mushrooms. Diazepam (oral or IV) may be needed for sedation, and chlorpromazine should be reserved for frank hallucinations.\n\nDart, R.C. (ed).
