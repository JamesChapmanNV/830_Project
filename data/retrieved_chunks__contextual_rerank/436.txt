Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence, the harmful or toxic aspects of opioid usage are exclusively associated with not taking the necessary precautions in regards to its administration, overdosing and using impure products.\n\nFentanyl is very potent and around 1000 times more permeable than morphine.[21] Even though fentanyl uptake through skin is rather slow[22], unintentionally transporting the substance from the skin by touching the mouth, nose or eyes is dangerous.\n\nHeavy dosages of fentanyl can result in respiratory depression, leading onto fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk discusses the long-term health risks and dangers associated with fentanyl use, emphasizing its high potency, permeability, and the critical importance of safe administration to prevent overdose and poisoning. It highlights that, when used appropriately, long-term complications are limited to dependence and constipation, but improper handling and dosing can lead to severe respiratory depression and fatal outcomes. This information is crucial for understanding fentanyl’s toxicity and harm reduction considerations within the broader context of its pharmacology and risks.\n                "}
