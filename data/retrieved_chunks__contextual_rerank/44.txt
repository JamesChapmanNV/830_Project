However, it is also not uncommon for people with general social prejudices against dance behavior to suddenly become much more openminded to the idea once under the influence of a sufficient (moderate) dose of MDMA. Tactile enhancement - MDMA produces distinct enhancements to tactile sensations. Users commonly report a sense of softness and fuzziness draping over their skin. Likewise, touching soft and fuzzy objects such as shag rugs can become irresistibly pleasurable and satisfying. MDMA-type tactile enhancement appears to be an effect unique to the entactogen class and may be a serotonin-related effect. Although it is also worth noting that many experimenters of the drug find that the tactile effects (especially in regards to pleasure) have often been notably exaggerated by other users, with some of these\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses MDMA's stimulating effects on physical activity and its distinctive tactile enhancements, highlighting increased enjoyment of touch and potential changes in social behavior related to dance.
