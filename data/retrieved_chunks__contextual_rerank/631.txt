If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness during maternal morphine use, a physician should be contacted immediately. Some evidence suggests that IV ketorolac, oral ibuprofen and acetaminophen as part of a multimodal post-cesarean section analgesia reduces percentage of mothers who fail exclusive breastfeeding compared to patient-controlled IV morphine-based analgesia.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed guidance on postpartum pain management with morphine, emphasizing limited maternal opioid use (2-3 days) and close infant monitoring to prevent adverse effects such as excessive sleepiness or breathing issues.
