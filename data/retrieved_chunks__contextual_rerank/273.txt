RESULTS: The prevalence of drug findings above the cut-off concentrations in blood was 1.3% for amphetamine, 1.0% for methamphetamine, 0.6% for cocaine and 1.3% for THC. The cut-off concentrations in oral fluid that gave the highest diagnostic accuracy were for amphetamine 130ng/mL (accuracy 99.8%), methamphetamine 280ng/mL (accuracy 99.9%), cocaine 570ng/mL (accuracy 99.6%), and THC 38ng/mL (accuracy 98.3%). The proportion of false positives were 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.9%; and the proportion of false negatives were 0.1%, 0.0%, 0.3% and 0.8%, respectively, when using those cut-offs. The positive predictive values were 87.9%, 92.9%, 84.6% and 35.7% for amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine and THC, respectively.

It presents findings on prevalence rates, optimal cut-off concentrations, false positive/negative rates, and predictive values, highlighting limitations in using oral fluid tests to reliably identify blood-level drug concentrations.

The infant's serum methamphetamine concentration on autopsy was 39 mcg/L.
