It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[9]\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nWarning: Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the increased risks of overdose following relapse due to reduced tolerance and highlights how environmental factors can influence opioid tolerance. It also provides a warning about dangerous drug interactions that can turn otherwise safe substances into life-threatening combinations, emphasizing the importance of harm reduction when using opioids like oxycodone.\n                "}
