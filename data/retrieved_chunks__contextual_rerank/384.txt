These outcomes might be more likely if a person takes methadone in greater amounts than recommended by their healthcare provider, or if someone is using methadone but not under the care of a healthcare provider.People who take opioids in higher doses or for longer than recommended by their healthcare provider also have a higher chance of poor growth of the baby, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and C-section.\n\n◈ Will my baby have withdrawal (neonatal abstinence syndrome) if I continue to take methadone?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses pregnancy-related health outcomes associated with methadone use during pregnancy, including risks of preterm delivery, low birth weight, growth issues, and stillbirth, highlighting higher doses and lack of medical oversight as factors.
