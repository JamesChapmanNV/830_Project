One ketamine user recommends that people set a limit on use *before* ever trying it so they can have a benchmark against which to judge usage levels. Write down the limits. What do you think a reasonable maximum usage would be: once per month? once per week? twice per day? Check in regularly with pre-K usage limits and (if possible) have someone who can be confided in about use and who can act as an external sanity check. While not common, it is not unusual for people to fall into patterns of use much higher than they expected. John Lilly is a classic example of a person who ended up using A LOT of ketamine, but there are many others. Using once per day or more may also cause long-term problems. We have received at least one report of a person who used ketamine once to twice per day for six months, and a year and a half later felt that he had done permanent damage to himself, experiencing persistent flashes and streaks in his vision. Mostly the dangers are\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt addresses concerns about ketamine habituation and long-term health effects, emphasizing the importance of setting usage limits and monitoring patterns to prevent dependence and damage. It highlights recommendations for establishing personal boundaries, the risks of excessive use, and the potential for lasting visual disturbances after frequent, intense consumption. This information is relevant within the broader discussion of ketamine's health risks and safe use practices.\n                "}

Some researchers such as Krebs and Johansen (2015[38]) attribute at least some of the cases to be related to Somatic Symptom Disorder, when people fixate on normal somatic experiences and perceptions that they weren't aware of before consuming the drug. Other researchers relate it to an associative reaction to a contextual cue akin to what people that have faced trauma or strongly emotional experiences face when receiving a triggering stimulus (Holland and Passie 2011[39]). There is no consensus on what are the risk factors but some researchers theorize that pre-existing psychopathologies may be a significant contributor (Abraham and Duffy 1996[40])\n\nThe prevalence of HPPD is difficult to estimate but appears to be very rare (Halpern et al 2016[41]), with estimates ranging from 1 in 20 users for the transitory and less serious type 1 HPPD, to 1 in 50.000 users for the more concerning type 2 HPPD.[42]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the phenomenon of \"flashbacks\" and Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) associated with LSD use.

This has resulted in many people disregarding the psychedelic aspects of MDMA as a myth, rumor or negligible effect despite a large body of anecdotal reports suggesting otherwise. The (often mild) hallucinatory effects cannot be guaranteed to manifest themselves, but are the most likely to occur with chemically pure MDMA at high doses, as well as towards the end of the experience; particularly if the user has been smoking cannabis. The visuals during the offset are usually characterized by closed eye visuals (CEVs) such as typical psychedelic-like pattering. Whereas during the peak effects, the visuals tend to be more similar to the open eye distortions of standard psychedelics, albeit in much more mildly and less vivid form. They also seem more likely to occur if the user has prior experience with psychedelics.\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the visual effects of MDMA, noting their inconsistent and mild nature compared to classic psychedelics, with visual hallucinations more likely at high doses or towards the experience's end, especially if combined with cannabis. It emphasizes the variability and contextual factors influencing MDMA's visual phenomena, which are key to understanding its subjective sensory effects within harm reduction and user experience discussions.\n                "}
