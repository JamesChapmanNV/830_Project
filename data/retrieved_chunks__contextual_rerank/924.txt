Can it make it harder for me to become pregnant?\n\nIt is not known if lorazepam can make it harder to become pregnant.\n\n◈ Does taking lorazepam increase the chance of miscarriage?\n\nMiscarriage is common and can occur in any pregnancy for many different reasons. There is one study looking at the class of benzodiazepine medication, including lorazepam. This study suggested an increased chance for miscarriage between 6 and 20 weeks of pregnancy when a benzodiazepine medication was used in pregnancy. Because the data is limited to this one study, it is not known if lorazepam could increase the chance for miscarriage.\n\n◈ Does taking lorazepam increase the chance of birth defects?\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk addresses pregnancy-related questions and reproductive safety of lorazepam, providing information on its potential effects on fertility, miscarriage risk, and birth defects.

The nausea experienced with codeine is less common and less intense than that experienced with the stronger opiates such as morphine. A tip to all those using opiates, lying down does wonders to the nausea. If you ever experience nausea on opiates it is different than the commonly experienced nausea as it is more of a light-headed nausea. Lying down will almost always relieve the nausea in a couple minutes, which after you can attempt to stand up again. Codeine is a _excellent_ opiate to start experimenting with. Although the euphoria is not as intense as that experienced with the stronger opiates, the euphoria can still be quite intense. It also must be noted that like most other drugs, some experience is required before the full effects can be noticed and enjoyed. The best dose to start at is the 30 mg - 60 mg dosage. That way you won't experience many adverse effects and you can continue to take this\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt from the Erowid drug information webpage provides details on the adverse effects, dosage recommendations, and practical tips for safe use of codeine, highlighting its relatively mild side effects, euphoria potential, and initial dosage guidance between 30-60 mg.
