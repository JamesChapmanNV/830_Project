[15]\n- Canada: In Canada, codeine is available over the counter in combination tablets with the following restrictions: no more than 8 mg per dosage unit and it must be combined with at least two other active ingredients. It is kept behind the counter, to be sold on request-- generally to those 18 and over-- after a brief consultation and at the pharmacist's discretion. The other active ingredients most commonly consist of another non-opioid analgesic (300 mg acetaminophen, as in Tylenol No. 1; or 325 mg aspirin, as in 222s) and 15 mg caffeine. OTC tablets containing ibuprofen are generally unavailable. Preparations with a codeine content higher than 8 mg per dosage unit, or fewer than two other active ingredients, are available on prescription.

Or a dealer uses Ephedrine as cut. The problem with Ephedrine (far more so than pseudephedrine) is its beta-agonist properties - it raises blood pressure and pulse far more per \"unit of high\" than methamphetamine. It is advisable to become familiar with the many ways of synthesizing methcathinone from (pseudo)ephedrine, as just such a procedure can be used on freshly produced methamphetamine to verify that the (pseudo)ephedrine was in fact reduced. The smell of basic methcathinone has been reported to resemble that of \"pistachio ice cream\". Suffice to say that it is sweet, pleasant, and to a cat-head, nirvana.
