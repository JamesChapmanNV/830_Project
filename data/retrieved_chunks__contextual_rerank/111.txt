At this dosage range the adverse effects tend to be minimal, and the pleasurable effects quite noticeable.

The Rx products are good sources of codeine for recreational use except most of us don't have sources that can obtain these drugs, therefore this FAQ contains a procedure so that one can easily obtain large amount of codeine from OTC products. Codeine is mainly used as a pain reliever, but is also used for the relief of a non-productive cough, and as a anti-diarrheal agent. 120 mg of codeine administered SC (subcutaneously, injected under the skin) provides pain relief equal to 10 mg of morphine administered by the same route.
