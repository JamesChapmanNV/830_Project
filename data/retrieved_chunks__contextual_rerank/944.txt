However, it has a rapid onset and short duration of action relative to other opioids, which can lead to compulsive redosing. Additionally, many users report noticeably less euphoria with fentanyl and its analogs. As a result, it is generally considered to have lower recreational value.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the various pharmaceutical and street forms of fentanyl, highlighting its prevalence and associated overdose risks in the US.
