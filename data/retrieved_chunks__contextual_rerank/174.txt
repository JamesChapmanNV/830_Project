Most of the compounds (8 out of 11) were identified in both influents and effluents of fifteen wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Codeine, morphine, EDDP and methadone were detected in almost all samples with median values of 69 ng/L, 28 ng/L and 18 ng/L, respectively, whereas the main cannabinoid metabolite THC-COOH presented a median value of 57 ng/L in influents. A rough estimate of heroin and cannabis consumption was performed from the analysis of target urinary metabolites in wastewater influents. Data obtained from influents of rural and urban WWTPs gave 0.07% of heroin consumption (0.67% for the largest urban WWTP) and 4% consumption of cannabinoids, respectively, for the population aged between 15 and 64 years old.
