A methamphetamine overdose will likely also result in mild brain damage due to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotoxicity.[28][33] Death from fatal methamphetamine poisoning is typically preceded by convulsions and coma.[46]\n\nEmergency treatment\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the symptoms, risks, and emergency responses associated with methamphetamine overdose, highlighting its potential severity and the signs indicating toxic levels, which is crucial for understanding the drug's harm potential and safety considerations within the broader substance profile.\n                "}
