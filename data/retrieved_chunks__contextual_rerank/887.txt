Köllisch was in the process of developing agents that would help manage excess bleeding and was interested in MDMA synthesis because it was an intermediate in the production of methylhydrastinin, the methylated analog of the hemostatic agent hydrastinine. There are no indications of interest in MDMA as an active agent itself.[1]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers safety concerns related to MDMA, including neurotoxicity retraction, cardiotoxicity, dependence potential, dangerous interactions, and serotonin syndrome risks, along with its historical synthesis by Merck in 1912.

This is more commonly reported in people who take opioids in higher doses or for longer than recommended by their healthcare providers (i.e., misuse or “abuse” opioids).
