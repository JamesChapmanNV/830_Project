However, by passing the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Regulations 2017 in September 2017, many of the restrictions currently imposed by the regulations are removed since then. The changes will mean that CBD products, where the level of other naturally occurring cannabinoids is less than 2% of the cannabinoid content, will be easier to access for medical use.[34]\n\nSwitzerland: Cannabidiol is not subject to the Narcotics Act in Switzerland because it does not produce a psychoactive effect.

Reports exist of depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts. Monitor the patient for symptoms of depression or suicidality. In animal studies, high doses of naltrexone (>1000 mg/kg) produced salivation, reduced activity, depression, tremors, and convulsions. Death in animals was due to clonic-tonic convulsions and respiratory failure.\n\nTreatment of Overdosage\n\nNo known antidote for naltrexone exists.
