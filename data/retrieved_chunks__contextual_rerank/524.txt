Anaesthesia-levels of ketamine in an unsecured setting could lead to a fatal accident, such as bathtub drowning6, 7 or suffocation. Ketamine users who are very unconscious and begin to choke or have problems breathing should be put in the Recovery Position (rolled on their side with upper arm and leg folded over, mouth so it can drain, but neck extended to facilitate breathing). See Ketamine-Related Fatalities / Deaths for a more in depth discussion of documented ketamine-related fatalities.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the serious respiratory risks and potential causes of death associated with ketamine use, including cases involving asthma, accidental drowning, or suffocation.
