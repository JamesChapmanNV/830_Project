Psychological factors - sadness at returning to an ordinary state of consciousness after ecstasy - may also account for feeling down for a while. In any event, most users report the opposite: feelings of well-being or gentle euphoria in the days following an MDMA session. To get a better understanding of why the serotonin system may be critical to normalcy for some individuals and less so for others, see Listening to Prozac by Peter D. Kramer (Viking 1993). The entire book is worthwhile, but note pages 134-136 especially. There is solid experimental evidence that MDMA, administered in large doses and/or repeatedly, causes partial loss of serotonergic neurons in laboratory animals. Uncertain is whether this loss is permanent, reversible, or important.
