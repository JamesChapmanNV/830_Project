During 2012, approximately 5.9 metric tons of illicit amphetamine were seized within EU member states;[18] the \"street price\" of illicit amphetamine within the EU ranged from €6–38 per gram during the same period.[18]\n\nOutside Europe, the illicit market for amphetamine is much smaller than the market for methamphetamine and MDMA.[18]\n\nChemistry\n\nAmphetamine, also known as alpha-methylphenethylamine, is a synthetic substance of the phenethylamine family. The chemical structure of amphetamine consists of phenethylamine, a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain, with an additional methyl substitution at Rα.

Or a dealer uses Ephedrine as cut. The problem with Ephedrine (far more so than pseudephedrine) is its beta-agonist properties - it raises blood pressure and pulse far more per \"unit of high\" than methamphetamine. It is advisable to become familiar with the many ways of synthesizing methcathinone from (pseudo)ephedrine, as just such a procedure can be used on freshly produced methamphetamine to verify that the (pseudo)ephedrine was in fact reduced. The smell of basic methcathinone has been reported to resemble that of \"pistachio ice cream\". Suffice to say that it is sweet, pleasant, and to a cat-head, nirvana. You should become familiar with this as well, in order to be able to know if suspected methamphetamine is in fact actually methcathinone.
