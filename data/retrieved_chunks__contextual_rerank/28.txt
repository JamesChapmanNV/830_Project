It is in a class of medications called antihistamines. Diphenhydramine is found in many prescription and over the counter products. Some brand names for diphenhydramine include Benadryl®, Unisom®, Sominex®, and Nytol®.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.\n\n◈ I take diphenhydramine. Can it make it harder for me to get pregnant?\n\nIt is not known if diphenhydramine can make it harder to get pregnant.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of diphenhydramine's medical uses, common brand names, and considerations during pregnancy and conception, serving as a patient-focused summary within the comprehensive chemical and pharmacological information presented in the full document.\n                "}

It can be comprehensively described through its variations as delirious in believability, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. They usually follow themes of memory replays and semi-realistic or expected events. For example, people could be casually holding objects or performing actions which one would expect them to be in real life before disappearing and dissolving under further inspection. Common examples of this include seeing people wearing glasses, or hats when they are not and mistaking objects for human beings or animals.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details MDMA's visual and hallucinatory effects, specifically discussing external hallucinations involving autonomous entities, environments, and visual scenarios.
