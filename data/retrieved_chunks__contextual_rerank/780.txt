Morphine has potentially serious side effects such as respiratory depression and low blood pressure, which can be fatal when it is mixed with other depressants. Other side effects of morphine include drowsiness, vomiting, and constipation.\n\n\n\nThe primary source of morphine is isolation from poppy straw of the opium poppy.\n\nMorphine can be administered orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally. It reaches its maximum effect in around 20 min when given intravenously and 60 min when given orally while the duration of effect is between three and seven hours.[8][9] Long-acting formulations also exist such as, Kadian which is capable of producing clinically significant effects for upwards of 24 hours.[10][11]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of morphine's historical discovery, subjective effects, and methods of administration, highlighting its potent pain-relief properties, side effects like respiratory depression, and common routes of use with onset times and duration.
