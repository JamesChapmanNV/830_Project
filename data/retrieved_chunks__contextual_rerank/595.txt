The bioavailability of morphine is 80-100%. There is significant first-pass metabolism, therefore oral doses are 6 times larger than parenteral doses to achieve the same effect. Morphine reaches steady-state concentrations after 24-48 hours. Parenteral morphine has a Tmax of 15 minutes and oral morphine has a Tmax of 90 minutes, with a Cmax of 283nmol/L. The AUC of morphine is 225-290nmol\\*h/L.\n\nRoute of Elimination\n\n70-80% of an administered dose is excreted within 48 hours. Morphine is predominantly eliminated in the urine with 2-10% of a dose recovered as the unchanged parent drug. 7-10% of a dose of morphine is eliminated in the feces.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides detailed pharmacokinetic data on morphine, including absorption, bioavailability, time to steady state, and routes of elimination, supporting the comprehensive overview of morphine’s chemical, physical, and biological properties found throughout the document. It highlights key parameters such as high oral bioavailability, rapid Tmax, and predominant urinary excretion, which are essential for understanding morphine’s clinical pharmacology and environmental behavior.\n                "}
