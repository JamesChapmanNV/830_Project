It is not known what effect withdrawal could have on a pregnancy. Your healthcare provider can talk with you about any changes to your ketamine use.\n\n◈ I take ketamine.

You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be Methamphetamine HCl. If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts \"popping\", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead.
