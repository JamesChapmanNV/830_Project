LSD does not cause physical dependence (as determined by the development of a withdrawal syndrome upon drug discontinuation following long-term administration). It is also not likely to lead to psychological dependence in most people, although there are a few reports of individuals who have taken it daily for months. As with most substances, a few people have reported developing a bad relationship with LSD, where they continue to use the drug despite adverse consequences in their lives. Tolerance (a reduction in response after taking the same dose of a drug on a subsequent occasion) begins with a single dose of LSD, due to a reduction (\"down-regulation\") of serotonin 5HT2 receptors. This effect is increased following continued use of LSD the next day, but reverses over time. Thus, using LSD two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, but this effect is less likely if LSD is taken with at least three\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt explains LSD's lack of physical dependence potential, emphasizing that it does not cause withdrawal or psychological addiction in most users. It details how tolerance develops after a single dose due to serotonin receptor down-regulation, affecting subsequent experiences. This section is relevant for understanding LSD's safety profile and is key for researchers, medical professionals, and users seeking addiction and dependency information within the comprehensive drug guide.\n                "}
