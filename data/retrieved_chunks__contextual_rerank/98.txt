This should be used with extreme caution, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. This interaction can also amplify the anxiety, confusion and delusion producing aspects of cannabis significantly. Those who choose to use this combination are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose, and slow down the pace of their normal intake considerably.\n\nDissociatives - Dissociatives can enhance the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects of psilocybin mushrooms. Dissociative-induced holes, spaces, and voids while under the influence of psilocybin can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone, along with more intense internal hallucinations, confusion, nausea, delusions and increased risk of psychosis.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the combination effects of psilocybin mushrooms with other substances, highlighting how cannabis and dissociatives can significantly amplify the visual, cognitive, and perceptual experiences associated with psychedelics, while also increasing associated risks such as anxiety, confusion, nausea, and psychosis. It is part of a comprehensive overview of drug interactions under the section on effects and safety considerations of psilocybin mushrooms.\n                "}

In response to concerns about the increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic substances by the general public, psychedelics like psilocybin began to receive negative press and faced increasingly restrictive laws.\n\nIn the United States, laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic substances. Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year.[18] Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the Schedule I category of illicit substances in 1970. Subsequent restrictions on the use of these substances in human research made funding for such projects difficult to obtain, and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being \"professionally marginalized\".[19]\n\nIn 1976 the book Psilocybin Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide was released, written by Terence McKenna.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the historical suppression of psilocybin research and advocacy, highlighting key figures like Leary and Alpert's influence, subsequent legal restrictions in the US including Schedule I classification, and notable publications such as McKenna's guide, illustrating the shift from cultural use to prohibition.
