If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness during maternal morphine use, a physician should be contacted immediately. Some evidence suggests that IV ketorolac, oral ibuprofen and acetaminophen as part of a multimodal post-cesarean section analgesia reduces percentage of mothers who fail exclusive breastfeeding compared to patient-controlled IV morphine-based analgesia.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed guidance on postpartum pain management with morphine, emphasizing limited maternal opioid use (2-3 days) and close infant monitoring to prevent adverse effects such as excessive sleepiness or breathing issues. It highlights alternative nonnarcotic analgesics like ketorolac, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, which may support breastfeeding success. This information is relevant to the document's comprehensive coverage of morphine's safety, usage, and maternal-infant considerations.\n                "}
