If codeine just doesn't work for you, this may be why. Some drugs also interfere with cyp2d6. Prime among these are the SSRIs, with the exception of Zoloft (if I remember correctly). The most potent inhibitor is paroxetine (paxil), followed by fluoxetine (prozac). If you are taking an SSRI, you will probably experience a markedly decreased euphoria when using codeine. (Paxil has a half life of only 24hrs, so not taking it for a few days will do miracles; the half life of prozac is 7 days.) Finally, codeine itself is a cyp2d6 inhibitor. This means that taking the whole dose as quickly as possible will probably give you the biggest high (ie. its a waste to redose in 30 mins). *GLUTHETHIMIDE A combination of codeine and gluthethimide (a sleeping agent) has been used in some places as a heroin substitute. Gluthethimide is an enzyme-inducer, and it allows the body to convert more than 10% of codeine into morphine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt explains factors affecting codeine's effectiveness and euphoria, highlighting how certain drugs like SSRIs (especially paroxetine and fluoxetine) can interfere with CYP2D6 enzymatic conversion of codeine to morphine, reducing its psychoactive effects. It also mentions that codeine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor and describes the use of gluthethimide combined with codeine to enhance morphine conversion, relevant to sections on pharmacology and drug interactions within the full document.\n                "}

Codeine is closely related to morphine as both contain an oxygen group at R3, but this oxygen group in codeine is substituted by a methyl group (making a methoxy group). Codeine is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, heroin, ethylmorphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone.\n\nPharmacology\n\nCodeine is not itself centrally active, and must first be converted via first-pass metabolism into morphine by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 (as such, it is a prodrug for morphine). Codeine is also metabolized into the inactive norcodeine via the CYP3A4 enzyme system. Both resultant forms are conjugated by UGT2B7 into their corresponding 3-glucuronide.[citation needed]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details the chemical structure of codeine, highlighting its similarities and differences with morphine and other morphinans, such as dihydrocodeine and heroin. It explains how these structural features relate to its pharmacological activity, specifically its conversion to morphine via CYP2D6 metabolism, underscoring its status as a prodrug. This information is critical for understanding codeine’s chemical basis and metabolic processes.\n                "}

Codeine and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen-containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13 with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan. Codeine (along with other morphinans) contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R4 and R5 through an oxygen group. It contains a hydroxy group (OH-) bound at R6 and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R17.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides an overview of common formulations and the chemical structure of codeine, highlighting its classification as a morphinan opioid. It details the various forms in which codeine is available and discusses its molecular architecture, including key structural features like the phenanthrene core, ether bridge, hydroxy group, and methyl group on the nitrogen. This information is essential for understanding codeine’s physical appearance, pharmacology, and interaction mechanisms discussed elsewhere in the document.\n                "}
