The terrorists threatened to kill everyone inside unless Russia ended the war in Chechnya. Although the Chechen militants agreed to release some of the hostages during the first couple of days, negotiations with the Russian authorities eventually stalled. Just before dawn on October 26, Russian special police units resorted to using an incapacitating gas based on the drug fentanyl to end the crisis. All of the Chechen militants were killed, and most of the civilian captives survived. But while the operation was largely a success, at least 117 of the hostages died from the effects of the gas. /Incapacitating gas based on the drug fentanyl/\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a historical incident involving the use of fentanyl-based incapacitating gas during the 2002 Moscow theater crisis, highlighting fentanyl's role in mass casualty events and its serious toxicological effects.

But Cash wanted to keep the pitcher loose and happy, so he smiled and said nothing. Doc Ellis went on to finished the game without a hit. The Pirates won the game, 2-0, despite Ellis walking eight batters. Dock had a pretty good year in 1970.
