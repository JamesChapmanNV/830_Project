It was often used with hydroxyzine 50 mg or promethazine 25 mg intramuscularly. Outcomes were compared to those of women who received no meperidine. Although women who received meperidine plus levallorphan had several indications of more difficult labor and delivery, there was no difference in the rates of suckling difficulties or breastfeeding rates at discharge or 1 month postpartum between the groups. No differences between dosages of meperidine received was found.[25]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt describes a retrospective study on intramuscular use of meperidine combined with levallorphan for severe labor pain in a Japanese hospital lacking epidural analgesia.

A 41-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) for altered mental status shortly after ingesting 3 beige Norco pills bearing a Watson imprint. She had pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression, which reversed after 0.4 mg naloxone administration intravenously. She had complete recovery and was discharged from the ED after a 4-hour observation period.
