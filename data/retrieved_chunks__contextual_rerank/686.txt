Adverse effects of the drug in opiate-naive patients generally increase as serum concentrations exceed 2 ng/mL, although respiratory depression (e.g., hypoventilation) can occur throughout the therapeutic range of fentanyl serum concentrations, especially in patients with underlying pulmonary conditions or those receiving concomitant therapy with respiratory depressants. CNS depression becomes prominent as serum fentanyl concentrations exceed 3 ng/mL in opiate-naive patients, and anesthesia and profound respiratory depression generally occur at concentrations of 10-20 ng/mL. With continued use, tolerance to the pharmacologic and adverse effects of the drug develop, but the rate of development of tolerance exhibits considerable interindividual variation.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses fentanyl drug tolerance, highlighting serum concentration ranges linked to analgesic effectiveness and adverse effects, including respiratory depression and CNS depression, in opiate-naive patients. It emphasizes the development of tolerance with continued use and the variability in individual responses, making it relevant for understanding fentanyl's pharmacodynamics and safety profile within the comprehensive drug information document.\n                "}

Post-mortem femoral blood was screened for amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opioids with immunological methods (EMIT II) and further with headspace gas chromatography for alcohol and with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for different drugs, including fentanyl. ... In the first case, the toxicological analysis revealed fentanyl (2.7 ng/mL), morphine (31.4 ng/mL), and ethanol (1.1 g/L) in postmortem blood and amphetamine, cannabinoids, morphine, and ethanol (1.4 g/L) in postmortem urine. In the second case, the analysis revealed fentanyl (13.8 ng/mL), 7-aminoclonazepam (57.1 ng/mL), and sertralin (91.9 ng/mL) in postmortem blood and a small amount of ethanol (0.1 g/L) in postmortem urine. ...\n\nPMID:15568716\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details forensic case reports of fatal intravenous fentanyl injection from patches, with postmortem blood analyses showing fentanyl concentrations of 2.7 and 13.8 ng/mL, respectively, alongside other drugs like morphine, ethanol, and benzodiazepines.
