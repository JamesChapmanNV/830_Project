Codeine is a widely used opioid, which is metabolized to morphine to elicit analgesia. Prolonged morphine exposure exacerbates pain by activating the innate immune toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the central nervous system. In silico docking simulations indicate codeine also docks to MD2, an accessory protein for TLR4, suggesting potential to induce TLR4-dependent pain facilitation. We hypothesized codeine would cause TLR4-dependent hyperalgesia/allodynia that is disparate from its opioid receptor-dependent analgesic rank potency. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were assessed using hotplate and von Frey tests at days 0, 3 and 5 in mice receiving intraperitoneal equimolar codeine (21 mg kg(-1)), morphine (20 mg kg(-1)) or saline, twice daily. This experiment was repeated in animals with prior partial nerve injury and in TLR4 null mutant mice. Interventions with interleukin-1 receptor\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details recent research on the neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying opioid-induced hyperalgesia, highlighting codeine's potential to activate TLR4 and exacerbate pain sensitivity independently of its analgesic effects. It is relevant within the broader pharmacology and toxicity discussion, illustrating molecular pathways and behavioral effects associated with chronic opioid use. Key details include mouse models, dosing regimens, and intervention strategies targeting TLR4-mediated pain facilitation.\n                "}
