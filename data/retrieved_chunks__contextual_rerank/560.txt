It wasn't until after these military conflicts that morphine habituation gained a reputation as the \"soldier's disease\" or the \"army disease\". With the addictive and habit forming properties of morphine now known the medical establishment was on the lookout for a less addictive alternative to morphine. This came in the form of diacetylmorphine or as it was later marketed, Heroin. Although it was later learned that heroin was not less addictive than codeine and in fact the contrary.

Morphine and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13 with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt covers the production and usage of morphine, highlighting its source from the opium poppy and global manufacturing estimates, as well as its chemical classification as a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid within the morphinan class, providing vital background on its origins, chemical structure, and industrial relevance.\n                "}

When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of morphine develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. Morphine presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of morphine all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the potential for dependence and abuse associated with morphine, emphasizing its high addictive potential, the development of tolerance over time, and the associated risks of physical and psychological dependence.
