This is brominated and reacted with 2-amino-5-methylpyridine to give the imidazopyridine. From here the reactions use a variety of reagents to complete the synthesis, either involving thionyl chloride or sodium cyanide. These reagents are challenging to handle and require thorough safety assessments.[4] Though such safety procedures are common in industry, they make clandestine manufacture difficult.\n\nA number of major side-products of the sodium cyanide reaction have been characterised and include dimers and mannich products.[5]\n\nPharmacology\n\nZolpidem interacts with the GABA-BZ receptor system[6] and shares some of the pharmacological properties of traditional benzodiazepines.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section covers the chemical synthesis, classification, and pharmacology of zolpidem, highlighting its relation to other GABA-A agonists and its synthesis methods involving specific precursors and reagents.
