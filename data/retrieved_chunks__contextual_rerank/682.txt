This occurs due to the way in which opioids functionally mimic the body's natural endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (pain reduction), sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure and enjoyment. They are believed to be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's euphoric, analgesic (pain relief), and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects.\n\nMorphine is produced by the human body in small amounts and acts as an immunomodulator. Endogenous morphine binds preferentially to the μ3 opioid receptor.[28]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section details morphine's pharmacological mechanism of action, explaining how it binds to and activates the μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors to produce analgesic, euphoric, and anxiolytic effects. It also notes that endogenous morphine exists in small amounts in the body and interacts with the μ3 receptor, highlighting both the drug's and body's natural opioid functions. This information is crucial for understanding morphine's effects and receptor targets detailed elsewhere in the document.\n                "}
