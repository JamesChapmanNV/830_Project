Morphine reduced the respiratory rate, VO2 and VCO2 greater than clonidine at all dosages used (p<0.05, morphine vs. clonidine, for all metabolic and respiratory parameters). Furthermore, morphine induced prolonged respiratory pauses, which were not observed in animals treated with clonidine or saline. Morphine caused hypothermia which was dose dependent, while clonidine stabilized CBT in comparison to saline treated animals (p<0.0001). In the newborn rat, morphine causes profound respiratory depression and hypothermia while clonidine causes minimal respiratory depression and stabilizes CBT. All together, we suggest that clonidine promotes autonomic stability and may be a desirable agent to use in infants being treated with therapeutic\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes research on the effects of morphine and clonidine on respiratory and metabolic parameters in neonatal rat pups, highlighting morphine's dose-dependent respiratory depression and hypothermia, and clonidine's stabilizing effects.
