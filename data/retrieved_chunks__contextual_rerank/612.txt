For instance, CBD is more effective than vitamin C and E as a neuroprotective antioxidant and can ameliorate skin conditions such as acne.[20][21] It should be noted that cannabidiol has been the subject of sensational health claims in the popular media. A 2016 study found that there is only limited high-quality evidence for cannabidiol having any neurological effect in people.[22]\n\nResearch\n\nCBD is under preliminary research for its potential antipsychotic effect, possibly mitigating some of the negative, psychosis-like effects of THC.[23][24]\n\nRisks with vaped/smoked CBD\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides an overview of cannabidiol’s medical uses, therapeutic properties, and research status, including its approved treatments like Epidiolex in the U.S., potential neuroprotective effects, and ongoing studies into its antipsychotic properties.
