On the basis of chemical degradation and correlation with cannabinol, a general structure was proposed. In 1963, Raphael Mechoulam isolated CBD from Lebanese hashish and established its structure and relative stereochemistry.[7] Its absolute stereochemistry was determined in 1967.[7]\n\nAdulterated CBD-products\n\nAt least 128 samples out of more than 350 tested by government labs in nine states, nearly all in the South, had 371 types of synthetic cannabinoids in products marketed as CBD. Half of the 28 tested CBD-vape products contained less than 0.3% CBD.[8]\n\nChemistry\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section provides historical, cultural, and chemical background on cannabidiol (CBD), highlighting its first isolation in 1940, structural elucidation by Raphael Mechoulam in the 1960s, and issues with adulterated CBD products containing synthetic cannabinoids, relevant to understanding CBD's origins, chemistry, and quality concerns discussed in the broader document.\n                "}

Secondly: 50 times more CBD than THC is needed to reduce acute effects of THC,[26] which makes it practically impossible to administer proper dosage by inhalation. Also, the quantity of CBD converted into THC will increase a lot with the required ratio, and excessive harshness in the lungs may escalate a bad trip.\n\nToxicity and harm potential\n\nAccording to clinical studies, cannabidiol is well-tolerated and shows little to no toxicity.[27]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section summarizes current research on cannabidiol’s potential antipsychotic effects, risks associated with vaping or smoking CBD (notably the conversion to THC at high temperatures), and its overall low toxicity profile based on clinical studies, highlighting both therapeutic prospects and safety considerations within the broader overview of CBD's pharmacology and harm potential.\n                "}
