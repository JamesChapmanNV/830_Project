They are somewhat comparable to the visuals produced by deliriants and are more frequent in darker areas. Scenarios consisting of severe sleep deprivation caused by wakefulness can lead to more intense visual effects and even hallucinations . Suppressions Double vision Distortions Visual drifting - This effect is usually subtle or barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with cannabis . It is most prominent when smoked or taken intravenously and is usually delirious in nature. Commonly this, high dosages or prolonged use can cause level 1-2 visual drifting. Brightness alteration Hallucinatory states Transformations - This effect occurs very rarely, and typically only when the user has taken high doses, is coming down, or has been awake for unusually long periods. They are usually very mild when they do happen to occur.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the visual effects associated with methamphetamine use, highlighting their variability, mild intensity at higher doses, and specific phenomena such as visual drifting, hallucinations, and transformations.

Increased music appreciation - This effect usually manifests itself through an increase in both the hedonic and thrillingly emotional impact of musical acoustic phenomena, often leading to a “hyped“ or adrenaline rush type of feeling. For some users, an enhanced comprehension of subtle details in the music or a feeling of deeper understanding with regards to composition and lyrics has been reported what is essentially less common compared to many other hallucinogenic compounds. The overall effect is, for the most part mainly indicative of an all-around increased enthusiasm towards hearing music in general. Rarely, one may find music to be annoying or distracting rather than enhanced - this seems to be largely set and setting based and happens rarely.

These are brief and fleeting, but frequent and completely believable and convincing as they happen.
