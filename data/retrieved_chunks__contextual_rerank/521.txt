Patients' vital signs must be obtained, and their overall physical and mental health status should be evaluated. Pharmacists should refrain from dispensing buprenorphine if the patient appears lethargic or intoxicated. In some cases, pharmacists may need to withhold the dose of buprenorphine. The prescriber must be notified of these plans and prioritize patient safety. Given buprenorphine's long half-life, the drug can typically be withheld for 1 day with minimal adverse effects. The patient can then be released the next day. If the patient exhibits signs of respiratory depression and/or hypotension, they should be promptly evaluated in the emergency room and treated as any other opioid overdose patient.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides detailed information on the toxicity, toxicological assessment, and clinical management of buprenorphine, emphasizing the importance of monitoring for adverse effects such as respiratory depression and hypotension.
