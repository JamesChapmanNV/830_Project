The exact pathogenesis is uncertain. There are several hypotheses including direct damage to the end artery, cytotoxic effects of the implicated drug or additives in the injectable preparations. Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol and opioid dependence. The patient received intramuscular naltrexone for treatment of alcoholism. A week later, she presented with what appeared to be cellulitis at the site of injection. It progressed in spite of antibiotics and mimicked an abscess. Attempted incision and drainage however yielded no pus. Deep tissue necrosis was seen and histopathology was consistent with Nicolau syndrome. As per our knowledge, this is the first reported case of naltrexone associated Nicolau syndrome that masqueraded as a\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details a rare case of Nicolau syndrome (embolia cutis medicamentosa) associated with intramuscular naltrexone, highlighting potential severe skin necrosis as a adverse reaction.

While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it. When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate. The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch with shaking until the batch is strongly basic.

A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch with shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. With free base meth now obtained, the next step, as usual, is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract as described in Chapter 5. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The procedure for that is also described in\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details the chemical process of converting methamphetamine free base into its hydrochloride salt, including neutralization with lye, extraction with toluene, and purification steps such as distillation.
