Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice[11]. This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected[11]. Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6. People who are on medicines that inhibit CYP2D6, or that lack the enzyme due to a genetic mutation will not respond to codeine as it can not be metabolized into its active product: morphine.\n\nLegal status\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section explains how grapefruit juice can influence the metabolism of certain opioids, including tramadol, oxycodone, fentanyl, and methadone, through inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme, potentially increasing toxicity. It also notes that codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6, with genetic variations affecting their activity. This information is relevant to understanding drug interactions and safety considerations in opioid use.\n                "}
