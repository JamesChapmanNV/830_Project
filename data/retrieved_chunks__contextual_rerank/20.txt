Most users consider this to be a waste of their tripping experience, especially as it can make them sick to their stomachs. While fatalities caused by the direct pharmacological effects of ketamine are nearly unheard of at normal recreational doses, ketamine is a powerful anaesthetic and being anaesthetized, semi-conscious, or unconscious carries distinct risks. Body positions that restrict breathing or blood-flow (e.g. \"child's pose\" or face down into a pillow) can result in serious injury or death even if the person is conscious. Extreme care should be taken before combining ketamine with respiratory depressants such as alcohol, GHB, opiates, barbiturates, and/or benzodiazepines. This can be very dangerous. While most (if not all) of these combinations have been used without negative incident, this does NOT mean that they should be considered safe.
