A heavy feeling in the limbs also becomes quite noticeable. This will peak at 1hr with the effects slowly tapering off after 2hr. Due to the difficulty in obtaining Rx drugs containing enough codeine to be used recreationally, I have included a procedure that allows one to extract the codeine from OTC products to obtain enough of the drug to use recreationally. This extraction can *only* be used on OTC products containing either acetaminophen or aspirin in addition to the codeine. There is one exception to this rule. Products containing caffeine can be used with the knowledge that the most of the caffeine contained in the OTC product, *will* be found in the finished product. This should not matter to most people, but to those with problems in taking caffeine, *you have been warned*! [I have found that it is better to use products containing asprin, as opposed to tylenol, because the filtering process goes more smoothly and, if one is not\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the peak and tapering of codeine's effects at around one to two hours and details a recommended procedure for extracting codeine from OTC products containing acetaminophen or aspirin, with a note on caffeine content.
