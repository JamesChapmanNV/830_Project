The aim of the study was to describe codeine intoxication experiences amongst recreational drug users, as posted on public Internet forums. Internet searches were carried out by using the specific key word 'codeine' and in combination with 'experience', 'report', 'trip' and 'forum'. 96 Trip reports and 156 thread discussions relating to the sole use of codeine were analyzed using the empirical phenomenological psychological (EPP) method. Nine themes and 72 categories emerged. Narratives illustrated transitions between medical and non-medical use of codeine for dulling of emotional and/or physical pain, opiate withdrawal management and for intoxication. Codeine's appeal centered on access via family medicine cabinets, prescribers and pharmacies. Discussion and dissemination of indigenous harm reduction tactics included the learning to appreciate codeine's effect\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt summarizes a study analyzing online reports of non-medical, recreational codeine use, highlighting themes of abuse, harm reduction, and user experiences. It provides insights into the social and behavioral aspects of codeine misuse, which are relevant for understanding drug abuse trends and public health risks discussed in the broader document. The section emphasizes patterns of intoxication, access issues, and harm reduction strategies documented from internet forums.\n                "}

As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy and memory loss. Some people may also have an allergic reaction to codeine, such as the swelling of skin and rashes.[10] It is also potentially lethal when mixed with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.\n\nTolerance and addiction potential\n\nAs with other opioids, the chronic use of codeine can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section discusses the toxicity, harm potential, and addiction risks associated with codeine, highlighting its low toxicity relative to dosage, potential allergic reactions, and dangers when combined with depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines.

This of course will result in a positive result in a drug test for the opiates. It is not known whether or not the drugs heroin, morphine or codeine can be separately determined on a drug test. In other words it isn't likely that the drug tester can determine which of the three above drugs you have taken, he just knows you've taken one or more of them. Note! Addiction to codeine can occur. Tolerance is also seen with chronic use. Although the withdrawal is minimal with codeine, it is not a fun time. Please be cautious in your use of the drug. Some common side effects from codeine include drowsiness, light-headedness, dry mouth, urinary retention (difficulty in urination), constipation and of course, euphoria. Adverse effects can include itchiness (common), confusion, nausea and vomiting. The nausea experienced with codeine is less common and less intense than that experienced with the stronger opiates\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the pharmacology and side effects of codeine, emphasizing its metabolism to morphine, drug testing considerations, and potential for addiction, tolerance, and adverse effects like drowsiness, nausea, and constipation, providing critical safety information within the comprehensive guide on codeine use and extraction techniques.\n                "}
