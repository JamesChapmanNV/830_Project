Hydromorphone fractions were lower in women compared with men (0.11 versus 0.13; P < 0.0001). Hydrocodone mole fractions were higher in the 65-year and older age group compared with the 16- to 39-year age group (0.4 versus 0.36; P < or = 0.005). Concurrent use of a CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitor altered hydromorphone and norhydrocodone mole fractions, compared with the control group. Patient factors affect hydrocodone and metabolite mole fractions and suggest increased awareness of their contribution when attempting to interpret urine drug testing results.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This section summarizes research findings on how patient-specific factors like sex, age, and use of metabolic inhibitors influence the urinary metabolite ratios of hydromorphone and hydrocodone.
