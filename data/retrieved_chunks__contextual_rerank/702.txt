Thirty of 35 mothers reported that infant sedation ceased with maternal codeine discontinuation. Mothers of affected infants were also more likely to experience lethargy and other side effects than mothers of unaffected infants. Mothers who took oxycodone reported a similar rate of infant sedation (20%) compared to codeine, but the groups were statistically different in parity and postmenstrual age (PMA), with the codeine group having a slightly higher PMA.[30]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details studies on maternal use of opioids, specifically codeine and oxycodone, during breastfeeding and their effects on infant sedation and side effects.

A heavy feeling in the limbs also becomes quite noticeable. This will peak at 1hr with the effects slowly tapering off after 2hr. Due to the difficulty in obtaining Rx drugs containing enough codeine to be used recreationally, I have included a procedure that allows one to extract the codeine from OTC products to obtain enough of the drug to use recreationally. This extraction can *only* be used on OTC products containing either acetaminophen or aspirin in addition to the codeine. There is one exception to this rule. Products containing caffeine can be used with the knowledge that the most of the caffeine contained in the OTC product, *will* be found in the finished product. This should not matter to most people, but to those with problems in taking caffeine, *you have been warned*!
