Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses harm reduction strategies and social stabilization efforts associated with opioid agonist therapy (OAT), highlighting its role in reducing crime, marginalization, and illicit opioid use.
