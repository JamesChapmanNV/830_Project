Long-term use of amphetamines can result in tooth rot (dental caries) and loss of teeth. [Shaner 2002] Regular amphetamine use can lead to gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). This may be the result of prolonged dry mouth which can cause the gums to become inflamed, worsening oral health.

It provides frequency and certainty levels for these adverse effects, emphasizing their commonality and established links, making it relevant for understanding long-term health consequences outlined in the broader document on drug effects.\n                "}
