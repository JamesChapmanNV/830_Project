There is concern that analgesic substitutes, such as codeine, will not be as safe or effective. The purpose of this study is to compare the demographics, adverse events, and medical outcomes of patients who had unintentional hydrocodone or codeine exposures through the use of a state's poison center database. The Texas Poison Center Network's database was utilized to find all reported unintentional ingestions or adverse reactions of products containing codeine or hydrocodone. Comparisons were made between the two medications by calculating the rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Children aged 5 years or younger were more exposed to codeine (51.6%). Hydrocodone exposures had more serious outcomes (11% vs. 9%; RR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.73-0.91) and had more nausea\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses adverse effects and safety considerations related to opioids, specifically comparing unintentional exposures to hydrocodone and codeine based on poison center data, highlighting differences in outcomes, age groups affected, and associated symptoms such as nausea. It is relevant to the document's comprehensive review of chemical safety, toxicity, and medical research on opioids like codeine. The data emphasizes patterns in accidental exposures and health risks, supporting the broader context of opioid safety assessment.\n                "}
