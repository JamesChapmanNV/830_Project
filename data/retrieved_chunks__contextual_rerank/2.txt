This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nMorphine can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.\n\nDependence and abuse potential\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the serious risks of overdose with morphine, including respiratory depression and death, and highlights the importance of harm reduction practices such as preventing aspiration by lying in the recovery position.
