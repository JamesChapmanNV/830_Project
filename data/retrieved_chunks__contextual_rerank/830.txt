The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Oxycodone presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of oxycodone all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the development of tolerance, addiction potential, and cross-tolerance related to oxycodone use, which are key considerations within the broader section on toxicity, harm potential, and safety guidelines. It highlights how prolonged use affects dosage requirements and the implications for overdose risk and dependency. Understanding these dynamics is essential for harm reduction and responsible usage.\n                "}

Among the changes, the FDA is requiring a new boxed warning about the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death. Today's actions are among a number of steps the agency recently outlined in a plan to reassess its approach to opioid medications. The plan is focused on policies aimed at reversing the epidemic, while still providing patients in pain access to effective relief.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details an FDA safety communication issued on March 22, 2016, highlighting new required labeling and boxed warnings for immediate-release opioid pain medications.
