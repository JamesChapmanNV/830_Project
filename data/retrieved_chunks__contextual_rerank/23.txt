See http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1106/pdfs/uksi_20141106_en.pdf. Previously, ketamine became a Class C drug as of Jan 1, 2006. See http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4564606.stm and OPSI.gov.uk. The move had been expected since a spring 2004 ACMD report that recommended moving ketamine into Class C. Prior to Jan 1, 2006, Ketamine was not controlled in the U.K. under the Misuse of Drugs Act, making it legal to possess. However sales and distribution were controlled under the Medicines Act making it illegal to sell or distribute without a license.
