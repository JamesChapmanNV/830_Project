[Details] Original Author Unknown Maintained and Updated by Erowid You may have heard about \"no-hitter\" that Bob Milacki's of the Oakland A's pitched last week. No-hitters are pretty rare and this one made the news everywhere. One of the local TV stations refered to it as Milacki's \"no-no,\" a term that originated with Dock Ellis's no-hitter back on June 12th, 1970 for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Dock pitched that game on acid. Reportedly he wrote about the experience in his authobiography (Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball) published in 1976.
