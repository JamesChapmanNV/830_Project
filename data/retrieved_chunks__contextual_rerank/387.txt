It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.[34]\n\nDangerous interactions\n\nMorphine is dangerous to use in combination with other depressants as many fatalities reported as overdoses are caused by interactions with other depressant drugs like alcohol or benzodiazepines, resulting in dangerously high levels of respiratory depression.[35]\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt discusses the dangers of opioid overdose, emphasizing how reduced tolerance after cessation increases overdose risk and how environmental factors influence this risk. It also highlights the heightened danger of combining morphine with other depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines, which can lead to fatal respiratory depression.

Tramadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl are all primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, which is potently inhibited by grapefruit juice[36]. This may cause the drug to take longer to clear from the body. it may increase toxicity with repeated doses. Methadone may also be affected[36]. Codeine and hydrocodone are metabolized by CYP2D6.
