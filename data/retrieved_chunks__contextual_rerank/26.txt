Although the clinical scenarios may vary among patients, one of the main concerns is the level of expression of OIRD. In such cases, oxygen administration and respiratory assistance are a priority. An opioid drug antagonist such as naloxone can help to correct OIRD symptoms. Commonly, repeated doses are necessary since, over time, respiratory depression may overcome the effects of the antagonist drug, particularly with opiates such as fentanyl, in which increased receptor affinity may be present as compared to other opiates. Thus, the therapeutic approach should continue until a normal respiratory rate coincides with appropriate oxygen saturation levels.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt provides a detailed description of typical clinical manifestations and emergency management strategies for fentanyl overdose, highlighting symptoms like respiratory depression and the use of naloxone. It is relevant within the full document as part of the safety, toxicity, and emergency treatment information, emphasizing vital interventions such as oxygen therapy and dosing considerations in overdose scenarios.\n                "}
