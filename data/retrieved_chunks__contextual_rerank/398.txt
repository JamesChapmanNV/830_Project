Example products containing codeine include Néocodion (cough pills, and syrup), Codoliprane (codeine with paracetamol), Prontalgine and Migralgine (codeine, paracetamol, and caffeine).[16] Codeine is regulated/controlled substance (schedule 2) since 2017 after a decision of the \"Minister of Health\" Agnès Buzyn, it is therefore now under prescription only and raw pure codeine is not available altogether anymore. The most common prescribed codeine brands are Klipal and Codoliprane, both mixed with paracetamol heavily. Klipal being the strongest ratio, 50mg codeine for 600mg paracetamol.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This excerpt details France's regulatory status and common formulations of codeine-containing medications, noting that most preparations no longer require a prescription since 2017 when codeine was classified as a Schedule 2 controlled substance. It highlights specific products like Néocodion, Codoliprane, and others, emphasizing the shift to prescription-only access and mentioning frequently prescribed brands such as Klipal and Codoliprane with their typical dosages.\n                "}
