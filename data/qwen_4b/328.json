Okay, let's tackle this content classification. The user provided a statement about crypto and NFTs. The content mentions that "those same just reward of holders leaving everyone else out of future projects" and that this is antithetical to crypto where everyone has a shot. It also predicts NFTs will be revamped to shed a "toxic shell."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs or drug-related terms. The content talks about crypto, NFTs, and projects, but there's no mention of drugs, illegal substances, or anything related to drug abuse. The terms used are related to blockchain, rewards, and project revamps. There's no slang, euphemisms, or references to drug use. The context is entirely about cryptocurrency and its future developments. Since there's no drug-related content here, the classification should be False. The explanation should highlight the absence of drug mentions and the focus on crypto topics.
