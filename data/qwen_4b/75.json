Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet: "Wait - we're told it was no way no how and overdose, weren't we?" I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related.

First, I'll break down the content. The phrase "no way no how" is a common slang expression that can mean something is impossible or not possible. The mention of "overdose" is a critical point. Overdose is directly related to drug use, especially opioids or other substances that can lead to overdose. However, the context here is a bit unclear. The user is asking if they were told that an overdose occurred, which might be in a medical or emergency context. 

But wait, the key is whether the content is promoting, encouraging, or glorifying drug abuse. The sentence doesn't mention any drug use or abuse directly. It's more about questioning a statement about an overdose. The term "overdose" itself is a serious medical issue, but the content isn't promoting or discussing drug use in a way that's abusive. It's more of a rhetorical question about a situation that's already happened. 

Looking at the definitions: True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. Here, the content doesn't mention any drugs or their misuse. It's about an overdose, which could be related to drug use, but the content isn't promoting or encouraging it. The user is just questioning a statement about an overdose, not discussing drug use. 

So the label should be False. The explanation would be that the content refers to an overdose but doesn't promote or discuss drug abuse. The terms are in a medical or situational context without encouraging misuse.
