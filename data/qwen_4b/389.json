Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "We really gonna keep glorifying mfers that die from an Overdose at 50 years old? Nah! Not me." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The user is talking about "mfers" which is a slang term for meth users. The mention of overdose and the context of glorifying those who die from it seems like it's discussing drug abuse. The phrase "glorifying" suggests that the speaker is supporting or approving of the behavior, which could be seen as encouraging drug misuse. 

But wait, the user is responding to a question about whether society should glorify people who die from overdoses. The speaker is rejecting that idea, saying "Nah! Not me." So they're against glorifying it. However, the mention of "mfers" and overdose is still related to drug abuse. The key here is whether the content is promoting or encouraging drug use. Since the speaker is against glorifying it, maybe it's not directly promoting. But the presence of the term "mfers" (which is slang for meth users) and the context of overdose might still fall under illicit drug-related content. 

Looking at the definitions, True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse, even if it's in a negative context. The user is discussing the death from overdose, which is a consequence of drug abuse. The use of "glorifying" could be seen as a critique of that, but the content itself is still about drug-related issues. 

So the label here might be True because it's discussing drug abuse (meth use leading to overdose) and the context of glorifying such deaths, which could be seen as promoting or discussing the abuse. Even though the speaker is against it, the content is still related to illicit drug use. Therefore, the answer should be True.
