Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "get those tablets with paracetamol and codeine. Will sort you right out." 

First, I need to check if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The user mentioned paracetamol and codeine. Paracetamol is an OTC drug, but codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. The phrase "sort you right out" is a bit slangy, but I need to see the context.

The sentence is instructing someone to get these tablets, which might be for pain relief. However, codeine is often in combination with paracetamol in over-the-counter medications, but if it's in a form that's misused, like for recreational purposes, that's a problem. But the user is just saying to get them, which could be for legitimate use. However, the phrase "sort you right out" might imply that they are using it for something more than just pain, maybe as a sedative or for a different purpose. 

Wait, codeine is a controlled substance, and in some countries, it's illegal to sell or distribute without a prescription. The content is encouraging someone to get these tablets, which could be seen as promoting their use, especially if they're not prescribed. The mention of codeine and paracetamol together might be a red flag for misuse. The phrase "sort you right out" is a bit vague but could be slang for getting high or using it in a way that's not intended. 

So, the key points here are the mention of codeine (a controlled substance) and the context of getting the tablets, which might be promoting their use. The explanation should note that codeine is an illicit drug and the context of obtaining it without medical supervision. Therefore, this would be classified as True.
