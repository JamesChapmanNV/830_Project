Okay, let's tackle this. The content is "And I'm sippin on that codeine not Brandy ðŸ˜›". First, I need to check if it's about illicit or abusive drug use. The user is mentioning "codeine", which is a controlled substance. The phrase "sippin on that codeine" sounds like they're consuming it, possibly in a recreational way. The mention of "not Brandy" might be a slang reference, but the key part is the codeine. Since codeine is an opioid and can be misused, this seems like abuse. The tone is casual and possibly approving. So the label should be True. The explanation would note the mention of codeine in a context suggesting use, possibly recreational.
