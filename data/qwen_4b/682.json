Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet: "whaaat? endorphins are peptides? i thought they would look like morphine". I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT.

First, I'll recall the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs, RX, OTC in abuse contexts, slang, or encouraging misuse. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts.

The content here is a question about endorphins being peptides and comparing them to morphine. Endorphins are natural opioids, but they're not illegal. The user is asking a question in an educational context, maybe in a study group or class. The mention of morphine is a comparison, but morphine is a controlled substance, but the context here is about understanding endorphins, not misuse. There's no indication of promoting abuse or illegal use. The tone is curious and informative, not encouraging or glorifying drug use. So this should be classified as False. The explanation would note the educational context and lack of promotion of misuse.
