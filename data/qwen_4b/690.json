Okay, let's tackle this. The content is "Pour codeine on her 😋💦, It taste like Tahitian 🤘🏾😈". First, I need to check if it's mentioning illegal or abused drugs. Codeine is a controlled substance, so that's a red flag. The context here is very suggestive and uses slang like "pour codeine on her" which sounds like a recreational or abusive use. The emojis and the tone seem to be encouraging or glorifying the use. There's no mention of medical use here. The mention of "Tahitian" might be a cultural reference, but the main point is the codeine use. So, according to the definitions, this would be classified as True because it's about abuse and using slang in a promoting way.
