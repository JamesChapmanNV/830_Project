Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about recreational marijuana being legal for 21+ in New Jersey with certain limits. The user mentions purchasing up to an ounce without a medical card. The hashtag #420day is a reference to cannabis culture. The key points here are the legal sale of marijuana for recreational use, which is allowed in New Jersey. The mention of purchasing and the cultural reference don't indicate abuse or illegal activity. Instead, it's about legal access and celebration of the holiday. So, the context is legal and not promoting abuse. Therefore, it's not illicit.
