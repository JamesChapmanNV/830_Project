Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "If you don't like codeine crazy by future your not a true fan. I can't never skip that song." 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal or abused drugs. The word "codeine" is mentioned. Codeine is a controlled substance, often used in medications, but it's also a drug that can be misused. The phrase "crazy by future" might be a reference to a song or a cultural reference. The user is saying that not liking the song means they're not a true fan, which seems like a personal opinion. 

But wait, the context here is about liking a song. The user is talking about their preference for a song that includes codeine. The key is whether this is promoting or glorifying drug use. The phrase "codeine crazy" could be a slang term or a cultural reference. However, the user is expressing that not liking the song is a sign of not being a fan, which might be more about the song's popularity rather than drug use. 

But codeine is a drug, and if the song is about using it, then it might be considered as promoting drug use. However, the user isn't explicitly talking about using codeine. They're talking about liking a song that's "crazy" because of codeine. The context here is more about the song's appeal rather than drug abuse. 

But the mention of codeine in the song could be a reference to the drug, and the user is expressing a preference for that song, which might be seen as associating with codeine. However, the example given in the task includes codeine in a context that's considered illicit. But in the example, the explanation was that "hooked" and "everyday" with an approving tone. 

In this case, the user is saying that not liking the song means they're not a true fan. It's more about the song's popularity, but the mention of codeine might be a red flag. However, the user isn't explicitly promoting the use of codeine. They're just talking about their preference for a song that includes codeine. 

Alternatively, maybe "codeine crazy" is a slang term for using codeine. If that's the case, then the content could be considered as glorifying the use of codeine. But without more context, it's a bit tricky. 

Looking at the definitions, True includes mentions of illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The user is talking about a song that's "crazy" because of codeine. If the song is about using codeine, then it's promoting drug use. But the user isn't explicitly saying they use it, just that they like the song. 

However, the example given in the task where codeine was mentioned in a context of being hooked and everyday, which was considered True. So in this case, the user is associating with codeine in a way that might be seen as promoting it. But the explanation here is more about the song's popularity. 

Alternatively, maybe "codeine crazy" is a reference to a song title, and the user is just expressing a preference. But the mention of codeine in the song could be a cultural reference that's related to drug use. 

I think the key here is that codeine is a controlled substance, and the user is talking about a song that includes codeine, which might be seen as promoting or glorifying its use. Therefore, the label should be True.

    "label": "True",
    "explanation": "The content mentions 'codeine' in a context that implies association with its use ('crazy'), potentially glorifying or normalizing its recreational or excessive consumption."
