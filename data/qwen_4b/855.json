Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a message that says: "My former Pot Dealer. Started selling guns and ripping people off recently. Stole my money, but I hope the $140 was worth the Karma. Sucks to be him." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key here is to look for any mention of drugs in a context of abuse, misuse, or promotion. The term "Pot Dealer" is a direct reference to someone selling marijuana, which is illegal in many places. The user is talking about their former dealer, who is now involved in selling guns and stealing money. The mention of "Pot Dealer" is a clear indicator of drug-related activity.

However, the context here is more about the dealer's criminal activities, like selling guns and stealing money. The user is expressing a negative sentiment towards the dealer, mentioning that the $140 was worth the Karma. But the main point is the reference to the dealer's role in selling marijuana. Even though the content is about the dealer's criminal behavior, the mention of "Pot Dealer" directly relates to drug dealing, which is illicit. 

The example given in the task includes "lean" and "codeine" as drug terms, so in this case, "Pot Dealer" is a clear indicator. The user is talking about someone who was a dealer, which is a form of drug abuse or illegal activity. Even though the content is more about the dealer's other crimes, the mention of the dealer's role in selling drugs is enough to classify it as illicit. 

I should check if there's any other context that might make this not illicit. But the key terms here are "Pot Dealer," which is a direct reference to drug dealing. The user is not promoting or encouraging drug use but is instead talking about a former dealer's criminal activities. However, the presence of the term "Pot Dealer" still falls under illicit drug-related content because it's about selling drugs, which is illegal. 

So the label should be True because the content mentions a person involved in drug dealing, which is an illicit activity. The explanation should note the mention of "Pot Dealer" indicating drug-related abuse or illegal activity.
