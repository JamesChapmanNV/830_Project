Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a content snippet: "Put codeine on salad, guess I'm on a codeine salad." I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. 

First, I'll check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal or OTC drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promoting. Also, slang or euphemisms that indicate recreational use. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts.

The content mentions "codeine," which is an opioid, and the phrase "codeine salad" seems like a slang or euphemism. The user is saying they're "on a codeine salad," which sounds like they're using codeine recreationally. The use of "salad" here is probably a slang term, not a literal food item. 

The example given in the first example used "lean" and "codeine" with a supportive tone, which was classified as True. Similarly, this content uses codeine in a way that suggests recreational use, possibly in a slang context. The phrase "on a codeine salad" is likely a metaphor for using codeine, which is an illicit drug. 

So, based on the definitions, this should be classified as True because it's using codeine in a context that implies recreational use, possibly through slang. The explanation should mention the mention of codeine and the slang-like phrase indicating abuse.
