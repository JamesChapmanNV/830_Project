Okay, let's tackle this content: "How am I still awake after many doses of codeine, a Benadryl & 3 bowls." First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. 

The user mentions "codeine," which is a controlled substance, and they're talking about taking "many doses." That could indicate misuse. Also, "Benadryl" is an OTC drug, but combining it with codeine might be dangerous. The phrase "3 bowls" is a bit unclear, but in slang, "bowls" can refer to doses of drugs, like "a bowl" of meth or something similar. 

The context here is someone talking about their experience with codeine and Benadryl, possibly in a way that suggests they're using them in combination, which could be risky. The tone seems to be about the effects of the drugs, which might imply misuse or abuse. 

I should check if there's any indication of promoting or encouraging use. The user is describing their own experience, which might not be directly promoting, but the mention of multiple doses of codeine, which is a controlled substance, could fall under abuse. Also, the use of Benadryl with codeine might be a dangerous combination, which could be a sign of misuse. 

Since codeine is an illegal drug in some contexts and the user is taking multiple doses, this seems like it's related to abuse. The mention of "3 bowls" might be a slang term for doses, which adds to the suspicion. Therefore, this content would be classified as True.
