Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about a book by Mark Lanegan that's 300+ pages on him scoring heroin or crack and 25 pages on music. The user says it's tragic and not recommended for those who like him.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drug use in a way that's illicit or abusive. The book is described as covering him scoring heroin or crack. "Scoring" drugs is a slang term for dealing or distributing them, which is illegal. The context here is that the book is about his drug use, which is part of his life story. The user also mentions it's tragic and not recommended, which might imply that the content is discussing the negative aspects of drug use, but the key is whether it's promoting or glorifying abuse.

The definitions say True includes mentions of illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse, using slang, or encouraging it. The content here is about a book that details his drug use, which is a personal account of abuse. The term "scoring" is a clear indicator of drug dealing, which is illegal. Even though the user says it's not recommended, the content itself is discussing the drug use, which falls under the category of illicit drug-related content. So the label should be True.
