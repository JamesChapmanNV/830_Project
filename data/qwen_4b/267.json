Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a social media post that includes several hashtags and mentions of drugs. The content is: "#NCB found someone's #son but why would is surprised as #wife is a full high all time and #dealer big fish ðŸŽ£ and #NCB staff ðŸ¤³ with celebrity".

First, I need to break down the elements. The hashtags include #NCB (National Child Protection), #son, #wife, #high, #dealer, and #NCB staff. The mention of "full high all time" suggests ongoing drug use, possibly methamphetamine or another stimulant. The term "dealer" indicates involvement in drug distribution. The context here seems to be about someone being a drug user and a dealer, which could be related to drug abuse or misuse. The use of "full high" is a slang term for being under the influence of drugs, which is a clear indicator of recreational drug use. The content also mentions a "dealer," which is associated with illegal drug activities. The overall tone seems to be describing a situation where someone is involved in drug use and dealing, which fits the definition of illicit or abusive drug-related content. There's no mention of medical or educational context here, so it's not in a legitimate health discussion. Therefore, the classification should be True.
