Okay, let's tackle this. The content mentions George Floyd having 11ng/ml of fentanyl in his blood and compares it to the recommended dosage for anesthesia. The user is pointing out that he didn't overdose. The key here is the context. The user is discussing a medical aspect of fentanyl in a legal or public context, not promoting or glorifying its use. They're providing factual information about the drug levels, not encouraging abuse. So, it's not about misuse or promotion. The terms are used in a medical or educational context, so it should be classified as False.
