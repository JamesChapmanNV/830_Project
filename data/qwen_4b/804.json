Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "Baby I can't quit that lean, put a ring all-round codeine." 

First, I need to identify if there's any mention of drugs. "Lean" is a slang term for a type of crack cocaine, right? And "codeine" is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. The phrases "can't quit" and "put a ring all-round" suggest a habitual use, maybe even addiction. The tone seems supportive and approving, which aligns with promoting or glorifying drug use.

Looking at the definitions, True includes mentions of illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The user is talking about not being able to quit, which implies addiction. The use of slang and the supportive tone fit the criteria for ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED. So the label should be True.
