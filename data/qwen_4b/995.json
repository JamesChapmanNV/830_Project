Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "Of the molly and codeine that's my medication i just killed my first rapper it's a celebration ;b". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal or abused drugs. "Molly" is a slang term for MDMA, which is a controlled substance. Codeine is an opioid, often used in medications but also misused. The user says "that's my medication," which might imply they're using it as a drug, not for its intended medical purpose. 

Then there's "killed my first rapper" which is a bit confusing. Maybe it's a metaphor or a reference to something else, but the context here is about drug use. The phrase "it's a celebration" suggests a positive or glorifying attitude towards the drug use. 

The user is talking about using molly and codeine, which are both substances that can be abused. The mention of "killed my first rapper" could be a euphemism or a reference to a different context, but combined with the other terms, it's likely referring to drug use. The overall tone seems to be about using these drugs, which is abusive. 

So, based on the definitions, this would be classified as True because it mentions drugs (molly, codeine) in a context that seems to involve abuse or misuse, and the tone is celebratory, which glorifies the use.
