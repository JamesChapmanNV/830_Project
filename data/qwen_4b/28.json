Okay, let's see. The user provided a content snippet that says: "oooh i'm still learning their names, but i think go eun, ireh, and swan are potential biases!! and dosie rly stood out to me in the overdose cover (WHICH WAS SO GOOD)! who's yours?? :)" 

First, I need to determine if this content is related to illicit or abusive drug use. The key here is to check for any mention of drugs, slang, or contexts that indicate abuse or misuse.

Looking at the content, the user mentions "go eun, ireh, and swan" which I recognize as slang terms for drugs. "Go eun" is a term used in some contexts to refer to methamphetamine, and "ireh" is another slang term for meth. "Swan" is also a slang term for a type of drug, often associated with meth or other stimulants. The user is talking about these terms in the context of "potential biases," which might refer to drug use or addiction. 

Additionally, the mention of "overdose cover" could be related to drug use, but the main focus here is on the slang terms. The user is discussing these terms in a way that seems to be about identifying or discussing drug use, which could be seen as promoting or discussing drug abuse. However, the context is more about learning the terms and discussing their use in media, which might not be directly promoting abuse but could still be considered related to drug abuse.

The example given in the task includes content that mentions slang terms and uses them in a context that implies recreational use. In this case, the user is talking about these terms in a casual, possibly informative way, but the terms themselves are associated with drug abuse. Therefore, the content would be classified as ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED.
