Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about two illegal immigrants smuggling $700K in heroin. The key points here are the mention of heroin, which is an illegal drug, and the context of smuggling, which implies illegal activity. The authorities are involved, so it's a law enforcement matter. The content is reporting on the smuggling of a large quantity of heroin, which is clearly related to illicit drug trafficking. Since the focus is on the illegal transportation of a controlled substance, this falls under illicit drug-related content. The explanation should note the mention of heroin and the context of smuggling, which indicates illegal drug trafficking. So the label should be True.

    "label": "True",
