Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "Source? Cuz everything I read says he had a heart attack because of an overdose. Which means the overdose killed him." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The user is talking about an overdose leading to a heart attack and death. The key here is the context. The mention of an overdose is a serious medical issue, but the question is whether it's promoting or glorifying drug use.

The content doesn't mention any specific drugs, just refers to an overdose in general. The user is seeking a source for information, not promoting drug use. The explanation is about the cause of death, which is a medical context. There's no indication of encouraging or glorifying drug abuse. The terms used are related to a medical event, not misuse or abuse. So, this should be classified as False because it's discussing a medical consequence of overdose, not promoting or encouraging drug use.
