Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about someone defending Demi Lovato, who's known for her struggles with substance abuse, including overdose incidents. The user is saying that Lovato uses her struggles as a marketing tactic and romanticizes drug use in her music. 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key points here are the mention of overdose and drug use in her music. The user is criticizing her for using these as a marketing strategy, which implies that the content is discussing her drug use in a negative light. However, the task is to check if the content is promoting or glorifying drug abuse.

But wait, the user isn't promoting drug use; they're pointing out that she's using her past issues for marketing. The content here is more about criticizing her behavior rather than encouraging or glorifying drug use. The terms "overdose" and "marketing tactic" are mentioned, but the context is about her using it for publicity, not promoting abuse. 

So, the content is discussing drug-related issues but in a critical context, not promoting or glorifying. Therefore, it's not illicit or abusive. The answer should be False. The explanation would note that the content critiques her use of drug-related topics for marketing, not promoting abuse.
