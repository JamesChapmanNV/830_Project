Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "Denver's first 'equity' cannabis store went to a white guy from Wyoming Lol". The user wants to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED (True) or NOT (False). 

First, I need to check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal, RX, or OTC drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promoting use. Also, slang, euphemisms, or cultural references indicating recreational use or abuse. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts, or drug terms in unrelated contexts.

The content mentions "cannabis store". Now, cannabis is legal in Colorado, where Denver is located. But the key here is the context. The phrase "equity" might refer to a business model, like ensuring fair access or community benefits. The mention of a "white guy from Wyoming" could be a cultural reference, maybe implying something about the store's ownership or a joke. The "Lol" at the end is just a reaction.

But wait, the store is a cannabis store. However, the content doesn't mention any abuse, misuse, or promotion of drug use. It's talking about a store's ownership. The term "equity" here is likely related to business practices, not drug abuse. The user might be making a joke about the store's owner, but there's no indication of drug-related abuse or promotion. 

So, since it's about a cannabis store in a legal context, and there's no mention of abuse, misuse, or promotion, it's more likely False. The terms are related to a business, not drug abuse. The "Lol" is just a reaction, not indicating any illicit activity. Therefore, the classification should be False.
