Okay, let's see. The content here is "LOL, at  says on Brokerage - 'Wiggy Makes Money - No1 Else!'". Hmm, first, I need to figure out what "Wiggy" refers to. Maybe it's a slang term or a nickname. The user is asking if this is related to illicit or abusive drugs.

Looking at the example given, the first example mentions "lean" and "codeine," which are drugs, and the explanation was about abuse. The second example was about a pharmacology lecture, which is educational and thus not illicit.

In this case, the content is about a brokerage and mentions "Wiggy Makes Money - No1 Else!" The term "Wiggy" isn't a drug term I recognize. It could be a brand name, a person's name, or a slang term. But the context here is a brokerage, so it's about making money. The phrase "Makes Money - No1 Else!" is positive and about financial success. There's no mention of drugs, illegal activities, or anything related to abuse. The user might be referring to a stock or investment, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the key is that there's no indication of drug-related content here. The terms used are financial, not related to drugs. So the classification should be False.
