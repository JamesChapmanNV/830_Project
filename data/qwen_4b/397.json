Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "Drinking hasn't been doing it for me lately maybe I'll start doing heroin." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The user is talking about switching from drinking to heroin. Heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance, illegal and highly addictive. The mention of heroin in this context suggests a potential for abuse or misuse. The phrase "maybe I'll start doing heroin" implies a consideration of using a dangerous drug, which could be seen as encouraging or glorifying drug misuse.

But wait, the user is talking about switching from alcohol to heroin. Is there a medical context here? The example given in the task had a pharmacology lecture which was considered false because it was educational. However, this content isn't in an educational setting. The user is expressing a personal decision to use heroin, which is a clear indication of drug abuse. 

Also, the use of "doing heroin" is a direct reference to using the drug, which falls under the definition of illicit drug-related content. The context here is about misuse, not medical use. Therefore, the label should be True.
