Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is about the Narcotics Control Bureau seizing heroin and other drugs. The user wants to know if this is illicit or not. 

First, I need to check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse or misuse, slang, or encouragement. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts.

The content here is reporting on a seizure operation. It mentions heroin and other drugs, but the context is about law enforcement action, not promoting or encouraging misuse. The hashtags like #DRUGS and #drugsareforbidden might be part of the public announcement. There's no mention of abuse, use, or promotion. It's a news report on drug seizure, so it's in a legal or law enforcement context. Therefore, it's not promoting abuse. So the label should be False.
