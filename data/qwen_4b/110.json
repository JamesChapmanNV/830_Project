Okay, let's see. The user provided a content snippet where someone is ranking their favorite EXO albums. The albums listed include "overdose" and "dmumt". Now, I need to determine if this content is illicit or abusive drug-related.

First, I should check if there are any direct mentions of drugs. The album names "overdose" and "dmumt" (which might be a typo for "D.M. Untold" or something similar) could be tricky. "Overdose" is a term that's commonly used in music to refer to a song title, but it's also a term related to drug use. However, in this context, it's part of an album title, which is a cultural reference. The user is talking about music rankings, not discussing drug use. 

The explanation part should mention that while "overdose" is a term that could be associated with drug use, the context here is a music ranking. There's no indication of promoting or discussing drug abuse. The user is just sharing their opinion on music, so it's not related to illicit drugs. Therefore, the classification should be False.
