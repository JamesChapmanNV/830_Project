Okay, let's tackle this. The content is "HOW TO CRACK JEE IN 1 MONTH | 100% SELECTION GUARANTEED". First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs or drug-related terms. The keywords here are "JEE", which is an exam in India, and "crack" as in passing the exam. The phrase "100% selection guaranteed" sounds like a promise of success. There's no mention of drugs, illegal substances, or anything related to drug abuse. The context is about academic success, not drugs. So according to the definitions, since there's no drug-related content, it should be classified as False. The explanation would note that the content is about an exam and doesn't involve drugs or their misuse.

    "label": "False",
    "explanation": "The content discusses an academic exam strategy and does not mention or imply drug-related activity or abuse."
