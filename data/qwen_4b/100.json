Okay, let's see. The content is "That he scored more coke from his dealer." I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related.

First, "coke" is a slang term for cocaine, which is an illegal drug. The phrase "scored more" implies getting more of the drug, which is associated with drug use. The mention of a dealer suggests buying or obtaining the drug, which is part of the drug abuse context. The sentence doesn't seem to be in a medical or educational context. It's talking about someone getting more cocaine, which is recreational or abusive. So according to the definitions, this should be classified as True. The explanation should mention the slang term and the context of obtaining the drug from a dealer.
