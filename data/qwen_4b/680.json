Okay, let's tackle this content: "i didn't know how much crack you have to smoke in order to say harry maguire was fantasticâ€¦". First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The user is talking about crack, which is an illegal drug. The context here is someone trying to figure out how much crack is needed to comment on Harry Maguire's performance in a positive way. That seems like a joke or a sarcastic comment, but the mention of crack is illegal. The key points are the mention of an illegal drug and the context of using it. Even though the comment is about a sports player, the drug reference is still illicit. The user is asking about the quantity needed to say something about a person, which might be a humorous or exaggerated way to talk about drug use. Since it's mentioning an illegal drug and the context of use, even if it's in a joke, it's still classified as illicit. So the label should be True.
