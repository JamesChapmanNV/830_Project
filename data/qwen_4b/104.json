Okay, let's tackle this content: "I just read somebody post said DMX didn't overdose it was the covid vaccine." First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The user is talking about DMX, who is a rapper, and someone's post claiming he didn't overdose but rather the COVID vaccine. 

Wait, DMX is a musician known for his work in hip-hop. The mention of overdose here is probably in a context of a drug-related incident. But the user is saying that the cause was the COVID vaccine, which is a medical context. However, the original content is about a post that claims DMX's death was due to the vaccine, not drug abuse.

But the task is to check if the content is related to illicit or abusive drugs. The key here is whether the content is promoting, discussing, or glorifying drug use. The user is reporting on someone else's post, which is about a possible cause of DMX's death. However, the content doesn't mention any drugs in a way that suggests abuse or misuse. Instead, it's discussing a medical event (vaccine) and a person's death. 

The term "overdose" is used, but the context here is a medical incident, not drug abuse. The user is not promoting drug use, but rather discussing a post that attributes a death to a vaccine. Since the content is about a medical cause and not about drugs being used abusively, it's more of a medical or health-related discussion. Therefore, it doesn't fit the criteria for illicit/abusive drug-related content. So the label should be False.
