Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "Hundreds get card for clinical cannabis, even while it's not for sale in #Missouri nevertheless." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key terms here are "clinical cannabis" and "not for sale in Missouri." Clinical cannabis might refer to medical use, but the mention of a card could imply some form of access. However, the user is asking about abuse or misuse. 

The phrase "not for sale in Missouri" might be a bit confusing. Wait, Missouri actually does have some medical cannabis programs, but the statement says it's not for sale there. Maybe the user is referring to a specific context where it's not available. But the main point is whether this content is promoting or discussing drug abuse.

The content mentions "clinical cannabis," which is typically used in a medical context. The fact that it's not for sale in Missouri might be a point of confusion, but the key is that it's about getting a card for clinical use. The user is not promoting abuse or misuse here. Instead, it's discussing a medical application. 

Also, the hashtag #Missouri might be pointing out a discrepancy, but the main content is about clinical use. Since there's no mention of abuse, promotion, or misuse, this should be classified as False. The explanation should note that it's in a medical context, not promoting abuse.
