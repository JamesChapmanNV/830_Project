Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a content snippet: "just found out cheese addiction is very real because cheese has morphine like compounds wtf". I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT.

First, I'll check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in abuse contexts, slang, or encouraging misuse. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts. 

The content mentions "cheese has morphine-like compounds". Morphine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. But the context here is cheese, which is a food item. The user is talking about cheese addiction, which is a humorous or exaggerated statement. They're not promoting or encouraging the use of morphine or any illegal drugs. Instead, they're making a joke about cheese having morphine-like compounds, which is a misunderstanding or a meme. 

The key points here are the use of "morphine-like compounds" in a non-medical, possibly humorous context. There's no indication of abuse, promotion, or misuse. The user is expressing surprise or confusion, not encouraging drug use. So this doesn't fit the criteria for True. Therefore, the label should be False.
