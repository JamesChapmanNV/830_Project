Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet that needs classification as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is: "I fully agree. It was my target months ago. Sadly Pfizer bought out the Feds. Like any good dealer you gotta push the stash at hand."

First, I need to check if there are any mentions of illegal drugs, slang, or references to drug abuse. The words "dealer" and "stash" are strong indicators. "Push the stash" is a common slang term for distributing drugs, especially illicit ones. The mention of "Pfizer" might be a red herring, but the context here is about dealing and pushing drugs. The phrase "target months ago" could imply involvement in drug-related activities. The overall tone seems to glorify or encourage drug dealing, which fits the True category. There's no mention of medical use or educational context here. So the classification should be True with an explanation about the slang and encouragement of drug dealing.
