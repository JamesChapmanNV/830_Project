Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet that needs classification as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The example given is about a sister-in-law and her friends drinking wine. First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs, illegal substances, or contexts related to abuse or misuse.

Looking at the content: "My sister-in-law's blonde lives in Lahaina & all her friends are 80% blonde. every photo they're all drinking wine." The key terms here are "drinking wine." Wine is an alcoholic beverage, but the user's task is to identify drug-related content. The definition says True includes mentions of illegal drugs, RX, OTC, or slang related to abuse. However, wine isn't a drug. The context is about social gatherings, not drug use or abuse. There's no mention of any illegal drugs, slang, or promotion of misuse. The explanation in the example for False includes educational contexts, and this is just a description of people drinking wine, which is a normal activity. So, this should be classified as False. The explanation would note that it's about social drinking without any drug-related context.
