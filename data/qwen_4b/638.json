Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about a 205kg heroin haul in Gujarat and an importer from Amritsar being arrested. First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key here is the mention of heroin, which is an illegal drug. The context is about a large quantity being seized and an arrest, which points to illegal activity. The source is a news outlet, but the content itself is reporting on the illegal trafficking of heroin. So, this fits under the True category because it's discussing the illegal drug heroin in the context of its trafficking and arrest. The explanation should mention the mention of heroin and the context of trafficking and arrest.

    "label": "True",
    "explanation": "The content mentions 'heroin,' an illegal drug, and describes a large-scale drug trafficking incident involving an arrest, indicating illicit drug activity."
