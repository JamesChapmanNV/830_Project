Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "#EUPHORIA nahhh ion trust how she pulled that morphine out". First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abuse-related. The hashtag #EUPHORIA suggests a feeling of euphoria, which is often associated with drug use. The mention of "morphine" is a controlled substance, and the phrase "pulled that morphine out" could imply misuse or abuse. The user is expressing distrust, which might indicate they're concerned about the misuse. The context here is about someone using morphine, possibly in a way that's not medical. The slang "pulled that out" might be a euphemism for using or abusing. Since morphine is an illegal drug in many contexts and the tone seems to be about misuse, this would be classified as True.
