Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "THIS MV REALLY LEOT YOONGI'S FULL ON CRACK SELF AND I AM HERE FOR IT THIS MAN IS FUNNIEST MAN ON EARTH PLEASE". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs in a context that's illicit or abusive. The phrase "FULL ON CRACK" is a strong indicator. "Crack" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illegal drug. The user is praising YOONGI for being "FULL ON CRACK," which suggests he's using the drug. The tone is positive and supportive, which aligns with promoting or glorifying drug use. There's no mention of medical use or education here. The context is about a music video and the artist's performance, but the use of "crack" in a positive light indicates abuse or misuse. So, this should be classified as True.
