Okay, let's see. The user provided a content snippet: "wdw pls stop going live at the crack of dawn or while i'm working thank youu ðŸ˜‚". I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. 

First, I'll check if there are any drug-related terms. The words here are "wdw" (which is "wait, what" or "wait, did you"), "crack of dawn" refers to early morning, and "live" in the context of streaming. There's no mention of drugs, illegal substances, or any slang related to drug use. The phrase "crack of dawn" is a time expression, not related to drugs. The user is asking someone to stop going live at a certain time, possibly because it's disruptive. There's no indication of drug abuse, promotion, or misuse here. The tone is casual and polite, not encouraging or glorifying anything. So, based on the definitions, this doesn't fit the True category. The explanation should mention the absence of drug-related terms and the context of time and streaming.
