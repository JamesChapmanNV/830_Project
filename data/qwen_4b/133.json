Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "the morphine shot was cool but all bc we can't see zendaya tittes IM CRYINGGGG #Euphoria". First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs in a way that's illicit or abusive.

Morphine is a controlled substance, so that's a red flag. The user mentions "morphine shot" and uses words like "cool" which might indicate a positive or casual attitude towards its use. However, the context here is a bit confusing. The second part talks about not seeing Zendaya's Tits and crying, which seems unrelated. The hashtag #Euphoria might reference the TV show, but that's not directly related to drug use.

But the key part is "morphine shot was cool". Morphine is a potent opioid, and using it in a casual or positive way could imply misuse or abuse. Even though the rest of the content is about a TV show, the mention of morphine in a positive light might still fall under illicit drug-related content. However, the user might be using it in a non-medical context. The phrase "cool" could be slang for something else, but given that morphine is a drug, and the context isn't medical, it's more likely to be abuse. So the label should be True.
