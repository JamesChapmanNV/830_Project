Okay, let's see. The user provided a content snippet that's a bit confusing. The content starts with "kisuke into the world of the living." Then there's a mention of someone cracking a joke, a hand balling up into a fist, and a line about treating old shopkeepers. The user wants me to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT.

First, I need to check if there are any drug-related terms here. The word "kisuke" might be a name or a term, but I'm not sure. Then there's "gremlin," which is a mythical creature, not a drug. The line about treating old shopkeepers could be a metaphor, but I don't see any drug references. The context seems to be a narrative with some conflict, maybe a joke or a metaphor. There's no mention of drugs, illegal substances, or anything related to abuse or misuse. The terms used don't fit the definitions provided. The example given in the task had specific drug terms like codeine or lean, which are clearly related. In this case, there's no such terminology. So the answer should be False because there's no drug-related content here. The explanation should note the absence of drug terms and the context being unrelated.
