Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify the given content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is a statement about the DuPont Family being responsible for banning cannabis in 1938 and related arrests. 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal drugs or their abuse. The content mentions cannabis, which is a drug. However, the context here is about historical figures and their role in banning cannabis, not about using or promoting it. The user is criticizing the DuPont Family for their historical actions, not discussing drug use or abuse.

The definitions say that True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse or misuse. But here, the content is about the political or historical aspects of cannabis prohibition, not about using or promoting it. The terms used are about banning and arrests, not about recreational use or abuse. 

Also, the example given in the prompt where a pharmacology lecture is considered False because it's educational. Similarly, this content is not promoting drug use but discussing historical events. So, it's more about political or social issues rather than drug abuse. 

Therefore, the classification should be False because it's not about drug abuse or promotion, but rather a statement about historical figures and their actions related to cannabis prohibition.
