Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet: "Everywhere we go we clean, she wants me to quit that lean, baby I can't quit that lean, put a ring around codeineðŸ˜›". I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT.

First, I'll break down the content. The mention of "lean" and "codeine" are key. "Lean" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. "Codeine" is an opioid, often used in medications but also a controlled substance. The phrases "hooked" and "can't quit" suggest dependency or abuse. The tone seems to be about struggling with drug use, which is related to abuse. The user is talking about trying to quit but can't, indicating a problem with drug use. The smiley face might indicate a casual or ironic tone, but the content still refers to drug use in a context of abuse. Since the content mentions specific drugs and the context of use, it falls under the ILLICIT category. The example given in the prompt where "lean" and "codeine" were considered true aligns with this. So the label should be True.

    "label": "True",
    "explanation": "The content uses 'lean' (crack cocaine) and 'codeine' in a context of dependency and struggle, indicating drug abuse."
