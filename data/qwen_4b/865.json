Okay, let's tackle this content. The user is talking about buying drugs from a dealer for 8 months, spending $20 a few times a week. The dealer doesn't give deals if you pay $100, only gives 10g. The user mentions being rude and not going back.

First, I need to check if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The content mentions buying drugs repeatedly, which is a sign of abuse. The dealer's behavior is described as not giving deals unless you pay more, which might indicate a pattern of drug trafficking. The mention of spending a lot of money on drugs regularly points to habitual use, which is abuse. The tone here is about the user's experience with the dealer, which could be part of drug abuse. The terms like "buying" and "spending money" are direct indicators of drug use. Also, the dealer's attitude might be part of the drug trade's dynamics. So, this seems to fit under illicit/abusive drug-related. The explanation should note the repeated purchasing, spending money, and the dealer's behavior as signs of drug abuse.
