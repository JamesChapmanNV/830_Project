Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about a stabbing where the motive was someone being a drug dealer who hid narcotics in fake books. The key here is to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related.

First, the mention of "drug dealer" directly points to illegal drug activity. The person is involved in distributing narcotics, which are illegal. The act of hiding narcotics in fake books is a method of trafficking, which is part of drug abuse or illegal distribution. The context is about a murder linked to drug dealing, which is clearly related to illicit drug activities. 

The example given in the task's definitions includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. Here, the drug dealer is involved in illegal activities, so this would fall under True. The explanation should note the mention of drug dealing and narcotics, indicating illegal drug activity.
