Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "Wiz Khalifa annoys the shit out of me with his 'no blunt' policy but the bitch hops on the codeine train no problem." 

First, I need to check if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The user mentioned codeine, which is a controlled substance. The phrase "hops on the codeine train" is a slang reference to using codeine. The context here is someone criticizing Wiz Khalifa's policy but then saying that someone else uses codeine without a problem. 

The key points are the mention of codeine and the slang "hops on the train," which is a common euphemism for drug use. The tone seems to be approving or at least not condemning the use. Also, codeine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. Since the content is discussing the use of codeine in a way that's not medical or educational but rather in a recreational or casual context, it fits the True category. The example given in the first example also used similar slang, so this should be classified as True.

    "label": "True",
    "explanation": "The content uses 'codeine train' as slang for recreational drug use and implies acceptance of opioid misuse."
