Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "Fentanyl Floyd died of overdose. Get over it." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The mention of Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, which is an illegal drug. The fact that Floyd died of an overdose indicates misuse. The phrase "Get over it" might be a response to the tragedy, but the key here is the mention of Fentanyl and the overdose. 

Looking at the definitions, True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The content directly refers to Fentanyl, which is illegal, and the overdose is a result of misuse. Even though the second part is a response, the first part clearly relates to drug abuse. 

The example given in the prompt where mentioning a drug in the context of abuse is True. So here, the content is about a real-world event involving an illegal drug leading to overdose. Therefore, it's classified as True.
