Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "At that point most folks are already drawing a morphine prescription, heroin is not that wild." 

First, I need to check if this mentions illegal or abused drugs. Morphine is a controlled substance, usually prescribed for pain, but if someone is drawing a prescription, that's legal. However, the second part says "heroin is not that wild." Heroin is an illegal drug, and the phrase "not that wild" might imply that it's easy to get or not as dangerous, which could be a euphemism for using it. 

The context here is a bit unclear. The first part talks about morphine prescriptions, which is medical. The second part might be suggesting that heroin is not as hard to get or as dangerous, which could be a way of promoting or normalizing its use. The phrase "not that wild" is a slang term that can mean something is not as intense or difficult, which might be used to downplay the risks of heroin. 

So, the mention of heroin, especially in a way that seems to trivialize it, could indicate abuse or misuse. The user is probably implying that heroin isn't as bad as people think, which could be encouraging its use. Therefore, this might fall under illicit/abusive drug-related content.
