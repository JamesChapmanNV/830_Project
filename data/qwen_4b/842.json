Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "In any case, I think I'm going to go with White Zombie over Morphine, which will lose me some coolness points but 'Astro-Creep' is almost certainly a Top 20 metal album for me." 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs. The user mentioned "White Zombie" and "Morphine." White Zombie is a band, but Morphine is a drug. Wait, Morphine is an opioid, which is a controlled substance. But the context here is about choosing between two bands. The user is talking about music preferences, not using the drug. The phrase "lose me some coolness points" is about social status, not drug use. There's no indication of abuse, promotion, or misuse. The mention of Morphine is in the context of a band name, not as a drug. So the content is about music, not drug-related abuse. Therefore, it should be classified as False.
