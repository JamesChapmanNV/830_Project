Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify the given content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is: "Says it all with only 4 RT'S Shame for him and his family". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs, illegal substances, or drug abuse. The content mentions "RT'S" which could be a typo for "retweets" or "replies". The phrase "Shame for him and his family" is a bit vague. But there's no explicit mention of drugs, slang, or any context related to drug use. The words "shame" and "family" might be part of a social media comment about someone's actions, but without any drug-related terms, it doesn't fit the criteria for True. 

The definitions say True includes mentions of illegal drugs in abuse contexts, slang, or encouragement of misuse. Here, there's no such mention. The content is more about social media interactions and a comment on someone's actions, not related to drugs. So the label should be False. The explanation would note that there's no drug-related content.

    "label": "False",
    "explanation": "The content does not mention drugs, slang, or contexts related to drug abuse or misuse; it focuses on social media interaction and a general comment about someone's actions."
