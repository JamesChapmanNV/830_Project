Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "bruh does no one notice this guy is wearing a tie dye codeine shirt?" 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key terms here are "codeine" and "tie dye shirt." Codeine is a controlled substance, so mentioning it could be relevant. But the context is someone wearing a shirt with codeine printed on it. The phrase "bruh" is slang, often used in a casual or humorous way, maybe to get attention.

Now, the question is whether this is promoting or glorifying drug use. The user is asking if people notice the shirt, which might be a reference to codeine, but it's not clear if it's about using the drug or just a fashion statement. The term "tie dye" is common in clothing, so the shirt might be a cultural reference rather than a direct mention of drug use. 

Looking at the definitions, True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse or misuse. However, if the content is just referring to a shirt with a drug name on it without any indication of use or promotion, it might fall under False. The example given in the task where a shirt with a drug name was mentioned was classified as False because it was a cultural reference without promoting misuse. 

So, in this case, the content is about someone wearing a shirt with codeine, which is a slang term. The user is asking if people notice, which is more of a social comment rather than promoting drug use. Therefore, the label should be False because it's not encouraging or glorifying drug abuse but rather a reference to clothing with a drug name.
