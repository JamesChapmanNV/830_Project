Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a query that needs classification as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is: "today it was finding out she used a loop of some russian kids supposedly overdosing on heroin for a now deleted music video from Was it weird i listened to "i'm god" by clams Casino when i lost my virginity"

First, I need to break down the content. The key parts here are mentions of heroin, a music video, and a reference to a song. The user is talking about someone using a loop of Russian kids overdosing on heroin in a music video. The mention of heroin is a controlled substance, and overdosing implies misuse or abuse. The context here is about a music video, which might be a reference to a song or a video that's now deleted. The phrase "supposedly overdosing" could be a euphemism or a reference to real events, but the key point is the mention of heroin use in a context that seems to be about a music video, which might be a cultural reference or a metaphor.

Now, applying the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in the context of abuse, misuse, or promoting. The content mentions heroin, which is illegal, and the context of overdosing, which is a misuse. However, the user is talking about a music video that's now deleted. The reference to a song ("i'm god" by Clams Casino) might be a cultural reference, but the main point is the mention of heroin use in a context that's not necessarily promoting it. However, the act of using a loop of someone overdosing could be seen as glorifying or referencing drug abuse. The user also mentions "was it weird" which might indicate a personal reaction, but the key is the mention of heroin and the context of overdose.

Wait, the example given in the problem statement includes "hooked" and "codeine" as indicating abuse. Here, the content is about someone using a loop of a music video that supposedly involves heroin overdose. The mention of heroin is a controlled substance, and the context of overdose is misuse. The user is discussing a music video that's now deleted, which might be a reference to a song or a video that's been removed. The phrase "supposedly overdosing" might be a reference to a real event or a fictional one, but the key is that heroin is mentioned in the context of misuse. 

But the user is not necessarily promoting or encouraging the use of heroin. They are talking about a music video that's now deleted, which might be a cultural reference. However, the mention of heroin and overdose is a clear indicator of drug abuse. The example given in the problem statement includes "lean" and "codeine" as indicators. Here, heroin is mentioned, which is an illicit drug. The context of overdose is a misuse. Therefore, the content would be classified as True because it mentions an illicit drug (heroin) in the context of overdose, which is abuse. The reference to a music video might be a cultural reference, but the key is the mention of heroin and the context of misuse.
