Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet: "You're a good sport Jack. You're not just pulling it off, you're rocking it!" I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. 

First, I'll check if there are any drug-related terms. The words here are "sport," "pulling it off," "rocking it." None of these are drugs or slang related to drugs. The context is about someone doing something well, maybe sports or a performance. There's no mention of illegal drugs, misuse, or any euphemisms. The example given in the task had terms like "lean" and "codeine," which are drug-related. Here, there's no such terminology. The explanation in the example also mentioned the tone being approving. But in this case, the tone is positive but unrelated to drugs. So, the answer should be False because there's no drug mention or context of abuse. The explanation would note that there are no drug-related terms or references to misuse.
