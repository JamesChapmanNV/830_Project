Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet: "Dropped 2 ounces of codeine in my Minute Maid üçá". I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. 

First, I'll check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal, RX, or OTC drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, promoting, etc. Also, slang or cultural references indicating recreational use or abuse. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts.

The content mentions "codeine", which is an OTC drug but also a controlled substance. The phrase "dropped 2 ounces" suggests a large quantity, which is concerning. "In my Minute Maid" might be a slang reference, but more likely, it's a metaphor or a way to describe mixing codeine with a drink. However, the key point is the mention of codeine in a context that implies possession or use. The use of "dropped" could be a euphemism for having or using. Also, the emoji might be a cultural reference, but the main issue is the quantity and the drug itself. Since codeine is a controlled substance and the quantity is large, this seems like abuse or misuse. So the label should be True.
