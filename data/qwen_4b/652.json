Okay, let's see. The user provided a content example: "I loved the Spiderman drug issues... Peter beats up the heroin dealers he caught selling to Harry..." I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. 

First, I should check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promoting it. Also, slang or cultural references that indicate recreational use or abuse. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts, or drug terms in unrelated contexts.

The content mentions "heroin dealers" and "selling to Harry." Heroin is an illegal drug, and the context here is about Spiderman beating up dealers. The mention of heroin is explicit. However, the context is a movie or comic reference. But the key is whether it's promoting abuse or misuse. The sentence seems to be about Spiderman taking action against dealers, which might be more about law enforcement rather than promoting drug use. However, the mention of heroin is a drug-related term. But the example in the problem is about Spiderman's drug issues. The user's example might be a reference to a movie where Spiderman deals with drug-related issues. But the content here is about Spiderman beating up dealers, which is a fictional scenario. However, the presence of "heroin" is a drug term. But the context is not promoting abuse, but rather a fictional scenario where Spiderman is taking action against dealers. The question is whether this is considered illicit. The example given in the problem might be a test case where the content is about a fictional scenario, but the mention of heroin is a drug. However, the user's example in the problem is not explicitly promoting or encouraging drug use. The explanation in the example might be that the content is about a fictional scenario, but the presence of heroin is a drug. However, the definitions state that True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse or misuse. But in this case, the context is not about abuse or misuse, but about a fictional action against dealers. So maybe it's not promoting abuse. Alternatively, the mention of heroin is a drug, but the context is not promoting its use. Therefore, the label might be False. However, the example in the problem is similar to the first example where "lean" and "codeine" are mentioned with a supportive tone. In this case, the content is about Spiderman dealing with drug issues, but the mention of heroin is in a fictional context. The key is whether it's promoting abuse. Since the content is about Spiderman beating up dealers, it's not promoting drug use. Therefore, the label would be False. But I need to be careful. The presence of "heroin" is a drug, but the context is not abuse or misuse. So the answer is False. The explanation would be that the content references a fictional scenario involving heroin, but does not promote or encourage drug abuse.
