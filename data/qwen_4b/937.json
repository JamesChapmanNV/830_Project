Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passe." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key terms here are "junkie" and "heroin." "Junkie" refers to someone addicted to drugs, which is a direct reference to drug abuse. Heroin is an illegal drug. The phrase "so passe" might be a slang way of saying it's not popular anymore, but the mention of being a junkie implies that the person is using heroin, which is an illicit drug. The context here is about someone being a user, which fits the definition of abuse. The user is talking about someone else's addiction, but the mention of heroin and the term junkie clearly points to drug abuse. So the label should be True. The explanation should note the mention of heroin and the term junkie indicating drug abuse.

    "label": "True",
    "explanation": "The content mentions 'heroin' and refers to someone as a 'junkie,' directly indicating drug abuse and illicit drug use."
