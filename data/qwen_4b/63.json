Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "He can't open them. He's got a serious drug problem. We'll be hearing about his death from overdose at some point." 

First, I need to check if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The user mentioned using drug terms in a medical, educational, or preventative context is false. Here, the mention of a "serious drug problem" and "overdose" is a bit concerning. But wait, the key is the context. The sentence is talking about someone's death due to overdose, which is a consequence of drug use. However, is this promoting or glorifying drug abuse? The sentence seems to be a statement about a person's situation, not encouraging or promoting drug use. It's more of a statement about the outcome of drug use. 

But the term "serious drug problem" might be seen as indicating misuse. However, the example given in the task includes a statement that mentions a drug problem and overdose, but the example wasn't labeled as true. Wait, looking back at the examples, the first example was about codeine and leaning, which was true. The second example was a pharmacology lecture, which was false. 

In this case, the content is stating that someone has a drug problem and will die from overdose. The key here is whether it's promoting or glorifying drug use. The sentence is more of a statement about the consequences, not encouraging use. So it's not promoting abuse. Therefore, it's not illicit or abusive. The explanation should be that it's discussing the consequences of drug use, not promoting or encouraging it. Hence, the label would be False.
