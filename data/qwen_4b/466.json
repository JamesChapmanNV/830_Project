Okay, let's tackle this content classification. The user provided the content: "Hit her with no condom had to make her eat a plan b and im sippin on the codeine not brandy." 

First, I need to parse the sentence. The key terms here are "plan b" and "codeine." Plan B is a medication used for emergency contraception, which is a medical context. However, the sentence also mentions "codeine," which is an opioid drug. The phrase "im sippin on the codeine not brandy" suggests the person is consuming codeine, possibly in a way that's not medically supervised.

Now, considering the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal, RX, or OTC drugs in contexts of abuse or misuse. The user is using codeine, which is a controlled substance. The phrase "sippin on" might imply recreational use. Also, the context of "hit her with no condom" and "make her eat a plan b" could be related to sexual activity and contraceptive measures, but the mention of codeine is the key here.

The user is using codeine, which is a controlled substance, and the way it's phrased ("sippin on") might indicate misuse. Even though plan B is a medical term, the combination with codeine in a casual, possibly abusive context could lead to classifying it as illicit. The explanation should note the mention of codeine and the context of misuse.
