Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "Whomever coined the phrase:'Out of the frying pan and into the fire' was on Codeine & tried combatting its costive effects with prune juice." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The key here is to check if the content mentions illegal drugs in a context of abuse or misuse. The phrase "on Codeine" is mentioned. Codeine is a controlled substance, typically used in medications but also has potential for abuse.

The user is referencing the origin of a phrase and the historical context of someone using codeine. The mention of codeine here is in a historical or anecdotal context, not promoting or encouraging its use. The explanation part talks about combating constipation with prune juice, which is a common method to counteract codeine's side effects. 

The content doesn't glorify or encourage the use of codeine. It's more about a historical anecdote. So according to the definitions, True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. However, here the mention of codeine is in a past context, not promoting abuse. Therefore, it's more of a historical reference rather than promoting or encouraging misuse. 

So the label should be False because it's not promoting or encouraging drug misuse. The explanation would note that it's a historical reference without promoting abuse.
