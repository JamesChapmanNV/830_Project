Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "It's been two years and I'm still confused how Codeine Crazy didn't win a Grammy." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The key here is to check for any mention of drugs in a context of abuse, misuse, or promotion. The term "Codeine" is a controlled substance, so that's a red flag. But the context here is a joke about a Grammy win, which is a cultural reference. The user is talking about a song title, "Codeine Crazy," which is a slang term for codeine use. 

The phrase "hooked on codeine" in the example was considered illicit because it implied abuse. Here, the user is expressing confusion about a song not winning an award, which is a humorous or cultural reference. There's no indication of promoting, using, or encouraging misuse. The mention of codeine is in a metaphorical sense related to the song title, not actual drug use. 

So, the explanation should note that while codeine is mentioned, it's in a cultural context without promoting abuse. Therefore, it's not illicit.
