Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about opioid users being amateur medics using street drugs for self-medication due to mental health issues like PTSD. The user mentions fentanyl overdose crisis and becoming "paranedics." 

First, I need to check if it's promoting or glorifying drug use. The mention of "self-medication" and "amateur medics" might indicate misuse. But the context is about mental health and PTSD, which could be a medical reason. However, the use of street drugs for self-medication is a form of abuse. The terms "amateur medics" and "paranedics" might be slang related to drug use.

The example given in the task includes mentions of abuse or misuse. The content here is discussing how people use drugs for mental health issues, which is a form of misuse. The hashtag #fentanyl suggests a dangerous drug. The explanation in the example 1 mentions "hooked" and "codeine" with an approving tone. Here, the tone is more about the consequences and the crisis, but the key is whether it's promoting or glorifying. 

Wait, the user is talking about how these individuals are using drugs as self-medication, which is a form of abuse. The mention of "amateur medics" might be a euphemism or slang for drug users. Also, the context of the fentanyl overdose crisis indicates a serious issue. 

So, the content is discussing drug use in the context of abuse, even though it's in a medical context. The key is that it's about misuse. The answer would be True because it's discussing the abuse of drugs for self-medication, which is illicit. The explanation should note the mention of street drugs and self-medication for mental health issues, which is abuse.
