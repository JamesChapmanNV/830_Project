Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a content snippet: "No shit there was a fucking pandemic going on." I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED (True) or NOT (False).

First, I'll check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs, slang, or contexts of abuse. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts. The content here is about a pandemic, which is a public health crisis, not related to drugs. There's no mention of drugs, slang, or anything related to abuse. The words "fucking" are vulgar but not related to drugs. The pandemic is a general statement, so it's not promoting or discussing drug use. Therefore, it's False. The explanation should note that the content is about a pandemic, not drug-related.
