Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet and wants me to classify it as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is: "Honestly I found it strange that it was a drug overdose since he's been clean for years now, it's pretty infuriating to see that his ATTORNEY wouldn't fact check that before releasing info."

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs in the context of abuse, misuse, or promotion. The user mentioned "drug overdose," but the context here is someone who's been clean for years. The speaker is reacting to an overdose that occurred despite the person being clean. The key here is the context. The content is discussing a situation where a person had an overdose, but the speaker is pointing out that the person has been clean, which might imply that the overdose was a mistake or an error. 

The term "drug overdose" is mentioned, but the overall context is about a legal or factual issue regarding the release of information by an attorney. There's no indication of promoting, using, or abusing drugs. The mention of "drug" here is in a medical or legal context, not in a way that suggests recreational use or encouragement of misuse. The speaker is expressing frustration about the attorney's actions, not about drug use.

Looking at the definitions, True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. Here, the mention of "drug overdose" is part of a discussion about a legal case, not about drug abuse. The content doesn't encourage or glorify drug misuse. Therefore, it's more aligned with False, as it's in a medical or legal context without promoting misuse. The terms are used in a factual or critical manner, not in a way that suggests recreational use or abuse.
