Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify the content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content given is: "Can you do a list of the WRs Lamar gonna be throwin to wit that 'wall'". 

First, I need to understand what the content is about. The mention of "WRs" could stand for "Wide Receivers" in sports, maybe referring to a football player like Lamar Jackson. "Throwin to wit that 'wall'" might be a reference to a play or a term in sports, possibly a play called a "wall" in football. 

Now, checking the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promotion. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts. The content here doesn't mention any drugs at all. The terms "WRs" and "wall" are likely sports-related slang, not drug-related. There's no indication of drug use, abuse, or promotion. The user is asking for a list of players, which is unrelated to drugs. 

So, the explanation should state that there's no drug mention, just sports terminology. Therefore, the label is False.
