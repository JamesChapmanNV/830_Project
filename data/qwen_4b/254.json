Okay, let's tackle this. The content is asking about Johnny Depp's use of heroin and opioids for continuity. The user is referencing his past drug use. The key here is to determine if this is about abuse or misuse. The question is more about his personal history and how it's used in his role, not promoting or encouraging drug use. It's a cultural reference, not glorifying or encouraging abuse. So the label should be False. The explanation should note that it's a cultural reference without promoting misuse.

    "label": "False",
    "explanation": "The content references Johnny Depp's past drug use in a cultural context, not promoting or glorifying abuse or misuse."
