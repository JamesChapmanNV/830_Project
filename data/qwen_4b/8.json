Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "First one and the third one the best. Love the actress that playes the """drug dealer""" one in the first and third." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The key here is the mention of "drug dealer." The user is talking about an actress playing a drug dealer in movies. The context here is a movie review or commentary, not promoting or encouraging drug use. The term "drug dealer" is part of a role in a film, which is a fictional context. There's no indication of abuse, misuse, or promotion of drugs. The user is just expressing a preference for the actress in that role. So, the content is about a movie character, not about drug use. Therefore, it's not illicit. The answer should be False.
