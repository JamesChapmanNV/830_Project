Okay, let's tackle this content. The user is talking about "TRVN" and mentions an FDA-approved opioid to replace morphine. They're waiting for the DEA number and talking about patience. First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal or abused drugs. TRVN might be a slang term, but I'm not sure. Wait, TRVN could be a typo or a specific term. But the user also mentions an FDA-approved opioid, which is a legal drug. However, the context is about replacing morphine, which is a controlled substance. The mention of DEA number suggests it's a controlled substance. The user is waiting for approval, which might be related to legal processes. The phrase "having to test my patience" might be a euphemism for something else, but the key is whether it's promoting or discussing abuse. The content seems to be about a new opioid in development, not necessarily misuse. The user is waiting for regulatory approval, so it's more about the drug's legal status rather than abuse. Since it's FDA-approved and the context is about regulatory steps, it's not promoting abuse. So the label should be False.
