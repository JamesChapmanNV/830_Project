Okay, let's tackle this. The content is talking about products labeled "rosin-enhanced" and mentions that they're made with frozen cannabis and dried trim. Then it contrasts that with Wana Spectrum gummies made from frozen plant matter, preserving active cannabinoids and terpenes.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal or abusive drugs. The terms used here are "rosin," "cannabis," and "cannabinoids." Rosin is a resin from cannabis plants, which is a natural product. The mention of frozen cannabis and dried trim might be related to cannabis products, but the key is whether they're being used in a way that's illegal or abusive.

The content is explaining the ingredients and methods of making these products, emphasizing preservation of active compounds. There's no mention of misuse, abuse, or promoting drug use. It's more about product composition and benefits. The term "living state" might refer to the freshness or potency, but that's in a medical or educational context, not promoting abuse.

Since there's no indication of illegal drug use, promotion of abuse, or slang related to drugs, this should be classified as NOT ILLICIT. The explanation would focus on the educational or product description aspect without any abusive context.
