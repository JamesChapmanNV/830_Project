Okay, let's tackle this. The content is talking about a Halloween urban legend where people put drugs in sweets, specifically mentioning heroin gummy bears. The user is pointing out that making heroin gummy bears is a hassle and not worth it.

First, I need to check if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The mention of heroin is illegal, but the context here is a legend or a warning. The user is cautioning against it, saying it's not worth it. The key here is whether the content is promoting or glorifying drug use. 

The example given in the task mentions that True includes content that encourages or glorifies misuse. However, in this case, the content is actually warning against the idea, suggesting it's not a good idea. So the tone is discouraging. 

Also, the terms "heroin gummy bears" are a slang reference, but the context is a cautionary tale. The user is not promoting drug use but rather highlighting the impracticality. Therefore, it's not encouraging abuse. 

So the classification should be False because it's discussing a harmful practice but in a context that's warning against it, not promoting or glorifying drug use. The explanation should note the cautionary tone and the mention of heroin in a non-promoting context.
