Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "For suicides, the 20% increase in overdose deaths might be masking the real numbers." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The key is to check if it mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse, misuse, or promotion. The sentence talks about overdose deaths increasing, which could relate to drug use. But the context here is about suicides and overdose deaths being a mask for real numbers. 

The terms used are "overdose deaths," which is a medical or statistical term. The mention of overdose could be related to drug abuse, but the sentence doesn't explicitly name any specific drugs or discuss their misuse. It's more about statistics and the relationship between suicide and overdose rates. 

The definitions say that True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. Here, the content doesn't specifically mention any drugs, just overdose deaths. Overdose can be a result of drug abuse, but the sentence is more about statistical correlation rather than promoting or discussing drug use. 

Also, the example given in the False category includes educational contexts, like pharmacology lectures. This sentence is about statistics and possible masking of numbers, which is more of a public health or statistical analysis rather than promoting drug use. 

So, the explanation would be that it's discussing overdose deaths in a statistical context without promoting or mentioning drug abuse. Therefore, it's False.
