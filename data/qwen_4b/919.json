Okay, let's tackle this content classification. The user provided the content: "'Heroin-coated yarn': How traffickers smuggled â‚¹450 cr worth heroin into India". I need to determine if this is ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED (True) or NOT (False).

First, I'll recall the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promotion. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts. The content here is about how traffickers smuggled heroin into India. The key words here are "heroin" and "smuggled". Heroin is an illegal drug, and the context is about trafficking, which is related to the distribution and smuggling of illicit drugs. The term "traffickers" indicates involvement in illegal drug trade. The content is reporting on a method used to transport a large amount of heroin, which is clearly related to the illicit drug trade. There's no mention of medical use, education, or prevention here. The focus is on the illegal activity of smuggling, which falls under the abuse or misuse context. Therefore, this should be classified as True.
