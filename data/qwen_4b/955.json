Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about scientists cracking a 60-year mystery related to fast magnetic explosions. The key here is to check if there's any mention of drugs, illegal substances, or anything related to abuse. The words "magnetic explosions" and "NASA's MMS Mission" don't relate to drugs. There's no slang, euphemisms, or context suggesting recreational use or promotion of drugs. It's a scientific discovery, so it's in an educational or medical context. Therefore, it's not illicit or abusive drug-related.
