Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify the given content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is: "I heard that used to add a pinch of pure black tar heroin to every bottle. Some say they still do. Could be worth'time to dig into this."

First, I need to check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promotion. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts.

The content mentions "black tar heroin," which is definitely an illicit drug. The phrase "add a pinch" suggests using it, which is abuse. The mention of "used to add" implies that someone is using it in a harmful way. Also, the last part "Could be worth'time to dig into this" might be a typo, but the context is about something potentially harmful. The tone seems to be suggesting that this practice might be real, which could be encouraging or promoting the use. So, this fits under True because it's talking about using heroin, which is illegal and related to abuse. The explanation should note the mention of heroin, the context of adding it to bottles, and the implication of it being a real practice, which could be promoting or encouraging misuse.
