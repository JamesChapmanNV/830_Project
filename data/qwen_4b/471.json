Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "She want me to quit that lean, baby I can't quit that lean, put a üíç around codeine." 

First, I need to identify if there's any mention of drugs related to abuse or misuse. The words "lean" and "codeine" are key here. "Lean" is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illicit drug. "Codeine" is an opioid, often used in medications but also a controlled substance. The phrases "hooked" and "can't quit" suggest addiction and struggle with drug use. The mention of "put a üíç around codeine" might be a reference to a relationship or a euphemistic way of saying something, but the context of wanting to quit and the mention of codeine points towards drug abuse.

The tone seems to be about struggling with addiction, which is a misuse of drugs. The user is talking about not being able to quit, which indicates dependency. The use of "lean" as a slang term for crack cocaine is a clear indicator of illicit drug use. Since the content is about trying to quit but failing, it's related to abuse. Therefore, this should be classified as True.
