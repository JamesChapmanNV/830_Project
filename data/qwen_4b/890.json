Okay, let's tackle this. The content mentions "morphine" and describes it as something taken from China, which is illegal. The user talks about its effects on the body, like making the dick hard or soft, and mentions it's from Kenya, supposed to cure scurvy in gorillas but causes masturbation in humans. The language is very explicit and seems to be promoting or glorifying the use of morphine, which is an illegal drug. The context here is about using morphine in a way that's not medical, but rather for recreational or abusive purposes. The slang and the description of its effects suggest misuse. So, according to the definitions, this would be classified as ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED.
