Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "Bro. Don't forget, he's Keith Richard's son. Good Anti whiskey and heroin genes."

First, I need to check if this is about illicit or abusive drugs. The mention of Keith Richard's son is a reference to a person with a possible genetic predisposition to drug use. The terms "Anti whiskey and heroin genes" are a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's a slang or a play on words. "Anti whiskey" might be a typo or a misphrasing. Alternatively, "Anti" could be part of a term like "anti-drug" but that doesn't fit. However, "heroin genes" is a euphemism for a genetic predisposition to drug addiction or abuse. The phrase "Good Anti whiskey and heroin genes" seems to be using "anti" in a way that's not standard. Maybe it's meant to say "anti-drug" but that's not clear. However, the mention of heroin, which is an illicit drug, and the context of genetics related to drug use could be considered as referencing drug abuse. The user is pointing out that someone has a genetic tendency towards drug use, which could be seen as promoting or discussing the abuse of drugs. Even though it's not directly promoting use, the context of "genes" related to drug use might fall under the category of discussing drug abuse. So, the label would be True because it's referencing heroin (an illicit drug) and discussing genetic predisposition to drug use, which is related to abuse.
