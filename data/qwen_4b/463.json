Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a social media post that's talking about education, patient-centered care, and the War on Drugs. The key points here are the mention of addiction and overdose prevention, and the critique of the War on Drugs.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal or abusive drug use. The content mentions "addiction" and "overdose," which are related to drug use, but it's in the context of prevention and safer supply. The user is discussing medical or educational aspects, like making supply safer and ending the War on Drugs. 

The example given in the task includes a pharmacology lecture as False because it's educational. Similarly, this content is discussing public health and policy, not promoting or glorifying drug use. The mention of "addiction" is in a discouraging context, talking about prevention. The phrase "true patient-centered care" and "making the supply safer" are about harm reduction, not abuse. 

The user also mentions ending the War on Drugs, which is a political stance, but not directly about drug abuse. There's no mention of specific drugs, slang, or promoting misuse. So, the content is about education and policy, not illicit drug use. Therefore, it should be classified as False.
