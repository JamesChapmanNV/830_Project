Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify the content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content given is: "Presumably, because he died of a drug overdose."

First, I need to check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promoting use. Also, slang or euphemisms that indicate recreational use or abuse. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts, or drug terms in unrelated contexts.

The content here mentions "drug overdose." The key is whether this is in a context that's promoting abuse or misuse. The phrase "died of a drug overdose" is a statement about someone's death due to an overdose. That's a consequence of drug use, but does it imply abuse or promotion? 

The sentence is stating a cause of death, which is a negative outcome. However, the term "drug overdose" itself is a result of drug use, which could be related to abuse. But the context here is just a statement about someone's death. There's no explicit mention of promoting, using, or encouraging drug use. It's more of a factual statement about a cause of death. 

But wait, the definition says that True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. Here, "drug overdose" is a result of misuse, but the content is not promoting or glorifying it. It's just a statement about a cause of death. So maybe this is not promoting abuse. However, the term "drug" could be part of a slang or euphemism. But "overdose" is a direct result of drug use, which is related to abuse. However, the content is not about the use of drugs, but rather the consequence. 

Alternatively, maybe the term "drug overdose" is considered as part of the abuse context. But the example given in the problem's first example mentions "hooked" and "codeine" with an approving tone. This content is neutral, just stating a cause of death. So the classification would be False because it's not promoting or encouraging misuse, just stating a fact. 

Wait, but the definition says that True includes content that mentions illegal, RX, or OTC drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The content here is about a death due to overdose, which is a result of misuse. However, the content itself isn't promoting or discussing the misuse. It's just a statement. So according to the definitions, it's not promoting, encouraging, or glorifying. Therefore, it's False. 

So the answer would be False because the content is a statement about a cause of death, not promoting or encouraging drug use. The terms "drug overdose" are in a context of a negative outcome, not abuse or misuse in a promotional way.
