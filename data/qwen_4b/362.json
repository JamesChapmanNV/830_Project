Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet that's asking if someone's messed up because of heavy drug use and lists specific drugs like heroin, opioids, fentanyl, crack. They also mention losing brothers to drugs and urge help.

First, I need to check if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The content directly mentions specific drugs (heroin, opioids, fentanyl, crack) which are illegal. The tone is concerned and suggests that the person's behavior might be due to drug use. The mention of losing brothers to drugs implies a negative context, but the question is whether it's promoting or glorifying misuse. However, the user is asking if the person's behavior is due to drug use, not necessarily promoting it. But the question is about the content itself. The content is questioning someone's drug use and urging help, which could be seen as encouraging seeking help, not promoting abuse. However, the mention of specific drugs and the context of drug use (like losing brothers) might be considered as discussing drug abuse. But the example given in the task includes content that mentions drugs in a context of abuse, like "hooked on codeine." Here, the content is asking about someone's drug use, which could be seen as discussing drug abuse. However, the user is not promoting it, but rather questioning. But according to the definitions, if it's mentioning illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse, even if it's a question, it might be considered. The example 1 had "hooked" which is a sign of abuse. Here, the content is asking about drug use, which could be part of discussing abuse. Also, the mention of specific drugs and the context of being "messed up" could be seen as relating to drug abuse. So the label would be True. But wait, the example 2 was a pharmacology lecture which was False because it's educational. Here, the content is more about questioning someone's drug use and urging help, which might be considered as discussing drug abuse. Therefore, the answer is True.

    "label": "True",
    "explanation": "The content explicitly mentions illegal drugs (heroin, opioids, fentanyl, crack) and implies drug abuse through phrases like'messed up' and 'lost two older brothers to drugs.'"
