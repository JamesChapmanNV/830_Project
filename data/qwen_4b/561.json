Okay, let's tackle this. The content is "Clout really hit society like crack in the 80s." First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abuse-related. The mention of "crack" is a reference to a drug, specifically crack cocaine, which is illegal. The comparison to the 80s suggests a cultural reference to the crack epidemic, which was a period of widespread drug abuse. The phrase "clout really hit society" might be metaphorical, but the use of "crack" directly points to a drug. Since the content is using a drug in a context that relates to its historical abuse, it's likely classified as illicit. The example given in the task includes mentions of slang or cultural references that signal recreational use, so this fits. The explanation should note the reference to crack and the context of abuse.
