Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify the content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content given is: "Doesn't the FDA/U$ Govt equate Cannabis with heroin? I wouldn't believe much coming out of the white wash house!"

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal or abused drugs. The user is talking about cannabis and heroin. Cannabis is a drug, but the context here is a question about the FDA and government equating them. The second part is a statement about distrust in government, but not directly about drug use.

The key here is to see if there's any indication of abuse, misuse, promotion, or glorification. The question is about government classification, not about using or promoting drugs. The terms "white wash house" might be a reference to government misinformation, but not directly related to drug abuse.

Looking at the definitions, True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. However, this content is more about government policies and skepticism towards them, not about drug use. There's no mention of using, buying, or promoting drugs. The terms are used in a political or regulatory context, not a recreational or abusive one.

So, the answer should be False because the content is discussing government classification and distrust, not promoting or abusing drugs. The explanation should note that the content is about government policy, not drug abuse.
