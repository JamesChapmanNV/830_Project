Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "Let's see now, one protestor died from a drug overdose, 2 from heart attacks, one was murdered by a policeman, and a policeman died of a state secret."

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The key is to check if it mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The content mentions "drug overdose," which is a medical term related to drug use. However, the context here is a report of deaths during a protest. The mention of "drug overdose" is part of a list of causes of death, not promoting or discussing drug use. There's no indication of illegal drugs being used in a way that's abusive or promoting their use. The terms "heart attacks" and "murdered by a policeman" are unrelated to drugs. The phrase "state secret" is vague but not related to drug abuse. Since the content is reporting on deaths without encouraging or glorifying drug use, it's more of a factual statement rather than illicit content. Therefore, the label should be False.
