Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a social media post that says: "When a girl has Codeine snaps at night then snaps of her kids soccer game in the morning, it's like wtf.. Parenting 101 or..?ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚ #PoorKids". 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key here is to check if there's any mention of illegal drugs, misuse, or promotion. The term "Codeine" is mentioned. Codeine is a controlled substance, typically used in medications, but it's also a controlled drug. However, the context here is a bit tricky. The user is talking about a girl who has codeine and then takes snaps (probably photos) at night and morning. The phrase "hooked on that lean everyday" in the first example was about abuse, but here, the context is different.

Wait, the user is using codeine in a context that seems to be about a person's behavior. The phrase "has codeine" could be referring to someone using it. But the rest of the content is about her snapping photos, which is a bit confusing. The user is asking if this is parenting 101 or something else, with a hashtag #PoorKids. 

But the main point is whether codeine is being mentioned in a context of abuse or misuse. The user might be implying that the girl is using codeine, which is a controlled substance. However, the content doesn't explicitly state that she's using it for abuse. It's more about her behavior, like snapping photos at different times. The mention of codeine is in the context of a person's daily routine, but without clear indication of misuse or abuse. 

The hashtag #PoorKids might be a red herring. The key is whether codeine is being used in a way that's illicit or abusive. Since codeine is a controlled substance, but the content doesn't clearly indicate that it's being misused. It's possible that the person is using codeine as part of a medical treatment, but the context isn't clear. However, the user is using the term "has codeine" which could be a slang for using it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to codeine in a non-misuse context. But given that codeine is a controlled substance, and the content is about a person's behavior that might be related to its use, it's possible that this is considered illicit. However, the example given in the task had "hooked on codeine" which was classified as true. In this case, the content doesn't explicitly say she's using it for abuse, but the mention of codeine in a context that might be related to misuse. 

Wait, the example #1 had "hooked on that lean everyday she say she want codeine" which was considered true because of the context of abuse. Here, the content is "has codeine" which is more neutral. But the user is talking about her snapping at night and morning, which might be a way to imply that she's using codeine. However, without explicit mention of abuse or misuse, maybe it's not. 

Alternatively, the use of codeine in the context of someone's daily routine, even if not explicitly abusive, might still be considered as mentioning a controlled substance. But according to the definitions, True includes mentions of illegal, RX, or OTC drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. So if the content is just mentioning codeine without context of abuse, maybe it's not. But the user is using "has codeine" which could be a slang for using it. 

Hmm. The user is using "has codeine" which is a bit ambiguous. If the content is about someone using codeine in a way that's not clearly for medical purposes, but just mentioning it, then it might be considered as illicit. However, the example given in the task had "hooked on codeine" which was classified as true. So in this case, the content is more about the person's behavior, but the mention of codeine is there. 

Alternatively, maybe the content is not about abuse but just a normal mention. But codeine is a controlled substance, so mentioning it without context could be a red flag. However, the example in the task had "hooked" which implies abuse. In this case, the content doesn't have that. 

So the label would be False because the content is not promoting or glorifying misuse, but just mentioning codeine in a context that's not clearly about abuse. The explanation would be that the content mentions codeine in a general context without indicating abuse or misuse. Therefore, the answer is False.
