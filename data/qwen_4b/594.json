Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a story where someone mentions that several people told them they heard they died of a heroin overdose, even though they never used drugs. The key here is to determine if this content is related to illicit or abusive drug use.

First, I need to check if the content mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The mention of "heroin overdose" is a direct reference to an illegal drug. However, the context here is a personal account where the person never used drugs. The story is about others' perceptions, not the person's own use. 

The definitions say that True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. But here, the person is not using drugs; they're talking about others who might have. However, the content doesn't promote or glorify drug use. It's more about a tragic event that others believed happened. 

The explanation in the example 1 mentions the tone being approving. In this case, the tone is more about a personal experience and others' reactions. There's no encouragement or promotion of drug misuse. The mention of heroin is in a context of a past event that was a misunderstanding. 

So, even though heroin is an illicit drug, the content isn't about abuse or misuse by the person. It's a narrative about others' beliefs. Therefore, it's more of a false classification because it's not promoting or encouraging drug use. The terms are used in a different context, not related to abuse or misuse. Hence, the label should be False.
