Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify the given content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is about people who said "drug overdose" and moved on, asking where the retractions, apologies, etc., are. They mention some people having no shame or decency.

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal drugs, abuse, or promotion. The content talks about "drug overdose," which is a serious issue, but the context here is about people who discussed it and moved on. The user is criticizing others for not retracting their statements, but there's no explicit mention of drug use, abuse, or promoting misuse. The terms are in a general sense, not specific to illegal drugs. The tone is about lack of accountability, not about drug-related activities. So, it's more about social conduct than drug abuse. Therefore, it's not illicit or abusive drug-related. The answer should be False.
