Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "Police, fuck the police I where cocaine, sippin codeine it's the same thing". First, I need to check if this is illicit or abuse-related. The user mentioned cocaine and codeine, which are both drugs. The phrase "I where cocaine" might be a typo for "I was using cocaine". The mention of codeine and the comparison "it's the same thing" suggests they're equating the two, which could imply misuse or abuse. Also, the tone is negative towards police, which might indicate a context of drug use. The use of slang like "sippin" and the mention of codeine (which is an opioid) could be part of a discussion about drug abuse. The user is talking about using these substances, which are illegal or controlled substances. So, this seems to fit the True category because it's about using and possibly promoting drug use.
