Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided the line: "Drank so much codeine, drinking til im colour blind, she gon' do the coke until she can see the line." 

First, I need to check if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The mention of "codeine" is a controlled substance, so that's a red flag. Then there's "do the coke," which is slang for cocaine. The context here is about drinking codeine to the point of losing color vision, which sounds like abuse. The phrase "gon' do the coke until she can see the line" suggests continued use despite negative effects, which is a sign of misuse or addiction.

The example given in the task mentions that True includes content that promotes or glorifies drug misuse. Here, the speaker is describing the negative consequences of using codeine and cocaine, but the act of using them repeatedly is still considered abuse. The tone seems to be about the harmful effects, but the key point is the mention of specific drugs in a context that implies misuse. 

I should also check if there's any educational or medical context, but there's none here. The terms are used in a way that's not about treatment but about the negative outcomes of use. So, the label should be True.
