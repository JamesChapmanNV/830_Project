Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "fans calling it karma like he himself wasn't an addict w a peddling gf/ dealer for the rich and famus ðŸ‘€ dramatic ass". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The user mentioned "addict" and "peddling gf/ dealer for the rich and famus". The term "addict" directly relates to drug abuse. Also, "peddling" might imply selling drugs, which is illegal. The context seems to be about someone being an addict and having a girlfriend who is a dealer, which could be related to drug dealing or abuse. The use of "dramatic ass" might be a slang or expression, but the key here is the mention of addiction and dealing. 

Since the content refers to someone being an addict and a dealer, which are related to drug abuse and illegal activities, this would fall under ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED. The explanation should note the mention of addiction and the dealer role, indicating abuse or promotion.
