Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is: "Morrison in deep with this crack head is really very telling." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key terms here are "crack head." Crack is a slang term for crack cocaine, which is an illegal drug. The phrase "in deep with" suggests association or involvement with someone who uses crack. The term "crack head" is a derogatory term used to describe someone addicted to crack cocaine, which is a form of drug abuse.

Looking at the definitions, True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The mention of "crack" directly points to an illicit drug. The phrase "in deep with" implies being involved with someone who is using it, which could be seen as promoting or glorifying the abuse. Additionally, the term "crack head" is a slang that signals recreational drug use or abuse. 

The example given in the prompt where "lean" and "codeine" were considered illicit because they relate to drug abuse supports this. Here, "crack" is clearly an illegal drug, and the context of being "in deep with" someone who is a "crack head" suggests association with drug use. There's no mention of medical or educational context here, so it doesn't fall under the False category. 

Therefore, the classification should be True because it's referencing illegal drug use in a context that implies being involved with someone addicted to crack cocaine, which is a form of abuse.
