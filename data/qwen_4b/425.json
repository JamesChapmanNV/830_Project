Okay, let's see. The user provided a content snippet: "Also he ex boyfriend was a drug dealer. The man who shot at the cops was a legal gun owner. That is why he was never prosecuted." I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED (True) or NOT (False).

First, I'll check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in abuse contexts, slang, or encouraging misuse. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts. 

Looking at the content, it talks about an ex-boyfriend being a drug dealer. The term "drug dealer" is related to illegal drugs. However, the context here is a statement about someone's past, not promoting or encouraging drug use. The mention of a drug dealer is more about the person's role in illegal activities rather than discussing drug use itself. The second part mentions a legal gun owner, which is unrelated to drugs. The explanation about not being prosecuted is about legal consequences, not drug abuse or promotion.

So, the content mentions a drug dealer, which is illegal, but the context is not about abuse, misuse, or promoting drugs. It's more about a person's past criminal activity. Therefore, it doesn't fit the True category. The explanation should note that the mention of a drug dealer is in a context of someone's past crime, not promoting or discussing drug abuse. Hence, the label should be False.
