Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify the given content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is: "Lost my little mans 4 days ago to a overdose. Please stop with xans man. Begging yall folk. üíî. Lub Bookie üîµ‚ö´Ô∏è"

First, I need to check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal, RX, or OTC drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, promoting, etc. Also, slang, euphemisms, or cultural references indicating recreational use or abuse. Encouraging or glorifying drug misuse.

The content mentions "overdose" and "xans". "Xans" is slang for Xanax, which is a controlled substance. The person is talking about losing someone to an overdose, which is a serious issue related to drug abuse. The phrase "Please stop with xans man" is a plea to stop using Xanax, which is a drug. The mention of overdose indicates misuse or abuse. The emotional tone is tragic and urgent, which might be a way to highlight the problem. 

The example given in the task has similar elements, like mentioning codeine and "hooked", which is classified as True. Here, the content is about a personal loss due to drug overdose, which is a clear case of drug abuse. The mention of Xanax (xans) is a specific drug, and the context of overdose is a direct indicator of misuse. 

The other example was a pharmacology lecture, which is educational and not promoting misuse. This content is personal and emotional, indicating a real-life consequence of drug abuse. So, the label here should be True.
