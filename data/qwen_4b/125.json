Okay, let's see. The content is about Cephalon getting FDA approval for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for FENTORA and ACTIQ, which are medications. The mention of "signs of drug abuse" here is part of the FDA's requirements for these drugs. The key point is that this is a regulatory approval related to managing the risks of these medications, which are used for opioid addiction treatment. The content doesn't promote or encourage drug abuse; instead, it's about ensuring proper use and preventing misuse. So, the context is medical and regulatory, not about abuse or promotion. Therefore, the label should be False.
