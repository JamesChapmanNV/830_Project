Okay, let's see. The user provided some content that needs classification as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content is: "WTS/LFB PH EXO üìå ON HAND AND READY TO SHIP ‚ùå Overdose (Kr Ver) SOLD still available, Miracles in December (Kor Ver), The Power of Music üìå PB + CD Only". 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of illegal drugs, misuse, or promotion. The user is a content moderator, so I have to be careful. The terms "Overdose" and "Kr Ver" might be relevant. "Kr Ver" could be an abbreviation, maybe "Korean Version" or something else. But "Overdose" is a strong term related to drug misuse. However, the context here seems to be selling products, possibly music or merchandise. The mention of "Overdose" might be part of the product title, like a song title or a band name. For example, "Overdose" could be a song by a band, and "Kr Ver" might be a Korean version. The rest of the content is about selling items, so it's a listing for products. There's no explicit mention of drug use, abuse, or promotion. The user is selling products, not discussing drug-related topics. The overdose mention might be a song title, not related to drug abuse. Therefore, the content is not about illicit drugs. So the label should be False.
