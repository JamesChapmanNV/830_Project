Okay, let's tackle this query. The content is about a US novelist's son who died of a drug overdose, and he was awaiting trial for killing his daughter with heroin and fentanyl. 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key here is the context. The son died from an overdose, which is a result of drug abuse. The mention of heroin and fentanyl are both illegal drugs. The fact that he was using them and causing harm to his daughter indicates misuse and abuse.

The definitions say that True includes content that mentions illegal drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The content here clearly states that the son died from an overdose, which is a direct result of drug abuse. Also, the mention of heroin and fentanyl, which are both illicit drugs, and the context of his actions (using them and causing harm) fits the True category. 

The example given in the prompt where a death from overdose was classified as True makes sense here. Even though it's a tragic event, the content is about the misuse of drugs leading to death. There's no mention of medical or educational context here, so it's not False. Therefore, the label should be True.
