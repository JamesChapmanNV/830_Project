Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to classify the given content as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. The content provided is a bit cryptic and seems to reference Mac Miller's overdose and some social commentary about Black people's issues. 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs in the context of abuse or misuse. The content mentions "overdose," which is a drug-related term, but it's in the context of a person's death. However, the user's task is to look for content that promotes, encourages, or glorifies drug abuse. 

The phrase "Why does she only appear when it's Black people's business?" seems to be a critique of societal issues, possibly related to systemic problems. The mention of "r&b album" might be a cultural reference, but not directly related to drug abuse. 

The key here is whether the content is promoting or glorifying drug use. The overdose is a tragic event, but the content doesn't seem to be encouraging or promoting drug use. Instead, it's more about social justice issues. 

So, the content doesn't mention illegal drugs in a context of abuse or misuse. It's more about discussing a social issue related to a person's death, not promoting or encouraging drug use. Therefore, it should be classified as NOT ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED.
