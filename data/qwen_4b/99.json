Okay, let's see. The user provided a content snippet: "I am Mexican and I'm not a drug dealer üëç". I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT. 

First, I'll check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promotion. Also, slang or references to recreational use. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts.

The content here is a statement about someone's nationality and their claim not to be a drug dealer. There's no mention of drugs, illegal activities, or any context of abuse. The user is stating their identity and denying a role in drug dealing. The emoji is just a positive affirmation. 

There's no indication of drug use, promotion, or abuse here. The terms used are about nationality and a denial of a specific role. So, this doesn't fit the criteria for True. It's more of a personal statement without any drug-related content. Therefore, the correct classification should be False.
