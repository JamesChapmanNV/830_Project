Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about Rolando McClain struggling with codeine addiction and gaining weight. The user wants to know if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related.

First, I need to check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal or abused drugs, slang, or encouragement of misuse. False is medical, educational, or preventative context.

The content mentions "codeine addiction," which is a misuse issue. The phrase "struggling with addiction" indicates a problem related to abuse. The hashtag #RTR might be relevant, but the main point is the addiction. The context here is about someone having a drug problem, which fits the True category because it's discussing abuse. The explanation should note the mention of codeine addiction and the negative context of struggling with it.

    "label": "True",
    "explanation": "The content mentions 'codeine addiction' and describes a negative outcome ('gained 40 pounds'), indicating drug abuse and related consequences."
