Okay, let's tackle this. The content is about a mother forcing her 6-year-old son to overdose on meth, cocaine, and other drugs to collect a $100,000 insurance payout. First, I need to check if this is illicit or abusive drug-related.

The key terms here are meth and cocaine, which are illegal drugs. The context is about forcing a child to overdose, which is clearly abuse. The mention of drug use in a harmful, abusive context fits the definition of ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED. The mother's actions are promoting drug misuse for financial gain, which is encouraging abuse. So the label should be True. The explanation should note the illegal drugs mentioned and the abusive context.
