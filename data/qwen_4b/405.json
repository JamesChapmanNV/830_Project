Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a statement that says, "Because every cop's a racist and nobody ever dies from drug overdose. Tom Petty died in his sleep from opioids, very sad." 

First, I need to determine if this is illicit/abusive-drug-related. The key here is to check if the content mentions illegal drugs in a context of abuse, misuse, or promotion. The mention of "opiates" is a drug, but the context here is about Tom Petty's death. The user is talking about a real person's death from opioids, which is a medical context. 

The phrase "nobody ever dies from drug overdose" might be a bit controversial, but the main point is that the content is discussing a real-life death from opioids. There's no explicit promotion, encouragement, or abuse. The user is just stating a fact about a person's death. The mention of "opiates" is in a medical context, not in a way that suggests misuse or abuse. 

Also, the first part about cops being racist is a political statement, which is unrelated to drug abuse. The overall content is not encouraging or glorifying drug use. Therefore, it's more of a factual statement about a death, not promoting or discussing drug abuse. So the label should be False.
