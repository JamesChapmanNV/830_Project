Okay, let's tackle this. The content provided is about overdose statistics, mentioning numbers of overdoses and that people can overdose again. The key here is to determine if this is related to illicit or abusive drug use.

First, the content doesn't mention any specific drugs. It's talking about overdoses in general. The terms used are "overdoses" and "same people" but no drugs are named. The context is about statistics and public health response. 

According to the definitions, False includes content that mentions drugs in a medical, educational, or preventative context. This seems to be a report on overdose incidents, which is a public health issue. There's no promotion or encouragement of drug misuse here. It's just reporting data. 

The example given in the task had a pharmacology lecture which was False because it was educational. Similarly, this content is factual and doesn't glorify or promote drug use. So the label should be False. The explanation should note that it's discussing overdose statistics without promoting or misusing drugs.
