Okay, let's tackle this. The content is: "U one of them niggas that don't believe shit he died from overdose." First, I need to determine if this is illicit or abusive drug-related. The key terms here are "overdose." Overdose is a direct indicator of drug abuse or misuse. The user is talking about someone who died from an overdose, which is a severe consequence of drug use. The phrase "don't believe shit" might be a derogatory comment, but the main point is the mention of overdose. Since overdose is a clear sign of drug abuse, this would fall under ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED. The explanation should note the mention of overdose and the context of death from it, which relates to drug abuse.
