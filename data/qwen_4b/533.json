Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a content snippet: "I'm tryna overdose on her booty. sniff the butt crack." I need to classify this as either ILLICIT/ABUSIVE-DRUG-RELATED or NOT.

First, I'll check the definitions. True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse, misuse, or promoting it. Also, slang or euphemisms related to drug use. False includes medical, educational, or preventative contexts.

The content uses "overdose" and "sniff the butt crack." "Sniffing" is a method of drug use, and "overdose" is a severe consequence of misuse. The phrase "overdose on her booty" is likely a slang reference to drug use, possibly cocaine or other substances. The mention of "butt crack" could be a euphemism for a drug-related activity. The tone seems to be encouraging or glorifying the act, which fits the True category. There's no educational or medical context here. So the label should be True.
