Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a message that mentions someone passing away from an OD (overdose), and the family says he got a vaccine and had a heart attack. The person is expressing that they don't think it was OD-related and that reports no longer include overdose. 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs in a way that's illicit or abusive. The content talks about an OD, which is a drug-related term, but the context here is about a person's death and the family's perspective. The mention of a vaccine and heart attack is unrelated to drug abuse. The user is discussing a medical event but not promoting or encouraging drug use. There's no indication of slang, euphemisms, or encouragement of misuse. The focus is on the family's statement and the change in reporting, not on drug abuse. So, according to the definitions, this would fall under False because it's not promoting or glorifying drug misuse. The terms are used in a medical or reporting context, not in a way that suggests abuse.
