Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided a message that says: "Lol you need to write a book beef. You crack me up. Are you feeling better. Any word from the vettyman?" 

First, I need to check if there's any mention of drugs, either illegal, prescription, or over-the-counter. The words here are "book beef," "crack me up," and "vettyman." "Vettyman" might be a slang term, but I'm not sure. "Crack" can sometimes refer to cocaine, but in this context, it's more likely a slang for something else, maybe a joke. The rest of the message is about writing a book and feeling better. 

Looking at the definitions, True includes mentions of illegal drugs in contexts of abuse or misuse. The term "vettyman" could be a misspelling of "vet," but that's not a drug. "Book beef" is unclear, but not a drug reference. The tone is light-hearted, not promoting or glorifying drug use. There's no indication of abuse or encouragement of drug misuse. The terms used don't fit the definitions of True. So the classification should be False.
