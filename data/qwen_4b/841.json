Okay, let's tackle this content. The user provided the text: "Got Promethzine & Codeine üçáüçº  All N My Belly #RIPSwiepy". First, I need to identify if this is illicit or abusive drug-related.

Promethzine is a medication, but codeine is an opioid. The mention of codeine might be a red flag. The hashtags like #RIPSwiepy could be a reference to a person, maybe a friend or someone who passed away. The phrase "All N My Belly" could be slang for having drugs, like "all in my belly" meaning using drugs. The use of codeine in combination with Promethzine might be for misuse, especially if it's being used without medical supervision. The tone here seems to be about having drugs, possibly in a way that's not medical. The hashtags might indicate a memorial, but the content itself is about possessing and using drugs. So, this fits the True category because it mentions codeine, which is an opioid, and the context suggests misuse or abuse. The slang and the mention of codeine in a personal context without a medical justification point towards illicit use.
