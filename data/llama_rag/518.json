                    France: In France, most preparations containing codeine do not require a doctor's prescription. Example products containing codeine include Néocodion (cough pills, and syrup), Codoliprane (codeine with paracetamol), Prontalgine and Migralgine (codeine, paracetamol, and caffeine).[16] Codeine is regulated/controlled substance (schedule 2) since 2017 after a decision of the "Minister of Health" Agnès Buzyn, it is therefore now under prescription only and raw pure codeine is not available altogether anymore. The most common prescribed codeine brands are Klipal and Codoliprane, both mixed with paracetamol heavily. Klipal being the strongest ratio, 50mg codeine for 600mg paracetamol.
