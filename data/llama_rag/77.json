Drug: Codeine | cid: 5284371
Source: psychonaut | Source description: Codeine (also known as 3-Methylmorphine) is a naturally-occurring opioid substance of the morphinan class found in extracts of the poppy, particularly Papaver bracteatum.[3] Members of this group produce effects such as sedation, cough suppression, and euphoria when administered.

Mu opioid agonist - 589 nM

Kappa opioid agonist - 18061 nM

Delta opioid agonist - 11442 nM

Subjective effects

Disclaimer: The effects listed below cite the Subjective Effect Index (SEI), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of PsychonautWiki contributors. As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.

It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. Likewise, adverse effects become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include addiction, severe injury, or death â˜ .

Physical effects

The general head space of codeine is described by many as one of euphoria, relaxation, anxiety suppression, and pain relief.

Pain relief

The general head space of codeine is described by many as one of euphoria, relaxation, anxiety suppression, and pain relief.

Pain relief

Physical euphoria - This particular substance can be considered as less intense in its physical euphoria when compared with that of morphine or diacetylmorphine (heroin) due to the upper limit of how much can be converted into its active form through metabolism. The sensation itself can be described as extreme feelings of intense physical comfort, warmth and bliss which spreads throughout the body.

Itchiness - This compound presents greater amounts of itchiness due to higher amounts of histamine release in comparison to other opioids.


                    Context: 
                    This section details the physical effects of codeine, including its typical head space of euphoria, relaxation, and pain relief, as well as specific effects like physical euphoria and increased itchiness due to histamine release. It provides essential information on how codeine influences the body at different doses, making it vital for understanding its subjective impact and safety considerations within the comprehensive drug profile.

                    Text: 
                    Codeine is the second most predominant alkaloid in opium (up to three percent).[citation needed] Although codeine can be extracted from natural sources, a semi-synthetic process is the primary source of codeine for pharmaceutical use. It is considered the prototype of the weak to midrange opioids (tramadol, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine and hydrocodone.[citation needed]

Codeine is currently the most widely used opiate in the world,[4][5] and is one of the most commonly used drugs overall according to numerous reports by organizations including the World Health Organization and its League of Nations predecessor agency. It is one of the most effective orally administered opioid analgesics and has a wide safety margin.

Recreationally, it is usually purchased over the counter within painkillers that mix it with other more toxic substances. These can be separated using a cold water extraction technique.
