Drug: Hydrocodone | cid: 5284569
Source: psychonaut | Source description: Hydrocodone (commonly sold as Vicodin or Norco when combined with paracetamol) is a semi-synthetic opioid morphinan synthesized or chemically derived from codeine, one of the opioid alkaloids found in the opium poppy. It is a narcotic analgesic used orally as a cough suppressant, but also commonly taken orally for relief of moderate to severe pain.[2] Those who take hydrocodone for recreational purposes report a sense of relaxation and euphoria, especially at higher doses.

                    Text: 
                    Hydrocodone also shares the 3-methoxy substitution found in codeine; the two differ only from their R6 substituents. Hydrocodone is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, heroin, ethylmorphine, codeine, and oxycodone.

Pharmacology

The euphoria, anxiety suppression and pain relief effects appear to stem from the way in which opioids mimic endogenous endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's effects. It acts primarily on μ-opioid receptors, with about six times lesser affinity to δ-opioid receptors.

In the liver, hydrocodone is transformed into several metabolites. It has a serum half-life that averages 3.8 hours.[4] The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 converts it into hydromorphone, a more potent opioid.


                    Context: 
                    This excerpt covers the chemical structure and pharmacological mechanisms of hydrocodone, highlighting its similarity to codeine, its action on μ-opioid receptors, and its metabolism into hydromorphone via CYP2D6. It provides critical details on its chemical properties and how it produces effects like euphoria, pain relief, and sedation, making it essential for understanding the drug's composition and biological activity.

                    Text: 
                    Hydrocodone is prescribed predominantly within the United States, with the International Narcotics Control Board reporting that 99% of the worldwide supply in 2007 was consumed in the United States.[3]

Like many opioids, such as dextropropoxyphene, hydrocodone is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to enhance analgesia and deter abuse. Acetaminophen overdoses and long-term use, often due to recreational use, can cause serious or fatal liver damage. Currently, the only brand of hydrocodone in the United States that does not have acetaminophen is Zohydro ER which comes in doses of up to 50mg.
