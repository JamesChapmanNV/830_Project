Specific drugs and antidotes. 1. Naloxone is a specific opioid antagonist with no agonist properties of its own; large doses may be given safely.... Caution: The duration of effect of naloxone (1-2 hours) is shorter than that of many opioids. Therefore, do not release a patient who has awakened after naloxone treatment until at least 3-4 hours has passed since the last dose of naloxone. In general, if naloxone was required to reverse opioid-induced coma, it is safer to admit the patient for at least 6-12 hours of observation. 2. Nalmefene is an opioid antagonist with a longer duration of effect (3-5 hours).... /Opiates and opioids/

                    Naloxone/naltrexone are robust opioid antagonists that function by blocking Âµ-receptors. The FDA has approved these antidote medications for emergency treatment of patients with known or suspected opioid overdose experiencing respiratory and/or central nervous system (CNS) depression. Common routes of naloxone administration include IV, IM, IN, or subcutaneous (SC). Researchers have recently posed a caveat regarding the intranasal route for naloxone administration. Since the incidence of obstructive nasal pathology is relatively high in patients who experience serious OIRD, there is documentation of relevant instances of treatment failures when using the IN formulations.

Also, an IV neuromuscular blocker may be employed in cases of severe muscular rigidity to assist the controlled respiration treatments.


                    Context: 
                    This excerpt provides information on opioid overdose reversal agents, specifically naloxone and naltrexone, including their approved use, administration routes, and limitations such as potential failure of intranasal delivery due to nasal pathology. It highlights critical intervention options for opioid toxicity within the broader context of fentanyl's pharmacology, hazards, and emergency treatments discussed in the full document.

Nalmefene is an opioid antagonist with a longer duration of effect (3-5 hours).... Caution: Although the duration of effect of nalmefene is longer than that of naloxone, it is still much shorter than that of methadone. If a methadone overdose is suspected, the patient should be observed for at least 8-12 hours after the last dose of nalmefene. Sodium bicarbonate may be effective for QRS-interval prolongation or hypotension associated with propoxyphene poisoning.


                    Context: 
                    This excerpt details the use of opioid antagonists, specifically naloxone and nalmefene, in emergency overdose management, highlighting dosing safety, duration of action, and observation protocols. It is relevant to pharmacological and toxicity sections of the full document, providing critical information on safe administration, patient monitoring, and treatment duration for opioid overdose reversal. Key details include duration of effect differences, cautionary observation periods, and adjunct treatments like sodium bicarbonate for specific poisoning cases.
