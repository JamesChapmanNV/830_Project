Post: 2) Drug overdose. Opioids affect your breathing. When you take too high a dose, it can slow down your breathing to the point that your body does not take in enough oxygen.

### Input 
Post: Heavy dosages of oxymorphone can result in respiratory depression, leading onto fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.
Oxymorphone can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).

It is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.

### RAG Chunks
Drug: Oxymorphone | cid: 5284604
Source: psychonaut | Source description: Oxymorphone (also known by the brand name Opana) is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic used in the management of moderate to severe pain, and is similar in structure to other opioids such as morphine and heroin. Oxymorphone was first developed in Germany in 1914[2]and introduced to the American market in 1959.[3] Unlike many other opioids, oxymorphone is almost devoid of antitussive properties.[4]Oxymorphone is an important precursor to other opioids and opioid antagonists such as naloxone.

Opioid overdoses can be treated by calling the local emergency number and administering an opioid antagonist such as naloxone.

Source: psychonaut | Source description: Morphine is a naturally-occurring opioid substance of the morphinan class. It is one of the natural plant alkaloids found in opium, along side codeine which is extracted from Papaver somniferum (also known as the poppy plant).[6] Additionally, it is considered to be the prototype opiate (i.e. the standard to which others are compared) and the basis of derivatives such as codeine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), and hydrocodone.
