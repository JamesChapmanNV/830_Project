### Example #5 
Post: Itchiness - Unlike other opioids, fentanyl presents very little itch response due to little to no amounts of released histamines.

Respiratory depression - In comparison to other opiates, fentanyl displays this effect at lower doses relative to euphoria than other opiates, and even at low doses results in the sensation that the breath is slowed down mildly to moderately, but does not cause noticeable impairment. At high doses and overdoses, opioid-induced respiratory depression can result in a shortness of breath, abnormal breathing patterns, semi-consciousness, or unconsciousness. Severe overdoses can result in a coma or death without immediate medical attention.
