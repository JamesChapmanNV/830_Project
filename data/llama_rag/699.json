This concentration is _so_ low that this FAQ will not be discussing cough syrups as a source of recreational codeine. The tablet form of OTC codeine products usually also includes 15 mg of caffeine in each standard dose. [In Canada the law dictates that all codeine OTC products must contain at least two other active ingredients. This usually translates into caffeine and acetominophen/APAP.] Prescription codeine containing products are usually not available without another drug included such as acetaminophen. Rx (prescription) products include the Tylenol w/ codeine series (#1,2,3,4) containing respectively 8 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg of codeine. Each tablet also contains caffeine in doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, 30 mg and 0 mg respectively.

This information is crucial for understanding legal limits, product variations, and extraction considerations discussed elsewhere in the document.

### Input Post 
Post: Moving from cough medicine to tablets with codeine in.  Fingers crossed this blooming cough will soon be gone.

### Output JSON 
[
  {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "codeine"},
  {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "codeine"},
  {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "codeine"}
]

### Reasoning 
The phrase "cough medicine" is not a match since it refers to a product category, not a specific substance. However, "codeine" is a specific substance mentioned in the post, and it matches the "Codeine" index term.
