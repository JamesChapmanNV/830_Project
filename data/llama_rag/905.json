Source: psychonaut | Source description: Fentanyl (also known as Fentanil and by the brand names Sublimaze,[2] Actiq, Durogesic, Duragesic, Fentora, Matrifen, Haldid, Onsolis, Instanyl,[3] Abstral,[4] Lazanda[5] among others[6]) is a potent opioid substance of the anilidopiperidine class. It is a strong agonist at the μ-opioid receptors and approximately 40 to 50 times more potent than pharmaceutical grade (i.e. 100% pure) heroin[7][8] and roughly 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine.&#91;citation needed&#93;

                    Text: 
                    In the mid-1990s, fentanyl was first introduced for widespread palliative use with the clinical introduction of the Duragesic patch. It was followed in the next decade by the introduction of the first quick-acting prescription formulations of fentanyl for personal use, the Actiq lollipop and Fentora buccal through the delivery method of estradiol Mylan transdermal patches. As of 2012, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice[15] with several new delivery methods now available, including a sublingual spray for cancer patients.[16][17] In 2013, 1700 kilograms were used globally.[18]
