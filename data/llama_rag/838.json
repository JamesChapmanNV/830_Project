                    France: In France, most preparations containing codeine do not require a doctor's prescription. Example products containing codeine include Néocodion (cough pills, and syrup), Codoliprane (codeine with paracetamol), Prontalgine and Migralgine (codeine, paracetamol, and caffeine).[16] Codeine is regulated/controlled substance (schedule 2) since 2017 after a decision of the "Minister of Health" Agnès Buzyn, it is therefore now under prescription only and raw pure codeine is not available altogether anymore. The most common prescribed codeine brands are Klipal and Codoliprane, both mixed with paracetamol heavily. Klipal being the strongest ratio, 50mg codeine for 600mg paracetamol.

### Detection and Matching
To detect and match the given post with the RAG chunks, we will use the provided information.

Post: I got her hooked on that lean everyday she say she want codeine

The post contains two phrases that refer to an illicit drug or substance: "lean" and "codeine".

For "lean", we can match it with the index term "Codeine" because "lean" is a slang term for a mixture of codeine and soda.

For "codeine", we can directly match it with the index term "Codeine".

So, the output will be:
[{"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "lean"}, {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "codeine"}]

### JSON Output
[
  {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "lean"},
  {"index_term": "Codeine", "matched_phrase": "codeine"}
