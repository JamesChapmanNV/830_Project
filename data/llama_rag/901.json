Source: psychonaut | Source description: Fentanyl (also known as Fentanil and by the brand names Sublimaze,[2] Actiq, Durogesic, Duragesic, Fentora, Matrifen, Haldid, Onsolis, Instanyl,[3] Abstral,[4] Lazanda[5] among others[6]) is a potent opioid substance of the anilidopiperidine class. It is a strong agonist at the μ-opioid receptors and approximately 40 to 50 times more potent than pharmaceutical grade (i.e. 100% pure) heroin[7][8] and roughly 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine.&#91;citation needed&#93;

                    In the mid-1990s, fentanyl was first introduced for widespread palliative use with the clinical introduction of the Duragesic patch. It was followed in the next decade by the introduction of the first quick-acting prescription formulations of fentanyl for personal use, the Actiq lollipop and Fentora buccal through the delivery method of estradiol Mylan transdermal patches. As of 2012, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice[15] with several new delivery methods now available, including a sublingual spray for cancer patients.[16][17] In 2013, 1700 kilograms were used globally.[18]

                    Fentanyl sublingual tablets are 54% bioavailable, transmucosal lozenges are 50% bioavailable, buccal tablets are 65% bioavailable, sublingual spray is 76% bioavailable, and nasal spray is 20% more bioavailable than transmucosal (or approximately 64% bioavailable). Fentanyl transmucosal lozenges reach a Cmax of 0.4±0.1ng/mL for a 200µg dose and 2.5±0.6ng/mL for a 1600µg dose with a Tmax of 20-40 minutes. The AUC was 172±96ng\*min/mL for a 200µg dose and 1508±1360ng\*min/mL for a 1600µg dose. Fentanyl sublingual spray reached a Cmax of 0.20±0.06ng/mL for a 100µg dose and 1.61±0.60ng/mL for an 800µg dose with a Tmax of 0.69-1.25 hours, decreasing as the dose increased. The AUC was 1.25±0.67ng\*h/mL for a 100µg dose and 10.38±3.70ng\*h/mL for a 800µg dose. Fentanyl transdermal systems reached a Cmax of 0.24±0.20ng/mL with a Tmax of 3.6±1.3h for a 25µg/h dose. The AUC was 0.42±0.35ng/mL\*h. Fentanyl nasal spray reaches a Cmax of 815±301pg/mL with a Tmax of less than 1 hour for a

                    This section details the pharmacokinetic properties and absorption data for various fentanyl formulations, including sublingual tablets, transmucosal lozenges, buccal tablets, sprays, transdermal patches, and nasal sprays. It provides specific values for bioavailability, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax), time to peak (Tmax), and area under the curve (AUC) across different doses. This information is essential for understanding fentanyl's bioavailability, dosing, and delivery methods, situating it within the broader context of its medical use, safety, and pharmacology discussed in the document.
